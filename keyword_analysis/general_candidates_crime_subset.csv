0,"Jamaal's not running against Eliot Engel just because.
Jamaal Bowman for Congress
Alex,
It takes a lot to beat an entrenched incumbent. It's hard work, every single day. But Jamaal is taking on Eliot Engel because it has to be done.
For 30 years, Engel has sided with the likes of Wall Street, weapons manufacturers, and private, for-profit prisons. Time and time again, he has put these wealthy interests ahead of the people of his own district.
After seeing the real-world impact that Eliot Engel's votes have had, Jamaal decided to do something about it. He is committed to beating Engel with a grassroots, people-powered campaign that takes no money from corporate interests.
Like we said, it's hard work, every day. But it's possible because we have people like you supporting us. If you still believe in this campaign, can you chip in $15 (or whatever you can afford) to help us reach our $25,000 end-of-month goal?

Take a look at where they each stand:
✅ Jamaal believes in progressive foreign policy, taking care of veterans, and reducing spending on foreign wars and bombs…
❌ [[URL REDACTED]] Eliot Engel voted for the Iraq war and has taken more money from the weapons manufacturers than 144 House Republicans.
✅ Jamaal supports justice reform, including the repeal of the 1994 crime bill and banning private, for-profit prisons…
❌ [[URL REDACTED]] Eliot Engel championed the 1994 crime bill and did not support HR 3227, which would have banned private prisons and detention facilities.
✅ For nearly two decades, Jamaal served as a middle school principal and as an advocate for working-class families right here in the Bronx…
❌ [[URL REDACTED]] Eliot Engel spent over three decades in Congress voting for wars, Wall Street, and prisons over education and resources for working-class families.
Jamaal is ready to fight for all of these things, as well as for other bold, progressive solutions like Medicare for All and a Green New Deal.
But taking on an entrenched incumbent is hard work, and we expect it will only get tougher until Election Day on June 23. To keep our campaign going as strong as it is, we need to reach our end-of-month goal and raise at least $25,000 by midnight on Thursday.
If everyone who reads this pitches in, we'll get there in no time. But not everyone who reads this will give. Alex, can we count on you to step up and pitch in $15 (or whatever you can) so we can meet our $25,000 end-of-month goal?

1,"This is #MyBloombergStory.
Alex,
In the early 2000s, I was a young teacher, and Bloomberg was mayor.
Stop-and-frisk was a way of life, emboldening the police and perpetuating a culture of police harassment and brutality against the Black community. One day, as I drove home from work to pick up my son, I was pulled over on the Grand Concourse in the South Bronx by the cops. They said that I failed to use my turn signal to change lanes, but I knew that was bullshit. I knew I was pulled over for DWB: Driving While Black.
I was taken out of my car, handcuffed, and arrested. I spent hours in a cell, before I was released without even seeing a judge. No charge. No explanation. No apology.
This was just one example of a terrifying, dehumanizing experience I have had with the police as a Black man in America. Some people are trying to downplay stop-and-frisk. They don’t think Bloomberg should be held responsible for championing and defending this blatant violation of constitutional rights, a policy that disproportionately impacted people of color. I ask those naysayers this:
How can the Black community improve our academic, health, or economic outcomes while we’re living in perpetual terror?
I understand the challenges facing our communities in a way the incumbent never has and never will. Perhaps that's why Engel has consistently voted for tough-on-crime policies that have decimated communities of color.
We deserve a Representative who will actively speak out against racial injustice, and won't wait to be asked. A Representative who won't just say he supports the right solutions, but will be a leader in fighting to get them passed.
I hope my story inspires more black, brown, and working-class New Yorkers to share their stories about the pain Bloomberg caused in our communities.
Bloomberg has not shown he understands the pain he caused in our community -- at all. We deserve better from our leaders; that's why I am running for Congress. My campaign is about bringing us all together, combating apathy with a movement based in love and action. I hope you will join me in that spirit.
In solidarity,
Jamaal Bowman

2,"Yesterday, a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, repeatedly shot Jacob Blake in the back in front of his three children. There is no justification for this brutal, racist act, friends.
For Jacob Blake and every Black person terrorized by police in this country, we must act to demand immediate accountability and dismantle systemic racism. Pramila helped the House pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act two months ago. It’s long overdue that the Senate act. Will you join Pramila in calling on the Senate to pass the House’s Justice in Policing Act to take the urgent action needed to reimagine law enforcement?
ADD YOUR NAME
The Justice in Policing Act, which the House passed two months ago, is the most aggressive policing intervention introduced by Congress in recent memory. It would reimagine and rebuild policing by ending qualified immunity, banning chokeholds, classifying lynching as a federal hate crime, establishing a public federal police misconduct registry, and demilitarizing the police. Making this legislation law is a critical first step toward securing justice for Black and Brown communities in Wisconsin, Washington state, and across the country.
We cannot become complacent in our fight to see racial justice and stop police brutality. Add your name next to Pramila’s to demand that the Senate vote to pass the Justice in Policing Act to help bring about transformative change.

Mondaire Jones for Congress
Friend,
We have come a long way from the early days when only a handful of Democratic members of Congress were willing to call for this President’s impeachment. One of the reasons I got in this race was because I was so frustrated that Democratic leadership wasn’t acting with the type of urgency required to hold this President accountable for his rampant corruption.
Now we have finally impeached this President, yet Mitch McConnell refuses to call witnesses and hold a fair trial in the Senate. In America, no one is above the law and that includes this President. We need to call on Republicans in the Senate to do the right thing and to allow a fair trial so that we can put this President’s crimes front and center for all Americans to see.
When I’m in Congress, you can always count on me to do what’s right even when it’s not politically popular or expedient. Can you make a donation today to get us across the finish line and elect someone who will always do what’s right for the residents of New York’s 17th Congressional District?

Mondaire Jones for Congress
Friend, this is a defining moment for our country.
Earlier this week, House Democrats announced that they are moving forward with two articles of impeachment against President Trump. This is a monumental step toward holding Trump accountable for his crimes and showing that no one is above the law.
The Trump Administration is coming to an end -- either through impeachment and removal from office, or through next year’s election -- but the true test of our time will be what comes after.
Who will fix the mess that Trump has made of our government? How will we set a new standard in our politics and restore the meaning of a government for the people, by the people? The answer is electing progressive champions like Mondaire Jones.
He will usher in a new wave of people-first leadership and fight for the families who have been hurt most by Trump’s administration. Will you chip in $5 to support our campaign and movement to transform our politics?
Contribute $5 »
When Trump finally leaves the White House, one way or the other, we’ll need an army of strong, progressive leaders to address the damage Trump’s made and usher in a new era of change.
Together, we will write the next chapter in American politics and make sure we come out of this moment of crisis stronger and more united than ever.
That’s why Mondaire Jones is determined to bring his bold, progressive agenda to Congress and make sure that, even after Trump, our leaders act like leaders. He’s proudly supported issues like a Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and impeachment since day 1 of his campaign: there’s no doubt he’ll be just as fearless fighting for us in Congress.
But Mondaire can’t do this by himself: he needs a grassroots army at his side to make sure he can win this race and actually make it to Congress. Please chip in $5 now so Team Mondaire has the resources to spread our message and stay competitive.

6,"It’s been a difficult week to be black in America. I’d be lying if I said I haven’t cried often in between rallying for justice and campaigning for Congress.
Friend,
It’s been a difficult week to be black in America. I’d be lying if I said I haven’t cried often in between rallying for justice and campaigning for Congress.
Last week alone, a woman named Amy Cooper called the NYPD and lied about an “African-American man” threatening her life in Central Park. In actuality, that man had simply asked Ms. Cooper to leash her dog, which would have brought her into compliance with a well-publicized rule. In Louisville, Kentucky, protests intensified over the shooting death by police officers in March of an unarmed black woman named Breonna Taylor, whose home police officers barged into shortly after midnight in search of two men believed to be selling drugs. And on May 28th, a horrific video surfaced showing Derek Chauvin, an officer with the Minneapolis Police Department, slowly murder in broad daylight an unarmed black man, George Floyd, as other officers stood by and did nothing.
Black Americans like me are constantly retraumatized by these stories and images. We are tired of having to march, protest, and riot to get justice from governments whose job it is to deliver it. And we are tired of watching police officers brutalize and kill us with impunity.
But we know these problems run much deeper than police violence. Institutional racism is everywhere.
Institutional racism pervades our criminal legal system. Black people are arrested at disproportionately high rates, including in New York’s 17th Congressional District. Black people are more likely to be prosecuted than white people who are arrested for the same crimes. And black people are sentenced more harshly than white people convicted for the same crimes.
Institutional racism is also present throughout our economic system. The net worth of the average white household is 10 times that of the average black household. Black people are less likely to grow up in school districts with quality public schools, and more likely to graduate college with significant student debt. Black people are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured, and more likely to contract -- and die from -- preventable ailments like diabetes and asthma. Black people are more likely to experience homelessness or live in homes that endanger their health, and less likely to have access to public transit.
The protests we are seeing are not just about George Floyd. They are not even just about police killings. They are an expression of deep frustration with systems and leadership that shortchange black people, and a government that is at best indifferent to our plight.
Weeks like this redouble my commitment to change that reality.
In NY-17, I am humbled to fight alongside thousands of people of all ages, orientations, genders, colors, economic backgrounds, and creeds, to advance the cause of racial justice. As I watch my opponents scramble to add criminal justice reform -- something I have called for since the moment I entered this race -- to their platforms, or suddenly co-sponsor a policing reform bill that has been sitting before their state legislative bodies for years, I am reminded that we desperately need people in office who do not need nationwide protests to treat racial injustice with urgency. Black people shouldn’t have to take to the streets for our elected officials to lift the boot off of our throats. That’s why we need people in office for whom policy is personal.
The problems we face are human-made, and they can be solved. A better world can be ours if we fight for it. Together, we are going to bring the change this district and our country so desperately need.
In solidarity,
Mondaire

7,"And stop asking the military to police. My op-ed ➡
Friends and neighbors,
In my op-ed published yesterday by WBUR's Cognoscenti, I argue that after September 11th, government at all levels — federal, state, local — increasingly flipped the idea of policing on its head. State and local police were given more military and intelligence capabilities, while troops overseas were tasked with policing foreign soil.
As a former platoon commander in Afghanistan, and as the current chair of the public safety committee for the Newton City Council, I understand how these challenges are interwoven. As your next member of Congress, I'll work to tackle both.
Read my full op-ed below (and share).
Onwards,
Jake
After 9/11, Policing Underwent Radical Change. It’s Time To Course Correct
Contrary to the president’s claims, the protests of the last weeks have been overwhelmingly peaceful. Yet, we see the tools of war on our streets. Police and the National Guard patrol with the weapons and armor that I recognize from my overseas deployments in the Marines.
We must demilitarize the police. To do this, we must shift the paradigm of public safety, at home and abroad.
After September 11th, government at all levels — federal, state, local — increasingly flipped the idea of policing on its head. State and local police were given more military and intelligence capabilities, while troops overseas were tasked with policing foreign soil.
The new Department of Homeland Security became a bridge between the two. From airports to subways to street corners, our everyday experience became marked by lurking threats that required overwhelming force. We were all deputized to ""say something,"" if we ""see something.""
Conversely, our troops are deployed as police. That includes me. As an infantry platoon commander in Helmand Province, my mission was to patrol three villages subject to Taliban influence. In tandem with the Afghan police, we tried to establish rapport with tribal elders, to root out Taliban abettors and to generally underwrite security. Marines are expeditionary — we are meant to take on unfamiliar missions. But we are not police.
Our military is policing villages that are not their own, and our police are empowered to act with military force. These twin failed initiatives must stop: get the military and intelligence services out of our public square here at home, and stop using our military as a police force overseas. As monumental as ending the forever wars would be, it is the former — the demilitarization of police — that will be the harder call to action.
Each city and town can begin by looking at dispatches and details. How often are cops being asked to control traffic? Cite noise violators? Handle substance abuse? And, how often would recourse to force have been necessary to protect public safety?
As the chair of the public safety and transportation committee on the Newton City Council, I am helping to steer that review for my hometown. I expect we'll find that we're asking police to not just keep us safe from violent crime, but also to handle every other assignment that has rolled downhill from law to enforcement, without due consideration for the right agent to enforce.
In some cases, it's already obvious it's not working. For example: Newton police are being called on landscapers whose leaf blowers are too loud. By expanding the surface area of police-citizen contact into these types of non-threatening situations, we increase the likelihood of violence — especially violence predicated on racial profiling.
Race must be at the center of this review. Collecting data on policing and racism should become a national project, but we can’t let this be a statistics discussion when Black and brown voices on the subject have been clear for centuries: our fellow Americans do not trust law enforcement. As a white man, I feel safer when cops are nearby. Many of my Black and brown constituents do not, and for good reason.
Ending the 9/11 mindset, and reviewing police functions through the lens of racial justice, will be good for both citizens and police. To be sure, we need a public safety arm that can use force to protect people — nobody wants to dial 911 during a robbery and get a ringtone. But we have taken the right of government to use force and spread it across domains where force is rarely helpful.
I’m proud that we’re starting this conversation in my hometown’s City Hall, along with cities and towns throughout the United States. To complete it, though, will take action from Washington, too. Stop militarizing the police. And stop asking the military to police other peoples. From my patrol base in Helmand to my chair at the public safety committee, I know we can do better.

8,"Hey,
If you weren't paying attention to the GOP Convention speaker list, here's one you need to know: Matt Gaetz.
Tonight, on a national stage, Gaetz will sing Trump's praises -- in spite of every crisis Trump created for us, every occasion he utterly failed to rise to, and every burden he put on the backs of the American people.
There's no telling what Gaetz will say exactly, but we'd wager it'll be divisive, tone-deaf, ignorant, self-promotional, and so boastful you'll want to throw your television straight into the garbage.
What Gaetz should be doing, instead of soaking up the limelight, is working with partners in the Senate to deliver relief for communities suffering from the coronavirus. He should be holding Trump accountable for his crimes. He should be apologizing for failing to serve our district with the honor and integrity we deserve.
Let's make this the first and last time we see Gaetz speaking as a congressman at the GOP Convention. Chip in $5 or more now to return honor and integrity to Florida's 1st by electing Phil Ehr to Congress.

9,"NEW POLL: 43% vs. 44%
Hey,
This poll is exactly what we were hoping for.
Floridians have been watching Gaetz spend his time in office sucking up to Donald Trump, providing cover for his crimes and lies, and promoting himself on cable news.
But voters realize that it's not Matt's time he's wasting -- it's our time. Time that could be spent protecting our coastline from pollution, time that could be spent fixing our broken health care system, time that could be spent empowering working families.
We know because only 43% of poll respondents said they'd vote to re-elect Gaetz. And 44% said they're considering voting for someone else or will confidently vote to replace him.
Floridians are done letting Gaetz waste any more of our precious time. This November, we'll elect Phil Ehr to Congress where he'll fight for working families and uphold our shared values.
We can defeat Matt Gaetz and return honor and integrity to Congress -- but we can't do it without your help. Chip in $5 or more now and tell Matt Gaetz his time is up!

10,"Friend,
Right now, our nation faces one of its greatest threats ever -- a crisis of leadership.
Everyday Matt Gaetz and Donald Trump work to sow doubt in the American system, divide us along party lines, and create chaos in order to cover up their crimes and stay in power.
They’re waging a war on the very people they’re supposed to serve.
During my 26-year military career I watched the enemy use these tactics, but never thought I’d see the day when American leaders would use it against their own people.
But, the tide is turning. Americans nationwide are yearning for an end to the chaos and division. They want real leadership.
That’s why I’m running.
Tomorrow our historic campaign will release our most powerful ad to date. When people see our new ad, they’ll know the change our nation so desperately needs has arrived.
But, because we are not funded by big corporations and the 1% like my opponent, we rely on grassroots donors like you -- so please chip in what you can to help us reach as many voters as possible with our new ad.

11,"Hello --
I'm happy to share that, thanks to the unwavering commitment of our volunteers, the hard work of my team, and the incredible support of grassroots donors:
I'm officially your 2020 Democratic nominee to replace Matt Gaetz.
When I set out to defeat Matt Gaetz and restore honor and integrity to Congress, I knew it would be a tough mission. Because Matt's proven himself a master of self-promotion and has done a great job to make sure all eyes are on him.
But there's a downside to this strategy: Every time Gaetz decides to shirk his constitutional duties or defend Trump from crimes or crisis -- each and every one of us is watching him do it.
What we've seen is nothing short of vile and morally bankrupt.
He caused a political spectacle by charging doors during impeachment proceedings. He threatened witnesses via Twitter. And he downplayed the dangers of the coronavirus on the House floor.
The time for change is now, team. We can give Gaetz the boot and finally lead our district with the honor and integrity we deserve.
But if we're going to take this fight all the way to Washington, I need to continue leaning on your strength. We've only got 76 days left in the general election to put in the work and retire Matt Gaetz. If you're with me, chip in $5 or more now to help do it.

Hi Alex,
My name is Bill Olson, and I am a conservative Christian combat vet running to take back a Swing district - Florida’s 9th District, currently held by liberal Democrat Darren Soto.
As a decorated U.S. Army vet who saw combat in the Middle East, my country- and our freedoms- mean something to me!
Along the way, I was recognized for my service: four Army Achievement Medals, the Army Commendation Medal, and two Meritorious Service Medals.
I also received an additional Army Commendation Medal for my meritorious service in liberating Kuwait during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, and in 2008 I was awarded the Bronze Star for exceptionally meritorious service during the global war on terror in Afghanistan.
So you can imagine, being an Army lifer, that serving my country - protecting my country and our freedoms - is a VERY big deal to me!
That said, what I am MOST proud of, is that my passion for serving my country was passed on to my three sons.
I am NOT a career politician…. Just someone who spent most of his adult life, risking my life for your freedom.
here is nothing I’d rather do - I’m a fighter and I love my country and my fellow citizens!
Now I want to take that fighting spirit to Congress- and Nancy Pelosi and her band of Socialists don’t stand a chance.
I’m running against a career politician: Democrat Darren Soto.
I need your help today \- to replace Darren Soto, stop the radicals in Congress, stop impeachment and win Florida for the Republicans! Can you help me?
Liberal Democrat Darren Soto did not serve in the military. Instead, he votes with AOC and her anti-American ""Squad"" over 95% of the time!
I think those who have laid the most on the line for our country and its citizens- whose who have taken an Oath to defend the Constitution- are the ones best fit to defend our Constitution in Congress.
I always knew Darren Soto was bad, but when the Conservative Review Liberty Scorecards came out, we found out just how bad...
Darren Soto got 17% for the last Congress- an ""F"" rating.
His score is nearly identical to Speaker Pelosi, because Soto is Nancy Pelosi's lap dog - he sold his voting card to her a long time ago!
Soto votes every time to fund Planned Parenthood.
He votes for gun control - every time.
What really upsets me is that Soto's Democrats went all-in on impeaching the President. They have become SO radicalized, they impeached the President for nothing more than political payback!
Time for that to stop!
Me, I’m not a career politician. I don't have a fancy family pedigree.
I earned my education in the Cold War frontiers of Germany and South Korea, as well as the battlefields of Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan. That's why I'm 100% behind the President's ""America First"" policies!
I’m running to fight for American greatness, American peace, and American pride.
I am a Christian conservative. I believe that when you swear an oath to defend the Constitution, that oath has no expiration date!
Impeachment was never supposed to be a method of resolving our political disputes. It's supposed to be a rare way to remove a President who has committed high crimes.
President Trump is innocent! And he is a great President and a great American. We must defend him and re-elect him!
This isn't what the Constitution envisioned. This sad spectacle of partisan revenge is not what America is!
President Trump is innocent! We need to make sure the crazy Democrats pay dearly for what they are doing. And we do that at the ballot box!
And for that, Florida will be key.
In 2016, President Trump won by expanding the field, winning in places Republicans hadn't won lately.
The Democrats in 2020 are trying to return the favor- trying to win in Florida.
Let's be clear - there is NO Republican win in 2020 without Florida.
Florida is so pivotal. The electoral votes, along with so many Republican-leaning and swing congressional districts, make this state of paramount importance.
Plus, it's now President Trump's home state!
People here have no tolerance for the Dems' impeachment scam. They have no tolerance for the crazy policies and socialism.
We are red-blooded Americans! Democrats like AOC and her extremism have no place here.
Me? I'm a working class guy who loves God and my country. I'm 100% behind the President's ""America First"" policies!
Perhaps you agree with me, that we need more Bible, more Constitution - and less crazy liberal Democrats like Darren Soto.
If so, then I need your help!
Darren Soto will have all of Nancy Pelosi's Swamp money. That's why I need your help today- to replace Darren Soto, and support the President!
Can you help me?
I need to raise $23,500 before the end of this month to let the people of Central Florida know about Soto's liberal record.
Can I count on you for a donation of $25, $50, $100, $250, $500, $1000.... all the way to the Federal maximum donation of $2800 per individual, $5600 per couple?
The Democrats are going to lose next year \- but only if we let the American people know what they have done. It's up to us!
Let's get this done!

Hi Alex,
My name is Bill Olson, and I am a conservative Christian combat vet running to take back Florida’s competitive 9th District, currently held by Socialist Democrat Darren Soto. And I need your help to be YOUR champion in Congress!
I am a Christian. As a Christian, we are taught to love, even your enemies.
That is why I don't understand the blind hatred the Democrats seem to have these days- against our country, against our history, against our very citizens!
Consider the actions of the Dems just in the last few weeks:
-Tearing down historical statues, even when it's illegal to do so. In Portland, mobs tore down statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson; in Richmond, Governor ""Radical Ralph"" Northam has torn down many statues along the city's famous Monument Ave. The DNC even came out swinging against historic Mt. Rushmore! It clearly doesn't matter if they are confederate statues or not; it's America they hate!
-Abolishing the police, depriving citizens of needed protection against violent crime. Look at what Joe Biden has now embraced:
It's clear Joe Biden's far left advisers are starting to change his stance on policing in America.
During an interview Wednesday with leftist publication This Now, Biden said the police are over militarized, have ""become the enemy"" and said funding should ""absolutely"" be reallocated elsewhere. In other words, he's advocating for the defunding of law enforcement as crime across the country continues to skyrocket.
-Depriving us of our Constitutionally-guaranteed rights, including our freedom of speech and freedom to worship.
The U.S. Constitution is also being tested in unprecedented ways, with religious leaders from Mississippi to Kentucky to San Diego County suing their governments, asserting that they are being treated differently from businesses that can remain open, such as supermarkets and liquor stores.
What is most disturbing is that the Supreme Court has backed California's restrictions on Freedom of Worship.
-Condoning violence by mobs.
House Democrats unanimously blocked a resolution condemning acts of violence and rioting—including the ""deliberate targeting of law enforcement officers""—in the wake of George Floyd's death.
The resolution, which was introduced by Rep. Greg Steube (R., Fla.) late Thursday morning, condemned Floyd's killing at the hands of police, calling it ""inconsistent with the values and conduct expected of law enforcement officers."" The resolution also supported peaceful protesters, but it noted that protests have been ""exploited by violent extremists"" carrying out ""acts of violence, looting, destruction of business and personal property, and additional loss of life.""
Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio) spoke in favor of the resolution, arguing that while Floyd's death was ""wrong as wrong could be,"" there is a ""big difference between peaceful protest and rioting."" Jordan also spoke against defunding the police, calling it ""one of the craziest public policy proposals I have ever seen.""
Image
It is now clear that the Democrats, including my opponent Darren Soto, have been swept away by extremism, with the most fringe Stalinist parts of their base now driving the party's agenda. These ain't Kennedy's Democrats- they have more in common with Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communists!
Image
I fought for our country in Iraq and Afghanistan. My sons and I have served our country for decades- and when you take the oath to defend the Constitution, it has no expiration date!
I will defend our country and our Constitution against the Democrats' anti-American extremism. Will you stand with me?
Our district now knows that there is a better way forward- one which does not include overthrowing the Constitution and the entire American system- as Ilhan Omar now advocates:
Rep. Ilhan Omar says America is a giant “system of oppression” needing an immediate “dismantling” far beyond current calls for criminal justice reform.
“We can’t stop at criminal justice reform or policing reform,” she said during an outdoor press conference. “We are not merely fighting to tear down the systems of oppression in the criminal justice system. We are fighting to tear down systems of oppression that exist in housing, in education, in health care, in employment, [and] in the air we breathe.”
Image
It's hard to believe, but this kind of Communist Revolution is now what the Dems, led by AOC and Ilhan Omar, advocate. That's why it's important to stand up for America- right now!
Now, I'm not a slick fundraiser or polished politician. I'm don't have Pelosi's Swampy millions, which is why I need your help!
I need your help today- to replace Darren Soto, defend America and support the President!
I need your help to stand up for the Constitution and against Communism!
Can you help me? Florida is SO important for the Republicans. It's now the President's hme state, with many swing districts like mine!
Can I count on you for a donation of $15, $35, $60, $250, $500, $1000.... all the way to the Federal maximum donation of $2800 per individual, $5600 per couple?
I appreciate whatever you can send so we can defeat socialist Darren Soto!
I'm going to make sure the radical Democrats lose BIG this year \- with your help!

17,"ಠ_ಠ Pelosi says she's not ಠ_ಠ
Alex,
Last weekend, supporters of our campaign posted more than 200,000 tweets on #PelosiMustGo, pushing it to the #1 trending position on Twitter for over 12 hours! Our campaign gained 5,000 new followers in the course of a day!
That’s phenomenal, but we’re not stopping there. We’re continuing to spread the word to everyone, both nationwide and here in San Francisco.
When the hashtag was trending, we took a poll to find out why more and more voters want her gone. Here’s what we learned:
She’s “not a big fan” of Medicare for All. Pelosi used these exact words. She doesn’t support it, and never will, because her allies receive huge contributions from the pharmaceutical & health insurance industries. Even during this pandemic, her advice was to “hydrate and pray.” That’s not much help to the 138,000 Americans who’ve already died from COVID-19.
CHIP IN TODAY SO WE CAN 🥤🥤🥤HYDRATE AND PRAY🙏🙏🙏
Her game show politics don’t help working people. Pelosi dressed in African kente cloth, but forgot George Floyd’s name and fell far short of community demands to defund the police and invest in more effective alternatives to secure public safety. She ripped up Trump’s State of the Union speech, but supported his obscene military budget, expanded his surveillance powers, and approved his corporate bailout plans. Asked about her response to the pandemic, Pelosi talked not about working people who need universal paid sick leave, or rent relief—neither of which she supports—but about her gourmet ice cream collection. Like Trump, she’s basically a reality TV star who governs by theater rather than substance, with predictably bad results.
She’s a real estate tycoon who doesn’t speak for SF. Pelosi has something else in common with Trump: both of them are real estate tycoons born with silver spoons in their mouths to powerful east coast families. Pelosi and her husband are owners of multiple mansions and hotels, worth over $100 million, and investors in many other commercial properties, including one that received a PPP government loan of $1 million. They’ve also participated in select (not publicly available) investment opportunities while Nancy passed laws favoring enterprises in which they’ve invested.
She never stands up to Trump’s bad budgets. Whether it’s his bloated war allotments, his bailouts and tax breaks for billionaires and corporations, or his expansion of spying on U.S. citizens, Nancy Pelosi has come through for our criminal president time after time. And while she likes to brag about having impeached him, she limited the process to the weakest possible case—effectively excusing all of his worst crimes, including his corruption, which has sparked bipartisan concerns and could have removed him from the White House.
We’re doing what no one thought we could, and forcing Pelosi to abandon her long-established positions to support policies she never has before. We’re winning against all odds, but we can’t win in November without you. Can you make a contribution today so we can send Pelosi packing?
She’s waffled on Black Lives Matter and Defunding the Police. Not only has Nancy Pelosi stated she’s against defunding the police (which Minneapolis has already done), but her police reform bill was 10 years behind the times, filled with no-brainers like a chokehold ban, which should have become federal policy back in the Rodney King days. It’s not good enough, and falls short of community demands to defund police. In fact, Pelosi’s latest proposal would further expand police budgets!
But enough about Nancy Pelosi.
I want to sincerely thank you for all your efforts. With your help, we’re spreading the word that after 33 years of blocking change and enabling the GOP, Pelosi must finally go.
We’re happy to help make it happen, alongside you.
Thanks for your support,
Shahid

Alex,
Today we have big news out of San Francisco: District Attorney Chesa Boudin has ended the use of cash bail in all criminal cases!
Previously, when people were arrested in a criminal case they were held in jail until their trial unless they could they could provide “cash bail”—a large amount of money—to the court. The money is later returned if the defendant appears at all their court dates, though this can be weeks or even months later.
This system unfairly targeted low income people whose families are less likely to have cash on-hand. This means that low income defendants who have not been convicted of a crime were held in jail longer than their wealthy peers and lose their job or worse.
Today’s news is an example of how quickly we can make change when we elect progressive candidates. Can you chip in $15 to help us get to Congress today?

Ending cash bail was one of Chesa’s campaign promises, and one of the many reasons I endorsed and campaigned alongside him.
The more progressives we elect to office the more we can accomplish.
Bernie Sanders spoke out in support of Chesa Boudin’s decision today and of ending cash bail nationwide. In order to accomplish this, it’s critical that we not only elect Bernie as President but that we elect a progressive congress ready to support his agenda.
It’s all up to you. Chip in $15 today!

19,"Trump’s escalation risks a war we can neither afford nor justify.
Alex,
Yesterday, news emerged that our criminal President authorized the assassination of Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani. We stand at the brink of a conflict that our country can neither justify nor afford.
Can you stand with us as we challenge this latest military escalation?
Assassinating a foreign leader is an act of war. Journalists have compared the act to the assassination of either the U.S. Vice President or a high-ranking military general.
Trump’s actions are irresponsible. Equally irresponsible, however, were the congressional leaders who just approved his $738 billion defense funding request.
Speaker Pelosi bears particular responsibility.
Not only did Pelosi oppose—and successfully defeat—two proposed amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act that would have prevented Trump’s escalation, but she continues to impose House rules that deny House Members access to classified secrets.
In other words, Speaker Pelosi actively supports executive secrecy and unilateralism, even while pursuing a late, limited, and ultimately theatrical impeachment process that failed to address the President’s worse crimes against our Republic.
Would you rather see San Francisco represented in Washington by a voice promoting peace and accountability?
Trump failed to ask for permission from Congress before committing an act of war that he is constitutionally not authorized to initiate. And, strikingly, no one seems to be asking how we plan to pay for yet another war of aggression.
But militarism is reprehensible for other reasons. It is reprehensible because it diverts public resources from social needs like healthcare and affordable housing. It is reprehensible because it consumes human lives. It is especially reprehensible because it is often bipartisan.
We’ve been down this road before. After Bush’s invasion of Iraq, a million civilians died, alongside 4,500 U.S. troops. Another 32,000 were wounded and will never be the same. In Afghanistan, 2,500 U.S. troops died while another 20,500 have been wounded. Over 100,000 Afghans have died.
This morning, Speaker Pelosi wrote that “American leaders’ highest priority is to protect American lives and interests.” But protecting American (usually, corporate) “interests” has cost the lives of too many Americans, and far more civilians from other countries.
Now, more than ever, we must say “no” to war, and take action to challenge militarism. We deserve leaders and representatives who will stand with us.
I've been arrested participating in direct action to stop a war. I've organized mass demonstrations to pull the plug on a corporate invasion. Today, we’ll be joining a demonstration at Powell & Market from noon until 2pm, and invite you to join us there.
In Congress, I'll continue to wage peace. My experience uniquely situates me to enter Congress as an agent of change.
Will you stand with me—and with global peace & justice—today?

20,"Alex,
When I saw that House Democrats were passing something called the “Justice in Policing Act,” I have to admit that just for a moment, I thought that in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, and millions of Black Lives Matter activists in the streets, they’d finally done something right.
I wish!
This Pelosi-endorsed bill would require federal police to wear body cameras, and also includes funding for local cops to do the same. While that might sound good, it’s actually a slap in the face to both justice and privacy. Here’s why:
We need major limits on the role of police in our society, not body cams or baby steps. Can you contribute to unseating Pelosi and breaking the establishment’s chokehold on justice?
* Body cams only provide recordings of isolated incidents, not patterns of violent behavior, so they can’t help weed out abusive cops
* Body cams don’t record cops themselves, only what they see—so they rarely offer evidence of widespread police violence & brutality captured by broader angles, such as those captured by dashboard cameras or third party videos.
* A recent study shows that body cams don’t reduce crime, don’t improve police accountability, and are mostly used against citizens, not violent police
* Finally, in our estimation, body cams, which again record only citizens and not police, are a huge violation of Fourth Amendment privacy rights
I’m proud to have fought for decades on the front lines of the civil rights and justice reform movements. Believe me when I say that the so-called Justice in Policing Act is a 10-year-old solution to a modern problem. That solution might have been barely adequate then, but not now.
What we need now, and what Minneapolis is already doing, is to significantly defund the police and redistribute that funding to social work, mental health services, and community programs—while also actively demilitarizing the police so they look like the people they’re serving, not storm troopers straight out of STAR WARS.
Can you chip in and help us win, so the true justice reform we’ve advocated for decades—and that other prominent voices agree with—can finally become a reality?

21,"When Donald Trump ordered the deployment of chemical weapons to clear protesters in order to get a photo op of himself holding up a Bible, what was Pelosi’s response?
Alex,
Black people have been subjugated in our country since even before our Republic was founded. That’s why saying “Black Lives Matter” is important—and actually doing something about it, even more so.
Yet when asked, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has never been able to bring herself to say the phrase without adding that “all lives matter.” That might seem innocuous, but carries disturbing implications under the circumstances, overlooking centuries of racial oppression.
Pelosi hasn’t been up to the task. Protests challenging police brutality have made that crystal clear. She mouths concern for racial justice, having spent 30 years undermining it.
I’ve spent the last 20 years advancing racial justice, from the streets to courtrooms and the halls of Congress, as a national advocate for civil rights and civil liberties. Can you support our campaign to take those concerns to the House?
Earlier today, I shared some thoughts about the uprising that we are witnessing together around the country.

When Donald Trump ordered the deployment of chemical weapons to clear protesters in order to get a photo op of himself holding up a Bible, what was Pelosi’s response?
Outrage?
A bill to demilitarize police?
She held up a second Bible and encouraged our criminal president to change his ways.
My take is vastly different.
I’m here for real justice backed up by the force of law, and I’ve taken action on those convictions for years—from organizing dozens of direct action events to writing dozens of articles, leading national non-profits, and pioneering courtroom battles to expand civil rights.
I was proud to stand with our neighbors in Oakland this weekend.

Our campaign proposes a 20-point platform to transform criminal justice that covers profiling, police militarization, ending the drug war, cutting mandatory minimum sentences, restricting deadly force, prohibiting cash bail, ending qualified immunity to support the prosecution of cops who kill, providing multiple paths for at-risk youth, and much more.
Meanwhile, Pelosi offers platitudes and empty rhetoric.
Can you help us take a big step toward real justice reform by replacing the leading corporate Democrat with a civil rights champion?
We’re serious about replacing Nancy Pelosi. And I’m equally serious about making America an equitable, just, inclusive and fair, safe place for Black Americans. As an immigrant of color, I understand how institutions prey on vulnerable communities, including black people, immigrants, and people of color.
I’m running for Congress to do everything I can to help. Thank you for standing with me!

Shahid

We’re up against a candidate whose record proves he’s not in this fight for the families of our community -- and we must fight back.
Troy Nehls is a former police officer with a long record of misconduct, from being discharged for mishandling evidence to lying about being charged with a crime in a sworn statement. He’s attacked survivors of sex trafficking and downplayed and denied the existence of coronavirus even as his own employeers got sick -- and he’s proven eager to become a mouthpiece of Washington special interests and gut health care for millions of families across this state.
Sri Preston Kulkarni is a lifelong public servant and diplomat who knows firsthand what it’s like to nearly go broke from our broken health care system. He’s in this fight to stand for working families in our district and expand access to affordable care, not gut it.

23,"Team,
I wanted to follow up on the email my campaign manager Allen sent to you recently.
Not only is my Republican opponent, Kathaleen Wall’s pay-to-play attitude all wrong for Texas -- her rhetoric is even worse.
In just the last month Wall:
* Thanked the coronavirus “for saving lives”, because it created an excuse for Governor Greg Abbott to shutter Planned Parenthood and other reproductive health clinics in Texas.
* Released a dangerous ad attacking Chinese Americans for COVID-19 at a time when hate crimes against our AAPI community are already on the rise.
These statements from Wall aren’t just outrageous, team. They’re dangerous and disregard the safety and well-being of some of our most vulnerable residents.
Scapegoating Asian Americans and celebrating the governor’s attempts to block women from exercising their right to make their own health care choices is no way to campaign -- and it’s no way to govern.
I know times are tough right now, but if you’re able to give a donation to our team to help us defeat Kathaleen Wall and her attempt to buy this election, we would be incredibly grateful.
Thank you,
-Sri

With millions of dollars in personal checks and a small-dollar donor rate of less than 0.0%, Wall is running a pay-to-play campaign to get her into Congress.
Wall is just another mega-donor looking to buy influence and protect her own special interests. Her campaign isn’t about helping everyday Texans -- it’s about power and prestige.

24,"History repeats itself, until we decide to make history.
Dear Friend,
His list of crimes is long: corrupt use of his appointment power, pardons, and veto powers, corrupt disposal of public lands and interference with elections.
He repeatedly ignored Congress and claimed more power for himself under the Constitution. Despite this blatant ""usurpation of power"" as one representative put it, he had enough Senators in his pocket to acquit him when impeached.
""History repeats itself"" might sound like a cliche, but it is true. And we aren't talking about Trump, we are going further back to 1868. These were some of the many charges leveled against then President Andrew Johnson.
Johnson set our country's progress back during the critical time known as Reconstruction. But it was at precisely this time that Congress was able to pass the Tenure of Office Act,, and the 14th and 15th amendments. Like Johnson, Trump is suffering defeats at the Supreme Court too, just as Trump has done recently, on DACA, abortion restrictions and LGBTQ rights.
Important victories, to be sure, but there is so much more we need to accomplish.
That is why I am writing to you today. We KNOW Trump and Republicans are worried about losing control. NOW is the time to get to work to flip the Texas State House with five winnable seats right here in Tarrant County!
History repeats itself, until we decide to make history.

Folks,
Today is Juneteenth -- the day we commemorate the ending of legal slavery in Texas when men and women in Galveston received the news of their freedom, almost two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed.
We know the end of slavery did not translate into full equality. Institutionalized racism, discrimination and hate crimes are far too commonplace in America.
Still to this day, racism is impacting every aspect of our society. From the criminal justice system to employment, black men and women are still striving to achieve true equality.
We still have so much further to go.

Fellow Conservative,
I'm sure you're disgusted to witness the devastation of Democrat-run cities as crime and violence spike to record levels under the mob rule of Antifa and violent rioters.
And as Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and their far-Left party cheer-on mass rioting and looting across the country, I know you agree that the soul of America is at stake in 2020.
That's why we're emailing you to make an urgent request:
Will you donate $25, $50 or more so that we can continue stand with President Trump and fight the far-Left socialists in this pivotal election?
So, your generous donation today will also give a critical push in this crucial final month before the election.

> ""[[URL REDACTED]] Republican Party is the pro-America party, and President Donald J. Trump is the pro-America candidate.""
We've been defending President Trump from the never-ending onslaught of attacks, including:
* An insane, fake-news fueled Russia-collusion hoax,
* Robert Mueller's taxpayer-funded ""investigation"", and
* Adam Schiff and the Dem's despicable impeachment sham!
We CANNOT allow these far-left radicals to win in November!
Will you join our fight to defend conservative values and the United States Constitution by making your best gift of $25, $50 or more?
If Republicans lose in November, conservatives like you and me won't be able to stop the far-left from radically transforming America into a socialist nation with their radical plans to:
* Defund the police
* Defund Border Patrol
* Defund our Military!
Unlike Joe Biden and his far-Left pals, we are proud of America's founding conservative principles that created the greatest, most prosperous nation in human history.
So, please join the fight for our cherished conservative values by supporting my re-election with the most generous contribution you can afford.

Fellow Conservative,
I'm sure you're disgusted to witness the devastation of Democrat-run cities as crime and violence spike to record levels under the mob rule of Antifa and violent rioters.
And as Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and their far-Left party cheer-on mass rioting and looting across the country, I know you agree that the soul of America is at stake in 2020.
That's why we're emailing you to make an urgent request:
Will you donate $25, $50 or more so that we can continue stand with President Trump and fight the far-Left socialists in this pivotal election?
So, your generous donation today will also give a critical push in this crucial final month before the election.
In case you missed my speech at the Republican National Convention, I said,
> ""[[URL REDACTED]] Republican Party is the pro-America party, and President Donald J. Trump is the pro-America candidate.""
We've been defending President Trump from the never-ending onslaught of attacks, including:
* An insane, fake-news fueled Russia-collusion hoax,
* Robert Mueller's taxpayer-funded ""investigation"", and
* Adam Schiff and the Dem's despicable impeachment sham!

Dear Fellow Conservative,
With Election Day just a few weeks away, my team just released our first television ad today. I hope you can take a minute to watch it here and  chip in a few bucks to help us keep it running
Our message is clear:
Conservatives stand together for law enforcement, family values, and our second amendment rights.
Democrats’ stand with rioters, looters, and ANTIFA members who want to destroy our nation’s cities and monuments. Democrats solution to the crime and chaos in our cities is to defund the police, ease our border control, and decrease funding for our military.
This is not what we stand for. We stand together, united, for our great nation’s principles, values, and institutions.
Take a moment to chip in today and show us that you stand together with us as we take on the radical left and continue to work toward victory in November.
Thank you for your support as we push toward VICTORY in November.
For freedom,
Jim Jordan

While the media is more than happy to excuse and forget Democratic blunders and failures, I haven’t forgotten.
Fellow Conservative,
This election is about your future, and it’s critical to paint a full picture of the records of Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
While the media is more than happy to excuse and forget Democratic blunders and failures, I haven’t forgotten.
* It was Joe Biden who said that if a black man didn’t vote for him, he wasn’t truly black.
* It was Joe Biden who said that black people are a monolithic community.
* It was Joe Biden who said, in all earnestness, that poor kids are just as smart as white kids.
And while his words are one thing, Joe Biden’s actions take it to a whole new level. It’s not surprising that his policies have hurt Americans of all colors and creeds.
In 1994, Biden led the charge on a crime bill that put millions of Black Americans behind bars. While this terrible policy was making things worse, two decades later President Trump’s criminal justice reform law fixed many disparities created by the 1994 crime bill.
Joe Biden has worked in Washington for 47 years, but he ignored our nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities all this time. In contrast, President Trump signed into law historically high funding for HBCUs, as well as a bill to give them permanent funding for the first time ever.
Fellow Conservative, will you stand with me to support the Republican ticket this November?
I take issue with the idea that African Americans should automatically vote for the Democrats every four years. You see, Democrats pay lip service to the Black community but have failed to deliver.
I am a proud Republican because we are the party dedicated to helping every American.
This election, I ask that you judge the candidates not by what they have said, but by what they have done.
Will you chip in to help Republicans continue their work for the American people?

Dear Fellow Conservative,
With Election Day just a few weeks away, my team just released our first television ad today. I hope you can take a minute to watch it here and  chip in a few bucks to help us keep it running
Our message is clear:
Conservatives stand together for law enforcement, family values, and our second amendment rights.
Democrats’ stand with rioters, looters, and ANTIFA members who want to destroy our nation’s cities and monuments. Democrats solution to the crime and chaos in our cities is to defund the police, ease our border control, and decrease funding for our military.
This is not what we stand for. We stand together, united, for our great nation’s principles, values, and institutions.
Take a moment to chip in today and show us that you stand together with us as we take on the radical left and continue to work toward victory in November.
Thank you for your support as we push toward VICTORY in November.
For freedom,
Jim Jordan

Democrats have been promising to impeach President Trump since before he was even inaugurated. Now, their cynical plan to forcibly remove the president from office faces a House vote, with the outcome already determined.
Send me to Washington to fight with Trump
That will send this ridiculous charade to the Senate, where my opponent Cory Booker has already made his bias clear.
Booker is hell bent on impeaching President Trump because Booker says he has done “things that are unacceptable.”

Jon doesn't have corporate PACs and federal lobbyists lining his campaign coffers like his opponent, David Perdue. We're relying on small-dollar, grassroots donations to power this campaign to victory.

The GOP is trying to make it more difficult for citizens to vote all across America -- and nowhere more than in Georgia. They've led efforts to purge hundreds of thousands of Georgians from voter rolls over the last few years.
They want you to wait in long lines. They want your polling place to be far away. They want you to be so dispirited and inconvenienced, you don't bother voting.
But friend, in spite of this historic voter suppression, something special is happening in Georgia.
Over 1.3 million Georgia voters have requested mail ballots -- nearly a quarter of whom didn't vote four years ago. Tens of thousands of Georgians have already voted. Just days ago, a state court rejected a GOP effort to purge 14,000 voters from voter rolls in Fulton County.

Voter suppression should be a crime.
As we speak, Georgia's election authorities are taking steps to make it harder for all eligible citizens to vote.
Here's the deal, friend: I am neck and neck in the polls with GOP Senator David Perdue, and this race is becoming the most competitive in the country.

Friend, nowhere is the fight against voter suppression more important than in my state of Georgia.
What happened during our June Primary -- with understaffed, overcrowded polling places with hours-long waits -- was an affront to the principles of our Constitution.
Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger administered an election that disproportionately disenfranchised Black and working-class voters.
And just last week, Raffensperger tried to convince DeKalb County not to send absentee ballot requests to all voters.
We cannot permit cynical politicians to abuse their power and disenfranchise American citizens.
They don't want us to be able to vote by mail. They want us to have to wait in long lines to exercise our right to vote. They want to discourage us. They want us to give up.
We won't give up. We are fighting back.
We're going to defy their voter suppression, win this election, and pass a new Voting Rights Act that will make voter suppression a federal crime.
Please, chip in $20 to our Voter Protection Fund. Friend, with just 12 weeks to go, we can't afford to wait.
Chip in $20 immediately >>
The struggle continues.

Corruption is ruining our democracy.
Breaking: Cook Political Report Shifts Georgia Senate Race Toward Democrats
Corrupt politicians and their corporate donors use the federal government to enrich themselves — while obstructing popular policies like a New Civil Rights Act, affordable health care for every American, and ambitious investments in infrastructure and clean energy!
It's time for a new generation of leadership to clean up this mess.
That's why Democrat Jon Ossoff is running for U.S. Senate to launch an all-out attack on political corruption.
And Jon's opponent, GOP Senator David Perdue, is as crooked as they come:
* He got caught selling meetings for corporate campaign cash and taking illegal corporate campaign contributions.
* He bought stock in a company that produces medical PPE the same day the Senate received a classified briefing on COVID-19, then dumped casino shares to buy vaccine stock while the pandemic bore down on America.
* He took campaign cash from the pharmaceutical industry and then voted against importing cheaper prescription drugs from Canada.
* He traded his stocks 300% more than usual while writing the largest emergency spending bill in American history!
And in the most recent polling Jon Ossoff is beating crooked Perdue by 2%!!
Over the past few months, the people of Georgia have seen Senator Perdue for what he is — a mindless Trump sycophant with no beliefs of his own, a corporate sellout, and a self-dealing influence peddler — the poster boy of Washington corruption.
Jon Ossoff has spent his career exposing corruption and the abuse of power — holding people like David Perdue accountable.
REMEMBER: Jon Ossoff runs a business renowned for its hard-hitting investigations of corruption, organized crime, and war crimes around the world!
Now Jon is running for the U.S. Senate to expose and defeat one of the most corrupt Senators in American history, and he's already leading in the polls.
This is the beginning of a new chapter in our country's history and the beginning of the end for corrupt politicians like David Perdue.
Express Donate $5
Defeating a corrupt Senator like David Perdue and his political machine will require a huge grassroots campaign.
And we're going to need help building it!!
So if you're able please chip in what you can right now so we can build a movement to defeat David Perdue and win back the Senate from his crony Mitch McConnell.

Friend -- Fighting corruption is Jon Ossoff's job.
Jon runs a business that investigates bribery, organized crime, and war crimes for news organizations worldwide. They've exposed corrupt officials, corporate abuses, contract killers, ISIS war crimes, and human traffickers.
Jon will bring that fight to the halls of Congress as the next Senator from Georgia.
We need anti-corruption reformers in Washington now more than ever, friend.
Investigating corruption is the focus of Jon's FIRST TV AD of the general election campaign: Watch it here >>
Watch: Jon's new ad on fighting corruption
Friend, we all know corruption is rampant in Washington. It's why politicians allow their Big Pharma donors to rip off our families and Big Oil donors to poison our air and water.
Jon's campaign isn't taking donations from corporate PACs or Congressional lobbyists.
Jon will be accountable exclusively to the people.
Right now, check out our new ad here >>

My opponent, David Perdue is as corrupt and out-of-touch as politicians come. Perdue is the caricature of Washington corruption.
This is a man who actually lives on a private island. He made a fortune as a CEO who bragged about shipping jobs overseas before his family’s political machine launched him to high office.
Since he was elected to the Senate, Perdue hasn’t once come down from that private island to answer for his votes or unethical conduct at a public town hall.
Perdue has taken more than a MILLION dollars from shady corporate PACs.
In fact, my opponent has taken so much money from corporate PACs that the Federal Election Commission said he violated federal law!
David Perdue serves only the president and his donors — not the people he represents.
We must defeat him in November.
David Perdue is vulnerable. Experts say he’s one of the most vulnerable Republicans in the entire Senate.
But he has a MASSIVE campaign warchest (full of all that corporate PAC money), and President Trump is repaying his loyalty with huge pay-for-access fundraisers. If we’re going to beat Perdue -- and help Democrats win back the Senate -- we can’t afford to miss a single deadline.

Sen. Perdue \(The COVID-19 stocks guy\) bragged about destroying American jobs for decades
Friend,
Jon Ossoff is running against a man who bragged about spending his ""entire career"" outsourcing American jobs, and said he was ""proud of it.""
GOP Sen. David Perdue bragged *under oath* that he made his fortune as a Fortune 500 executive shipping American jobs overseas, and that he was ""proud"" of it.
These days Sen. Perdue slaps on a red MAGA hat and pretends to stand up for American workers.
But Perdue is a phony and a hypocrite.
Perdue made his fortune outsourcing American jobs, exploiting corrupt trade deals and shipping jobs to Asia -- all to serve his shareholders on Wall Street.
But, this is classic David Perdue. Just look at his crooked conduct this year:
1. He bought stock in a company that produces medical PPE the same day the Senate received a classified briefing on COVID-19.
2. He traded his stocks 300% more than usual while writing the largest emergency spending bill in American history.
3. AND he was caught selling quarterly meetings to corporate PACs for $7,500 campaign checks.
Perdue's D.C. consultants will try to spin this -- but the people will see the plain truth:
David Perdue is THE poster boy of Washington corruption.
But Democrat Jon Ossoff is leading Perdue in the polls. Help Jon win >>
RUSH $5 TO GEORGIA NOW >>
Democrat Jon Ossoff runs a business that exposes corruption, organized crime, and war crimes.
Jon has dedicated his life to holding guys like David Perdue accountable.
And he can DEFEAT Perdue (the latest poll has Jon ahead by TWO POINTS!)
But Donald Trump Jr. is raising big money for Perdue now, and we need your grassroots support to stay competitive.
If you're able, can you chip in $5, $10, or whatever is possible right now?
We've set a huge end of the month fundraising goal of $50,000, and we need your help getting there.

Donald Trump Jr. is holding an event in Georgia in just a few hours!
The President's other son, Eric, visited the state yesterday.
Donald Trump and the Republicans are TERRIFIED of losing in Georgia, and they are going all out to stop the Democrats' momentum in this state.
Both Jon Ossoff and Joe Biden are surging in the polls here. Nothing is going to stop their momentum, friend.
Not the $35 MILLION Mitch McConnell and his allies are spending to stop Jon. And not Donald Trump sending his sons to Georgia.

They are terrified that Jon Ossoff and Joe Biden will win here and kick their dad and his enablers in Congress out of power.

Jon and Joe have all the momentum to win here and bring competent, compassionate leadership to Washington.
Friend, right now Jon is SURGING in the polls. That's why Mitch McConnell and his allies are spending $35 million to try to stop him.
They know if Jon wins his race here in Georgia, even if Donald Trump wins another term, he won't have a McConnell-led Senate to look the other way from his crimes and corruption.
Jon doesn't have corporate PACs and federal lobbyists lining his campaign coffers like his opponent, David Perdue. We're relying on small-dollar, grassroots donations to power this campaign to victory.

Corruption is ruining our democracy.
Breaking: Cook Political Report Shifts Georgia Senate Race Toward Democrats
Corrupt politicians and their corporate donors use the federal government to enrich themselves — while obstructing popular policies like a New Civil Rights Act, affordable health care for every American, and ambitious investments in infrastructure and clean energy!
It's time for a new generation of leadership to clean up this mess.
That's why Democrat Jon Ossoff is running for U.S. Senate to launch an all-out attack on political corruption.
And Jon's opponent, GOP Senator David Perdue, is as crooked as they come:
* He got caught selling meetings for corporate campaign cash and taking illegal corporate campaign contributions.
* He bought stock in a company that produces medical PPE the same day the Senate received a classified briefing on COVID-19, then dumped casino shares to buy vaccine stock while the pandemic bore down on America.
* He took campaign cash from the pharmaceutical industry and then voted against importing cheaper prescription drugs from Canada.
* He traded his stocks 300% more than usual while writing the largest emergency spending bill in American history!
And in the most recent polling Jon Ossoff is beating crooked Perdue by 2%!!
Over the past few months, the people of Georgia have seen Senator Perdue for what he is — a mindless Trump sycophant with no beliefs of his own, a corporate sellout, and a self-dealing influence peddler — the poster boy of Washington corruption.
Jon Ossoff has spent his career exposing corruption and the abuse of power — holding people like David Perdue accountable.
REMEMBER: Jon Ossoff runs a business renowned for its hard-hitting investigations of corruption, organized crime, and war crimes around the world!
Now Jon is running for the U.S. Senate to expose and defeat one of the most corrupt Senators in American history, and he's already leading in the polls.
This is the beginning of a new chapter in our country's history and the beginning of the end for corrupt politicians like David Perdue.
Express Donate $5
Defeating a corrupt Senator like David Perdue and his political machine will require a huge grassroots campaign.
And we're going to need help building it!!
So if you're able please chip in what you can right now so we can build a movement to defeat David Perdue and win back the Senate from his crony Mitch McConnell.

Friend,
Our nation is in crisis.
As I'm writing to you, amidst a public health emergency, President Trump is deploying unidentified federal troops to patrol our cities and snatch American citizens into unmarked vans on our streets.
We *must* win the White House and secure a majority in the U.S. Senate.
That's why today I'm urging you to join me in supporting my friend Jon Ossoff for U.S. Senate in Georgia.
Jon is an investigative journalist and media executive whose company has exposed bribery, human traffickers, war crimes, and corporate abuses.
I've gotten to know Jon over the last few years, and his passion for exposing corruption and the abuse of power is EXACTLY what's called for in the Senate today.
I want Jon Ossoff to fight alongside me in the U.S. Senate. So I'm asking you to help:
Send $5 so Jon Ossoff can WIN in Georgia
Since winning the Democratic nomination in a landslide, Jon has earned the endorsement of organizations like NARAL Pro-Choice America, Planned Parenthood, and the Human Rights Campaign.
Friend, they all know what I know: Jon Ossoff is a champion of the people who will stand up to corruption and the abuse of power.
Trump and Mitch McConnell know Jon is a threat. Republican super PACs have already committed more than $21 million to try to stop him. We need to show our grassroots power and equip Jon to hit back twice as hard.

Friend, it's long past time to end Mitch McConnell's reign in the Senate.
If Democrats win the Senate majority, we won't have to worry about another two years of extreme right-wing judges and disgraceful attempts to rip health care away from millions of Americans.
Instead, we will be able to make real progress on the issues that are important to us: making prescription drugs affordable, taking meaningful steps to combat the climate crisis, addressing police brutality, keeping our children safe from gun violence, and securing equal justice for all.
Georgia is a key battleground state and Jon is running to win one of the most flippable seats in the Senate. For Democrats to win a Senate majority, we have to win this seat.
And Jon has what it takes to win.
But only with your help, friend.

Folks, let's talk about Roe v. Wade.
This historic decision affirmed that women have a right to privacy when they make deeply personal health care decisions, and that the government must not infringe upon that autonomy.
This is about fundamental human rights.
And yet, Donald Trump will almost certainly nominate a Supreme Court justice committed to overturning Roe v. Wade and allowing politicians to intervene in women's health care.
The decision to terminate a pregnancy is a deeply personal one. It belongs to individual women, who know themselves and their own health -- not to politicians who would impose their personal views.
I run a business that investigates organized crime and corruption for news organizations worldwide, and we have investigated and exposed how dangerous, unqualified, and unregulated abortion providers kill thousands of women in places where safe abortion services are not available legally.
I will fight with every bone in my body to protect the privacy of women's health care in America, friend.
This is not about partisan politics -- it's about health, human rights, and privacy from government intrusion.
As Senator, I will only vote to confirm federal judges who pledge to uphold Roe v. Wade.
But I am running against a limitlessly-funded extremist who is so arrogant, he believes he is entitled to make these decisions for women in Georgia. If he is elected to another six-year term in the Senate, he will vote to confirm dozens of federal judges who will seize and destroy women's right to privacy in health care and to safe, legal abortion. Please help me win this race so I can fight to defend Roe v. Wade in the United States Senate.

You all know my friend Jon Ossoff as the inspiring young Democrat who broke turnout and grassroots fundraising records in the historic Special Election for Georgia's Sixth District three years ago.
Jon came up just a few thousand votes short in the most expensive Congressional race of all time -- and amidst suspicious destruction of election data -- after running a historic campaign that built a huge progressive infrastructure in Georgia.
You may not know that Jon is also a former Congressional national security aide who now works as a media executive and investigative journalist, and that Jon does amazing work exposing corruption, war crimes, and human rights abuses worldwide.
Jon leads a business that investigates powerful corporations, human traffickers, and other bad actors for major news organizations.
And when he worked in Washington, Jon made a name for himself on Capitol Hill by helping investigate mass surveillance of American citizens and malfeasance by federal contractors.
Friend, when it comes to fighting corruption, Jon Ossoff does not back down.
When I ran for Governor in 2018, Georgia voters saw corruption and the abuse of power up close -- a voting system that failed by design and disenfranchised countless Georgia voters.
Last week, we saw the same voting system fail us again, so we must work harder than ever to mobilize and protect voters so that Jon can win.
Friend, Jon Ossoff is currently leading his Republican opponent in the polls. But for Jon to win, we have to double down on our efforts to defend voting rights and ensure every vote is counted in Georgia.
So I'm asking you now: to defend our values, to deliver TWO U.S. Senate victories in Georgia and win the White House, to send a message that will echo through history, please join me in chipping into Jon's campaign TODAY:

Hey, I wanted to take a few minutes to explain exactly why I decided to run for Senate.
I hope you’ll read this email (I know it’s long) and then donate $5 to my campaign:
Donate >>
I lead a team of investigative journalists who have taken on ISIS war criminals, powerful corporations, human traffickers, and death squads. My teams often go undercover to expose crime and corruption around the world.
But you don’t need to go undercover to get a glimpse of the corruption in Washington. You just need to turn on the TV or visit the FEC website to see who, like my opponent David Perdue, is taking money from powerful industry groups and huge corporations. Then you can look at their voting records to see what that money bought!
* When the deck is stacked against working families while Wall Street banks, wealthy donors, and powerful trade groups receive lavish subsidies — that’s corruption.
* When the federal government silences its own environmental scientists because climate science threatens the powerful fossil fuel industry — that's corruption.
* When Congress won’t crack down on price gouging by drug companies, and guts protections for pre-existing conditions, because they're bought by insurance and pharmaceutical industries — that's corruption.
* When dark money from secret donors and powerful industries floods our airwaves with vicious propaganda — that's corruption.
I believe we are all called to fight the abuse of power, even when the odds are against us. That’s why I’m running for Senate. But I can’t do it alone. I’m relying on donations from people like you, not from corporate PACs. So I’m humbly asking you to donate anything you can:
Chip in $5 immediately >>
Chip in $35 immediately >>
Chip in $50 immediately >>

My opponent, David Perdue is as corrupt and out-of-touch as politicians come. Perdue is the caricature of Washington corruption.
This is a man who actually lives on a private island. He made a fortune as a CEO who bragged about shipping jobs overseas before his family’s political machine launched him to high office.
And he was just caught trading casino, pharmaceutical, and PPE stock after the Senate had a classified briefing on the Coronavirus!
Perdue has also taken MILLIONS from shady corporate PACs. In fact, my opponent has taken so much money from corporate PACs that the Federal Election Commission said he violated federal law!
David Perdue serves himself and his donors — not the people he represents.
We must defeat him in November.
And David Perdue is vulnerable. A recent poll has me beating him by 1%.
But he has a MASSIVE campaign warchest (full of all that corporate PAC money), and President Trump is repaying his loyalty with huge pay-for-access fundraisers. If we’re going to beat Perdue -- and help Democrats win back the Senate -- I’ll need your help.
Can you make a donation now to help me defeat Trump’s favorite Senator?

Thanks for reading this whole email!
We are fighting on the right side of history. The stakes are sky-high. We must win, and together we WILL win.

Friend,
Our nation is in crisis.
As I'm writing to you, amidst a public health emergency, President Trump is deploying unidentified federal troops to patrol our cities and snatch American citizens into unmarked vans on our streets.
We *must* win the White House and secure a majority in the U.S. Senate.
That's why today I'm urging you to join me in supporting my friend Jon Ossoff for U.S. Senate in Georgia.
Jon is an investigative journalist and media executive whose company has exposed bribery, human traffickers, war crimes, and corporate abuses.
I've gotten to know Jon over the last few years, and his passion for exposing corruption and the abuse of power is EXACTLY what's called for in the Senate today.
I want Jon Ossoff to fight alongside me in the U.S. Senate. So I'm asking you to help:
Send $5 so Jon Ossoff can WIN in Georgia
Since winning the Democratic nomination in a landslide, Jon has earned the endorsement of organizations like NARAL Pro-Choice America, Planned Parenthood, and the Human Rights Campaign.
Friend, they all know what I know: Jon Ossoff is a champion of the people who will stand up to corruption and the abuse of power.
Trump and Mitch McConnell know Jon is a threat. Republican super PACs have already committed more than $21 million to try to stop him. We need to show our grassroots power and equip Jon to hit back twice as hard.
Can you chip in $5 to elect Jon Ossoff and flip Georgia blue?

Friend, it's long past time to end Mitch McConnell's reign in the Senate.
If Democrats win the Senate majority, we won't have to worry about another two years of extreme right-wing judges and disgraceful attempts to rip health care away from millions of Americans.
Instead, we will be able to make real progress on the issues that are important to us: making prescription drugs affordable, taking meaningful steps to combat the climate crisis, addressing police brutality, keeping our children safe from gun violence, and securing equal justice for all.
Georgia is a key battleground state and Jon is running to win one of the most flippable seats in the Senate. For Democrats to win a Senate majority, we have to win this seat.
And Jon has what it takes to win.
But only with your help, friend.
If you want to flip the Senate and end Mitch McConnell's majority, will you chip in $5 right now to elect Jon Ossoff in Georgia?

Thank you for stepping up,

Friend,
On November 3, we are going to close the door on Donald Trump's presidency. Then, we can expand our potential to make real progress on the issues that make a difference in people's lives.
But to achieve that potential, we need my friend Jon Ossoff in the United States Senate. Here's why:
It's time to elect a new generation of leaders. And Jon Ossoff's achievements as an investigative journalist -- leading a team that's exposed war crimes, enslavement, murder, and bribery all over the planet -- speak to his courage, his values, and his toughness.
Jon and his supporters have made this one of the country's most competitive races during a time when dozens of states are coming into play. So today I'm asking you to dig deep and invest in Jon's victory. Will you donate right now to help Jon Ossoff win in Georgia and flip the Senate?

Senate Republicans have used the past four years to give tax breaks to the wealthy, scheme how to take health care away from millions, and confirm scores of unqualified or extreme judicial and executive nominees.
The solution to removing the GOP stranglehold on the Senate lies in no small part with Jon Ossoff in Georgia. Jon is surging in the polls as more and more voters learn about his history fighting corruption.
But here's what's even more important: Jon is someone Georgians can rely on. He is focused on ensuring every American has affordable health care and rebuilding the economy so working families and small businesses thrive, and he's committed to passing a new Voting Rights Act and a new Civil Rights Act.
When I look at Georgia, I see what Virginia looked like just a few years ago. Democrats are making huge inroads, and if we can all do our part to invest and help good, smart leaders like Jon reach the finish line, we can flip Georgia.
Jon is neck-and-neck in the polls with his pro-Trump opponent who has repeatedly voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But the GOP knows control of the Senate comes down to Georgia, so they are spending big to keep their power. Mitch McConnell's allies and super PACs have already committed over $25 million to stop Jon.
Jon isn't taking contributions from corporate PACs or federal lobbyists. That means he's relying on a small-dollar grassroots campaign to power him to victory.
We can't flip the Senate without you, friend. Can you chip in $15 to elect Jon Ossoff in Georgia and help chart a new course for this country?

Hey friend,
I wanted to bump this email from my team -- it's important everyone understands exactly who we're up against.
It's pretty simple: David Perdue will vote with his donors in the insurance industry to end health care protections for Georgians who are fighting for their lives, then lie in public about it.
Senator Perdue is totally blinded by corruption and corporate influence. And he's such a creature of the Washington swamp, he'll lie shamelessly about what he's done.
Fighting corruption is literally my job. My business has exposed bribery, the abuse of power, war crimes, and organized crime around the world.

Subject: Jon's opponent is deceiving voters
Friend,
Sen. David Perdue is trying to deceive Georgia voters in his ads.
In his latest ad, Perdue said health insurance should cover pre-existing conditions -- even though he has voted MULTIPLE TIMES against ensuring protections for the 1.8 million Georgians with pre-existing conditions, and supports a lawsuit that could kick nearly 500,000 Georgians off their health care.
David Perdue is getting desperate -- because he knows he is going to lose.
He has to deceive his constituents, because his record is indefensible. He puts lobbyists and donors first, and his constituents last!
The people of Georgia deserve a leader like Jon Ossoff who they can trust to protect and strengthen their health care -- not someone who has to lie about his record to win votes.

David Perdue enables the corruption in Washington.
He has taken nearly $300,000 from health industry PACs (!!!), all while voting in their favor.
And he isn't the only one.
In 2019, the pharmaceutical and health products industry alone employed 1,471 lobbyists -- that's nearly three lobbyists per member of Congress!
Friend, corporate lobbyists have too much influence over politicians from both parties -- our elected officials should be serving the people!
This widespread corruption needs to end!
And Jon is determined to clean up Washington!
He will ban corporate political donations and secret corporate money in politics. He is the anti-corruption crusader that Georgians and Americans need.
Friend, can you pitch in $20 to send Jon to Washington and elect a leader who will put the people first and ensure everyone's access to affordable health care?

And I learned in 2017, when I ran for Congress, that we can build a grassroots army to rival the power of the corrupt machine.
I believe we are all called to stand up to the abuse of power.
Real talk — here’s what at stake:
Corruption threatens our republic.
* When 9 out of 10 Americans support universal background checks but Congress refuses because they're bought by the NRA — that’s corruption.
* When Congress won’t crack down on price gouging by drug companies, and guts protections for pre-existing conditions, because they're bought by insurance and pharmaceutical industries — that's corruption.
* When the federal government silences its own environmental scientists because science threatens the fossil fuel industry — that's corruption.
* When dark money from secret donors and powerful industries floods our airwaves with vicious propaganda — that's corruption.
Let’s fight back together. The time has come to launch an all-out attack on corruption in America.
I’m REFUSING corporate PAC donations. That means I’m relying on grassroots supporters like you to power us to victory. Please join me and help send me to the Senate to fight for us >>

Desiree Tims for Congress
Alex,
Juneteenth is celebrated on this day to commemorate the freeing of the enslaved people of Texas, who had been legally freed two years prior by the Emancipation Proclamation.
While this day marks the true end of slavery in the United States, we know all too well the history of the past 100 years. Jim Crow, segregation, redlining, disparate sentencing, and wage disparities have crippled many Black Americans from accessing the full American dream.
As the last month has highlighted, racial equity is still a goal we’re striving to meet. We’re still fighting to be treated equally in our own country, working to raise awareness for the unique issues facing the Black community, and protesting and mourning when our brothers and sisters are murdered for the crime of being Black in America.
As we recommit ourselves to continuing down the long road in front of us, we should all take time to remember those that came before us. The enslaved men and women who knew no life beyond a plantation; the impoverished sharecroppers -- like my grandfather -- who were exploited in all-too-familiar ways in the South; leaders like Dr. King and Medgar Evers who were gunned down for imagining a country that lived up to our professed ideals of freedom and equality; and the names echoing through our streets today whose lives were taken by police brutality: We must honor their memory by continuing our fight for justice.
I’ll never forget the shoulders I stand on. And I’ll never forget the sacrifices of not just my ancestors, but of all the people who have led movements for change, justice, and equality.
This Juneteenth, can you help me become the first African American to represent Ohio’s 10th District? Here’s a secure link to donate to my campaign: [[URL REDACTED]]

Hey Alex,
This past week, the House passed the Emmett Till Anti-lynching Act with only four dissenting votes. This is a step in the right direction, but I can’t help but think how history would be different had this been passed a century ago.
Lynching was a horrific crime and the fact that it took until 2020 to pass a law making it a federal crime is unacceptable.
This is why we need more African-Americans representing us at all levels of government.
It was the hard work of African-American Senators and Representatives that made this bill a reality, and when I’m in Congress, I will join these brave legislators in their unending fight for true equity.

Desiree Tims for Congress
Alex,
The events of this past week are all too familiar. A Black man was murdered in broad daylight by a white police officer.
His name was George Floyd, and he died for committing the crime of being Black in America.
Since then, protests have erupted across the country. Black people, tired of seeing their brothers and sisters murdered on the streets and in their own homes, have shown they’re not going to take this oppression any longer.
This weekend, I joined one of those peaceful demonstrations. Together, we did one of the most American things possible: we gathered peacefully and had our voices heard.
I told the crowd that now is not the time to give up -- now is the time to lean in. Because while it’s easy to be depressed about the state of our country, I know we have the potential to do so much better, and that’s why I’m fighting for the people of the Miami Valley and Southwest Ohio.
We all must continue to speak up and hold our leaders accountable, protest, and vote. This problem isn’t going to go away on its own, the people need to show that we’re not going to take this oppression.
In memory of George Floyd, John Crawford, Ahmaud Arbery, Tamir Rice, Atatiana Jefferson, Breona Taylor, Sandra Bland, and all those we’ve lost on the journey to equal justice—you are remembered.
In solidarity,
Desiree Tims

Republican officials tested their November voter suppression strategy on our primary a few weeks ago.
We all saw what happened -- six-hour lines, broken voting machines, and missing absentee ballots.

Now, at a moment when political corruption is destroying our democracy, I'm taking that fight to the Senate.
My GOP opponent was too busy trading medical and vaccine stocks to prepare our state for this pandemic.
Senator David Perdue is corrupt, and a Trump puppet.
He doesn’t represent my state’s values.
We need a SURGE of grassroots support to replace him in November.
Here’s the bottom line: If we fail to hit our fundraising goal this month, we'll be off track for the rest of the campaign and risk control of the Senate.

* * *
Dear Alex —
In the last six months, we’ve seen, again and again, the failures of our criminal legal system. A system that disproportionately punishes and incarcerates Black Americans is a system that is fundamentally unjust.
These problems exist at the local level, in our backyard jurisdictions and county courthouses. So if we’re going to make systemic change, we must look locally. Gary Tyack understands this, which is why I’m proud to support him in his campaign for Franklin County Prosecutor. Can you split a donation today between Gary’s campaign and our Ohio Voter Fund?
Contribute > >
County prosecutors play a crucial role in determining how our legal system operates. Here are just a few parts of Gary’s platform that make him the right candidate for the job:
* Create youth programs: Instead of incarceration for low-level crimes, Gary will push for young people to be redirected towards counseling, mental healthcare, tutoring, and other proactive measures. This will mark a step towards ending the school-to-prison pipeline and the incarceration state that has trapped so many Americans.
* Decriminalize mental illness and addiction: Gary will seek to establish a community-based stabilization center in partnership with the county and existing programs, so that anyone experiencing a mental health crisis or struggling with drug addiction will receive the care they need, without unnecessary intervention from police.
* Ensure equity in prosecution: By establishing a database that would allow the prosecutor to continually monitor for charging discrepancies within communities of color, Gary would proactively work to create a justice system that is fair and equitable.
Put simply, we need people like Gary in these positions if we hope to undo a long history of injustice at every level of government.
So, if you’re able, will you contribute today? Your donation will be evenly split between Gary’s campaign and our Ohio Voter Fund.

Alex -- I’m asking you for $5 to help me defeat Devin Nunes (Trump’s FAVORITE Congressman). Here’s why:
* Polls are SO CLOSE. And Devin barely won re-election in 2018.
* Trump is scared to death of our campaign. He knows we can really win.
* Republicans are FLOODING Devin Nunes with cash to crush our campaign!
In all honesty, their Republican mega-bucks could sink us. I won’t have the resources to compete without your help.

89,"The people of Maine deserve a senator who puts them first.
#
Friends —
The people of Maine deserve a senator who puts them first.
They deserve a senator who fights to make our country work for everyone, not the special interests.
They deserve a senator who isn't afraid to speak truth to power.
They deserve Sara Gideon, the Democratic nominee for this November — not Republican Susan Collins.
Let's help elect Sara Gideon, unseat Susan Collins, and flip one of the key seats Democrats need to take back the Senate.
If making a donation makes sense for you right now, please chip in $3 or whatever you can to support Sara Gideon so we can win big in Maine.
So, let's talk about Susan Collins.
In 2018, when she cast one of the deciding votes to give Brett Kavanaugh a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, she said that he would uphold precedents that protect abortion rights.
How did that work out? Well, last month, he voted to overturn one of those precedents — and now, he's got Roe v. Wade in his sights.
Earlier this year, when Susan Collins voted against convicting Donald Trump in the Senate, she said that he didn't need to be held accountable because he already learned a ""pretty big lesson"" from being impeached.
Yeah, sure, he's learned his lesson — he's learned there are enough Republican enablers in the Senate who will let him do anything he wants. He's learned that lesson so well that recently, he rewarded Roger Stone with a presidential pardon for committing crimes to protect Trump.
Meanwhile, as Speaker of Maine's House of Representatives, Sara Gideon has been clear-eyed about the corruption that rewards the wealthy and well-connected, and committed to getting results for the people she serves.
Sara Gideon has helped protect health care for Mainers with pre-existing conditions, fight the opioid crisis by expanding treatment and prevention while pledging to hold giant drug companies accountable for causing this crisis, and stood up for reproductive justice.
Now, Sara Gideon is ready to keep serving Maine as a U.S. Senator. But the polls show that this race is going to be competitive, and Susan Collins is a longtime incumbent who won't be easy to beat.
We need to fight side by side as a grassroots movement to send Sara Gideon to Washington. Can you make a donation right now to support her campaign? Anything you can contribute would make a real difference in this powerfully important race.
Thanks for being a part of this,
Elizabeth

For Immediate Release
[[URL REDACTED]]
Eric Early for Congress Endorsed by
Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy
On the heels of a blockbuster fundraising quarter, the GOP challenger to Adam Schiff has locked up another major endorsement
LOS ANGELES, Calif. \- Today, GOP Congressional candidate and prominent attorney Eric Early, has announced the endorsement from Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of his campaign to unseat Rep. Adam Schiff. The endorsement comes on the heels of a blockbuster fundraising quarter for Early who raised more than $795,000 last quarter entirely from individual donors across the United States.
“Eric Early has earned my endorsement and full support in his fight to unseat Congressman Adam Schiff. As a successful business owner, Eric understands our free market economy and the need to defeat the socialist agenda that now controls Schiff’s Democrat Party.""
""The good people of Southern California’s 28th Congressional District have been neglected for far too long by Schiff, while he has focused on attacking the President. Eric Early has a plan to finally take meaningful steps to fight the District’s homeless epidemic, support law enforcement and law and order, and help the District’s job creators rebuild from the effects of Covid-19 – but first we must defeat Adam Schiff. I hope you join me in supporting Eric Early for Congress.” - House Minority Leader, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).
The race for California's 28th Congressional District in years past has seen lackluster enthusiasm from GOP supporters with past challengers failing to raise the money requisite to compete. This year however, in large part due to Early's strong campaign, the Republican challenger is gaining momentum and capitalizing on Schiff's failed partisan charades and neglect of district residents.
""I am honored to receive Leader McCarthy's endorsement and I am beyond grateful to the thousands of patriotic Americans across our country that have helped us start closing the fundraising gap,"" said GOP candidate Eric Early. ""Adam Schiff raised millions of dollars off his lies to the American people and all the while the residents in our District have seen out-of-control homelessness, rising crime, thousands of independent contractor jobs destroyed and now the devastation caused by COVID. The role of a member of the House of Representatives is to advocate for their constituents in Washington. Schiff, instead, has solely focused on hatching political schemes while conditions in our District have deteriorated massively. That all ends this November.”
Eric Early's campaign has challenged Adam Schiff to numerous debates in-District, yet a date and location has not been accepted by Schiff.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) lowered a prison sentence last week for close Trump ally Roger Stone after the president tweeted that the sentence was “unfair.”
Now, as this scandal unfolds, more than 2,450 former DOJ employees have signed a letter1 calling on Trump's Attorney General, William Barr, to RESIGN.
SIGN ON and join them: Our country’s top law enforcement officer must enforce the law, not do the president’s personal bidding. Attorney General Barr must resign immediately →
No one is above the law! Attorney General William Barr must resign.
The letter’s signers include lawyers who worked under both Republican and Democratic presidents:
As former DOJ officials, we each proudly took an oath to support and defend our Constitution and faithfully execute the duties of our offices. The very first of these duties is to apply the law equally to all Americans…
A person should not be given special treatment in a criminal prosecution because they are a close political ally of the President. Governments that use the enormous power of law enforcement to punish their enemies and reward their allies are not constitutional republics; they are autocracies.
Roger Stone was convicted of making false statements to Congress and witness tampering. Those are serious crimes.
We can’t have an Attorney General who would let someone off easy just because the president wants him to!

We’re up against a candidate whose record proves he’s not in this fight for the families of our community -- and we must fight back.
Troy Nehls is a former police officer with a long record of misconduct, from being discharged for mishandling evidence to lying about being charged with a crime in a sworn statement. He’s attacked survivors of sex trafficking and downplayed and denied the existence of coronavirus even as his own employeers got sick -- and he’s proven eager to become a mouthpiece of Washington special interests and gut health care for millions of families across this state.
Sri Preston Kulkarni is a lifelong public servant and diplomat who knows firsthand what it’s like to nearly go broke from our broken health care system. He’s in this fight to stand for working families in our district and expand access to affordable care, not gut it.

97,"Team,
I wanted to follow up on the email my campaign manager Allen sent to you recently.
Not only is my Republican opponent, Kathaleen Wall’s pay-to-play attitude all wrong for Texas -- her rhetoric is even worse.
In just the last month Wall:
* Thanked the coronavirus “for saving lives”, because it created an excuse for Governor Greg Abbott to shutter Planned Parenthood and other reproductive health clinics in Texas.
* Released a dangerous ad attacking Chinese Americans for COVID-19 at a time when hate crimes against our AAPI community are already on the rise.
These statements from Wall aren’t just outrageous, team. They’re dangerous and disregard the safety and well-being of some of our most vulnerable residents.
Scapegoating Asian Americans and celebrating the governor’s attempts to block women from exercising their right to make their own health care choices is no way to campaign -- and it’s no way to govern.
I know times are tough right now, but if you’re able to give a donation to our team to help us defeat Kathaleen Wall and her attempt to buy this election, we would be incredibly grateful.
Thank you,
-Sri

Kathaleen Wall is looking to ensure her interests are put above the community’s -- plain and simple, team.
With millions of dollars in personal checks and a small-dollar donor rate of less than 0.0%, Wall is running a pay-to-play campaign to get her into Congress.
Wall is just another mega-donor looking to buy influence and protect her own special interests. Her campaign isn’t about helping everyday Texans -- it’s about power and prestige.
We can’t let Wall use her checkbook to put her agenda above the community’s, team. Not when so much is at risk.
If you can, please donate to our campaign to bring true leadership to TX-22 by electing proven public servant -- Sri Preston Kulkarni.

Friends,
Since 1918, there have been nearly 200 failed attempts to make lynching a federal crime.
What you do now will determine if our next attempt fails again, or if we finally get it done. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Tim Scott have a bill that has strong bipartisan support. It would pass and be sitting on the President's desk to sign or veto -- but Mitch McConnell won't bring it to the floor for a vote. Yesterday, it took only one extremist Senator to block it.
This isn’t partisan. There are plenty of votes in both parties to pass this. That’s why Mitch McConnell won’t allow a vote. He wants it to fail for what is close to the 200th time.
Contact your Senator. Demand that a vote be held. Sign my petition and make your voice heard today >>
In this moment where we must come together as a country to meaningfully discuss steps toward ending centuries of systemic racism, what a horrible message the failure of this bill would be. Passing this bill is far from the only thing we must do to combat injustice and racism, but when we have an opportunity to right an obvious wrong with bipartisan support, we must seize it.
We cannot let Mitch McConnell stop what is so clearly the right thing to do.
Thank you.

We are closely monitoring the situation and its effects on the people of Texas and our nation as we work together to keep our families and communities safe.
Friends,
Nixon only had one Friday Night Massacre. This presidency has given us so many Friday Night Massacres that we’ve lost count.
Now, William Barr and Donald Trump tried to illegally remove the chief prosecutor investigating Trump’s crimes in New York — and a constitutional crisis was only averted when the prosecutor willingly stepped down after the fact.
Add your name and demand Attorney General Barr’s resignation for abusing his power to serve the president’s political agenda >>>
What was once unprecedented, undemocratic, and impeachable has become business as usual under Trump and Attorney General Barr. They think they can get away with intervening in the work of a prosecutor investigating Trump’s finances and misconduct.

This election will determine whether Trump faces any consequences for his misconduct. Thanks to enablers like Van Taylor, the risk of him getting away with it is all too real.
As an attorney, I’ve spent 20 years taking on rich and powerful interests, and holding them accountable. I’m running for Congress now to hold Trump, Barr, and every leader who abuses their power accountable. We can’t let them get away with this — our democracy is on the line.

Folks,
Today is Juneteenth -- the day we commemorate the ending of legal slavery in Texas when men and women in Galveston received the news of their freedom, almost two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed.
We know the end of slavery did not translate into full equality. Institutionalized racism, discrimination and hate crimes are far too commonplace in America.
Still to this day, racism is impacting every aspect of our society. From the criminal justice system to employment, black men and women are still striving to achieve true equality.
We still have so much further to go.
In Congress, I will fight to ensure everyone, no matter their race, ethnicity or background, is equal under the law and has an equal opportunity to succeed. This Juneteenth, we recognize our obligation to ensure liberty, freedom and justice for all.

102,"Dear Friend,
While the past few months have been undoubtedly hard for all of us, I want to take a moment to acknowledge how painful this time has been for our Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, especially as we come to the end of the first full week of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.
This should be a joyful time for our community -- one where we celebrate our history and our diverse cultures -- but with both the spread of coronavirus and the rise in anti-Asian American discrimination that has accompanied it, this year feels different.
Asian American-owned businesses have been disproportionately impacted by this crisis, even before shelter-in-place and social distancing orders, because of misinformation spread about the virus. Too many AAPIs have been harassed and even physically attacked. And rather than condemning this disturbing trend, our president and high-ranking Republican members of Congress have repeatedly used a racist term for the coronavirus.
If you have experienced a hate crime or bias incident in New York, you can report it by emailing the Attorney General’s Civil Rights Bureau at [[URL REDACTED]], or by calling 1-800-771-7755.
If there's one thing I know about our community, it's that we're stronger together. We can look to AAPI trailblazers from our past, from Larry Itliong to Patsy Mink, to inspire us to keep moving forward, fighting against hate, and supporting one another. We can also look to the daily courage and sacrifice of the more than 2 million AAPIs who are working on the frontlines of this pandemic. They are our nurses, doctors, grocery and convenience store owners and employees, janitors, law enforcement officers, transportation workers, and so many other kinds of essential workers -- and they are keeping us safe each and every day. This month and every month, I'm committed to fighting for our AAPI communities and for every community that needs a voice in our government.
I hope this email finds you and your family safe and healthy. I'll be thinking of you, and will continue to reach out with updates as this crisis continues.
Wishing you all the best,
Grace

103,"Your campaign brief for July 11, 2020 View this email in your browser
Hey Alex -
Dan Crenshaw here. I hope you are well.
This week, I continued to call for a strategy to reopen schools in the fall and also spoke out against calls to defund the police. In case you missed it, I also published an op-ed last week about why we need to fight hard to tell the right story of America.
Follow me on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for regular updates and news you can use. As always, thank you for your support.
Now, here’s your brief:
WE NEED TO SAFELY REOPEN SCHOOLS IN THE FALL
Kids and their parents have suffered the most from the impact of extended school closures. Students aren’t learning as much, child abuse is on the rise, and parents are struggling to juggle home-schooling and their jobs. It’s why I’m calling for a strategy to reopen schools in the fall.
The American Academy of Pediatrics agrees. In a recent report published by AAP, the organization “strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school.”
We cannot ignore the educational, social, and other public health harms inflicted upon our families by extended school closures. We need to do everything in our power to get kids back to school safely.
DEMOCRAT POLICIES PUT THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AT RISK
The data coming out of New York City is troubling. Violent crime is skyrocketing while the New York Police Department faces a troubling surge of officers filing for retirement. We’re watching the results of Democrat governance in real time. Encourage the mob, defund the police, “bail reform,” while communities are torn apart.
What’s worse? According to the NYPD, “every single person who has been shot in New York City this July, nearly 100 in total, has been a member of the minority community and 97% of shooting victims in June were members of the city’s minority communities.”
As I have said before, those leading the calls to defund the police live in neighborhoods that won’t suffer the effects of this radical policy. Minority communities suffer the most when police cannot do their jobs, which is why I have spoken out against this policy so forcefully.
America must wake up to the reality of allowing Democrats to win in November. The safety of our communities - all of our communities - is at stake.
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: WE NEED TO TELL THE RIGHT STORY OF AMERICA
We need to start telling the right story about America, or our great experiment unravels. In the last few weeks thousands have taken to the streets in protests that questioned whether America values all of its citizens with the same worth, and questioned whether the ideals upon which our great country was founded are good.
That’s why we must state unequivocally: America is good. In fact, it’s great.
In a recent op-ed in The Hill, I argue that while it’s important to recognize the sins of our country, we must also recognize that these sins do not render corrupt the foundational ideals of America. Our imperfections do not define us. What does define us is the greatness that America has generated.
Click here to read the op-ed.
Sign the pledge to elect leaders who will teach our kids to love America.

DAN CRENSHAW FOR CONGRESS
Alex -
Texas vs California. Good governance vs bad governance.
This is what’s at stake in November. Click here or on the image above to watch and share this with your friends.
Democrats are spending millions to flip the Texas State House, and our State Rep candidates desperately need help. It’s an emergency. Our prosperity is on the line.
Associated Republicans of Texas is working hard to support these candidates. Please chip in ANY AMOUNT IMMEDIATELY to help them GET OUT THE VOTE.
CHIP IN TO SAVE TEXAS
In Service,
Dan Crenshaw
FULL TRANSCRIPT
What makes for good governance?
Safe communities, Less regulations, lower taxes, and minimal interference from government - Giving people the freedom to make their own choices.
And what does bad governance look like?
Defunding the police, refusing to enforce the law, more regulations, higher taxes, and a government-knows-best attitude.
Don’t believe me? Well lets compare a large state run by Democrats, California, to a large state run by Republicans, Texas.
California, a beautiful state with millions of hardworking Americans. California rose to prosperity under Republican governance, but in recent decades it has been devastated by one party, Democrat rule. An unemployment rate of more than 11% - one of the highest in the country. The 4th highest electricity prices in the country. Rolling blackouts, forest fires, rising crime and homelessness.
The Tax Foundation ranks California 48th in terms of business climate. California is also ranked 48th in terms of regulatory burdens. And California’s cost of living is 50 percent higher than the national average.
Now, people are fleeing the state in droves. Businesses are closing down by the thousands. Jobs are leaving the state in record numbers.
In just 2018 and 2019—economic boom years—765 commercial facilities left California. Large companies like Toyota, Charles Schwab, and Jamba Juice.
An estimated 13,000 businesses left between 2008 and 2016. 275,000 jobs left the state and $76 billion in capital funds were diverted during the same period.
And where are these jobs fleeing to? Texas.
More than 86,000 people moved to Texas from California in 2018 alone. A U-Haul from Los Angeles to Houston costs more than $2,000. A U-Haul from Houston to Los Angeles costs $600.
The reason is simple. We have smart policies that work. We empower people instead of trying to control them.
Texas has no personal income tax. Our unemployment rate is just half of California’s even though our COVID trends were similar. Texas has some of the lowest electricity prices in the country. Texas is the best state in America to start a new business, according to studies.
We also treat the environment better. We are a leader in energy innovation and wind power, and our emphasis on private land ownership makes it much easier to manage forests and prevent wildfires.
So you have to ask yourself, why switch form good governance to bad governance?
Millions of dollars are flooding into Texas to make our state more like California. They’re trying to “Turn Texas Blue” and they won’t stop until they control our state legislature, control the Governor’s mansion, and flip our U.S. House and Senate Seats.
We have to stop them.
The front line of this defense to save Texas is the Texas State House, and we have incredible young, diverse candidates that need our help as they fight against millions of dollars of out-of-state donations from the likes of far-left billionaires like Mike Bloomberg and George Soros.
We need to keep Texas prosperous. We need to Keep Texas free. We need to keep Texas REPUBLICAN.
When you donate to Associated Republicans of Texas, you donate to a one stop shop for saving the Texas State House. We need your help. Its all on the line. Donate today, save Texas.

Ashley Hinson on Immigration in 2020: Work Together to make America More Secure, More Safe, and Better Equipped to Handle Workforce Needs
2019 was the year the U.S. immigration system reached a breaking point. Last February more than 76,000 migrants crossed the border without authorization—an 11-year high—and arrests along the southern border increased 97 percent.
Even facing a clear crisis, Washington politicians continued to make immigration about politics instead of national security. As a result, the security crisis at our border also evolved into a humanitarian crisis with rampant human trafficking and drugs like fentanyl pouring into our communities and fueling the opioid crisis.
We can’t afford a February like our last. That’s why I’m calling on Congress to shift their focus away from impeachment and onto finally fixing our broken immigration system.
First and foremost, we must support increasing funding for border security. We can’t fix our immigration system without first securing the border. Congress has approved billions for President Trump’s border wall but Democrats haven’t made it easy. We need to make sure security at the southern border is funded and Immigration Custom Enforcement Officers have the resources they need to stop violent criminals and dangerous drugs from entering our country.
Last year ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations arrested and convicted more than 200,000 individuals for crimes such as homicide, kidnapping, sexual assault, drugs and Driving Under the Influence but too often our border agents are pulled away from their law enforcement duties to tend to the humanitarian needs of the mass illegal immigration, making our borders less secure. ICE officers should have bipartisan support.
While we must focus on stopping heinous crimes and ending illegal immigration, we should also support legal immigration.
Immigrants are a huge asset to our culture, our economy, and they’re our neighbors and friends. In Iowa, immigrants are a vital component of our state’s labor force. According to the American Immigration Council, there are 96,089 immigrant workers in Iowa in various industries like manufacturing, educational services and construction.
It is critical that we fix our legal immigration system so states like ours can have workforce needs met. This means streamlining America’s skilled-worker visa system to make it easier for businesses to hire and retain the workers they need.
The U.S. Senate should move quickly to pass Senator Joni Ernst’s bill, Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act. This bipartisan legislation would move the per-country cap for employment-based green card applications, making it easier for talent across the world to bring their skills here.
With an immigration system in desperate need of repair, it’s no secret that our representatives instead shamefully focused on destroying the President. Extreme politicians need to stop putting politics over public safety and sensationalism over solutions.
The way forward to fix our immigration system is simple, but it’s a tall order for today’s partisanship: Democrats and Republicans should work together to make our nation more secure, more safe and better equipped to hire the best and brightest for our workforce.

Let me explain:
Here's what you need to know about my dad: I’ve grown up watching my dad fight for what’s right, no matter what.
As an investigative journalist, he exposed defense contractors secretly installing defective parts on Black Hawk Helicopters, endangering the lives of our troops.
While reporting a story, he met a Vietnam Veteran with PTSD. The man was homeless, eating from trash bins, and had been wrongfully denied benefits because the government said he didn’t actually fight in Vietnam.
My dad flew across the country, hunted down his commanding officer, relentlessly challenged the Pentagon’s claim that the man didn’t serve in combat operations, and ultimately won $60,000 in back pay and a monthly benefits package for the Veteran.
He exposed corrupt politicians involved in an organized crime racket and a police brutality coverup that ultimately led to the officers being fired and charged.
I know my dad is exactly who we need fighting for us in Congress. If you agree, I’m asking you to chip in even just $5 so he can win >>
Here’s what you need to know about this race:
This is one of Democrats’ top opportunities to flip a seat blue.
Republicans have just a 1-point advantage in voter registrations.
This race will come down to just a handful of votes and every fundraising goal is critical.
How you can have a massive impact: My dad’s sticking to the values he taught me and my brother by running a people-first campaign.
That means he is rejecting all corporate PAC money.
The support of grassroots donors, like you, will determine if he wins or loses this race.

Alan Cohn for Congress
I need to talk to you about my dad, Alan Cohn.
I’m so proud of him.
He’s running to unseat the most vulnerable Republican in Florida, our corrupt Congressman Ross Spano.
I’ll be honest, I’ve never emailed asking strangers for money before. But I know what is at stake. My dad needs to raise $5,600 in the next 24 hours or he'll be forced to make devastating budget cuts. So I’m asking, please donate at this make-or-break moment >>
Let me explain:
Here's what you need to know about my dad: I’ve grown up watching my dad fight for what’s right, no matter what.
As an investigative journalist, he exposed defense contractors secretly installing defective parts on Black Hawk Helicopters, endangering the lives of our troops.
While reporting a story, he met a Vietnam Veteran with PTSD. The man was homeless, eating from trash bins, and had been wrongfully denied benefits because the government said he didn’t actually fight in Vietnam.
My dad flew across the country, hunted down his commanding officer, relentlessly challenged the Pentagon’s claim that the man didn’t serve in combat operations, and ultimately won $60,000 in back pay and a monthly benefits package for the Veteran.
He exposed corrupt politicians involved in an organized crime racket and a police brutality coverup that ultimately led to the officers being fired and charged.
I know my dad is exactly who we need fighting for us in Congress. If you agree, I’m asking you to chip in even just $5 so he can win >>
Here’s what you need to know about this race: Congressman Ross Spano is under criminal investigation for illegal campaign activity.
I’m disgusted, but not surprised, that the GOP is still shoveling in money to elect him and keep this House seat.
One thing is for sure, this is one of Democrats' top opportunities to flip a seat blue.
How you can have a massive impact: My dad’s sticking to the values he taught me and my brother by running a people-first campaign.
That means he is rejecting all corporate PAC money.
The support of grassroots donors, like you, will determine if he wins or loses this race.
Can I count on you to chip in? Even a couple of dollars gets us closer to our $5,600 goal. Please click here and contribute:  [[URL REDACTED]][[EMAIL_REDACTED]]

FACT: Ross Spano is the most vulnerable Republican in Florida \-- and some argue the country.
He has been exposed as a corrupt criminal who committed campaign finance fraud. He’s been under investigation by the Justice Department, the House Ethics Committee, and the Florida Bar for over a year and faces likely jail time for his crimes.
This election is a once in a lifetime opportunity to oust Spano and flip FL-15 blue.

Democrats Can Win Florida in 2020. But they have to work a lot harder and they have to do it now.
A Republican hasn’t won the White House without winning Florida in over 100 years.
So if we’re going to oust Trump, Democrats need to win BIG in Florida.
And it is campaigns like mine who are doing the groundwork to turn Floridian Democrats out this November.

FACT: The GOP is desperate to hold onto Ross Spano’s seat:
* Republican leadership PACs have given Spano $77,000.
* The NRA, fossil fuel industries, and corporate PACs are funneling him tens of thousands of dollars.
* And the GOP elite are POURING money directly into Spano’s campaign.
I’m so proud that my campaign is funded by union workers, educators, and other hard working Americans like you.

Alex,
Will you help us win the single most important senate race in 2020? My close friend and fellow veteran Senator Joni Ernst is on the ballot and she’s under attack.
Soros, Bloomberg, and liberal dark money groups are already pouring millions of dollars into Iowa to try to beat Joni.
Why? Because they know that Joni is a rock-solid conservative. She is pro-life. She opposes amnesty and sanctuary cities. She’s tough on crime, and she’s fought for conservative judges.
The Left knows that if they can beat Joni Ernst, they’ll be able to replace a conservative combat veteran with an open-borders socialist.
I don’t intend to let that happen. And that’s why I’m asking for your help. Will you make a contribution that will be split between my campaign and Joni’s?
With your help, we can win this race, and you can send Joni and me back to fight for President Trump’s agenda and oppose what the radical socialists are trying to do to our country.

Cotton Remarks on Voting Against Articles of Impeachment
Washington, D.C. — Earlier today, Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) submitted remarks into the Congressional Record announcing his intent to vote against both articles of impeachment. The text of those remarks in its entirety may be found below.
I will soon join a majority of the Senate in voting down the articles of impeachment brought against the president by his partisan opponents. The time has come to end a spectacle that has elevated the obsessions of Washington's political class over the concerns and interests of the American people.
This round of impeachment is just the latest Democratic scheme to bring down the president. I say ""this round"" because House Democrats have tried to impeach President Trump at least four times. First, for being mean to football players. Then for his transgender military policy. Next for his immigration policy. And those are just the impeachment attempts. Along the way, Democrats also proclaimed that Robert Mueller would drive the president from office. Some even speculated that the vice president and the cabinet would invoke the 25th Amendment to seize power from the president—a theory that sounds more like Resistance fan fiction than reality.
What's behind this fanaticism? Simply put, the Democrats have never accepted that Donald Trump won the 2016 election, and they will never forgive him, either.
It's time for the Democrats to get some perspective. They're claiming that we ought to impeach and remove a president from office for the first time in our history for briefly pausing aid to Ukraine and rescheduling a meeting with the Ukrainian president, allegedly in return for a corruption inquiry. But the aid was released after a few weeks and the meeting occurred, yet the inquiry did not—even though, I would add, it remains justified by the Biden family's obvious, glaring conflict of interest in Ukraine.
Just how badly have the Democrats lost perspective? The House managers have argued that we ought to impeach and remove the president because his meeting with the Ukrainian president happened in New York, not Washington.
When most Americans think about why a president ought to be impeached and removed from office for the first time in our history, I suspect that pausing aid to Ukraine for a few weeks is pretty far down the list. That's not exactly ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" And that's especially true when we're just months away from the election that will let Americans make their own choice. Indeed, Americans are already voting to select the president's Democratic challenger. Why not let the voters decide whether the president ought to be removed?
The Democrats' real answer is that they're afraid they'll lose again in 2020, so they designed impeachment to hurt the president before the election. As one Democratic congressman said last year, ""I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president, he will get reelected."" Or as Minority Leader Chuck Schumer claimed earlier this month, impeachment is a ""win-win"" for Democrats; either it will lead to the president's defeat or it will hurt enough Republican senators in tough races to hand Democrats the majority. Or maybe both.
The political purpose of impeachment was clear from the manner in which House Democrats conducted their proceedings. If impeachment was indeed the high-minded, somber affair that Speaker Nancy Pelosi claimed, House Democrats would've taken their time to get all the facts from all relevant witnesses. Instead, they barreled ahead with a slipshod and secretive process, denying the president's due-process rights, gathering testimony behind closed doors, leaking their findings selectively to the press, and ignoring constitutional concerns such as executive privilege.
The impeachment vote itself contradicted the pretensions of House Democrats. Speaker Pelosi said last year that she wouldn't support impeachment unless there was something ""so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan"" that it demanded a response. Likewise, Congressman Jerry Nadler said that the House had to ""persuade enough of the opposition party voters"" before it voted to impeach. Democrats failed on both counts. Indeed, the only bipartisan aspect of the whole proceeding is that both Republicans and Democrats voted against impeaching the president. Not a single Republican voted for either article of impeachment in the House, resulting in the first party-line impeachment of a president in our nation's history.
So instead of doing their work, House Democrats simply impeached the president and declared their job complete. Yet after piously declaring the urgency of this impeachment, they waited a month to send the articles over to the Senate. Maybe they had to wait for the gold-encrusted souvenir pens to arrive for Speaker Pelosi's ""signing ceremony.""
And once in the Senate, the political theater continued. The House Democrats repeatedly asserted a bizarre logical fallacy: their case was both ""overwhelming"" and in need of more evidence. Yet we heard from seventeen witnesses—all hand-selected by the House Democrats—and received more than 28,000 pages of documents. The House could've pursued more witnesses during its impeachment, yet it instead chose to rush ahead rather than subpoena those witnesses or litigate issues in federal court. In fact, when one of the House's potential witnesses asked a federal court to rule on the issue, the House withdrew its subpoena and asked to dismiss the case. The House Democrats complain that the courts would've taken too long, yet they expected the Senate to delay our work to finish theirs. And in a final, remarkable stunt, Congressman Adam Schiff suggested that we depose witnesses—only his, of course, not the president's—with Chief Justice Roberts ruling on all questions of evidence and privilege, dragging him into this political spectacle.
But the curtain will soon come down on this political theater. The Senate will perform the role intended for us by the Founders, of providing the ""cool and deliberate sense of the community,"" as it says in Federalist 63, over and against an inflamed and transient House majority. Were we to do otherwise, were the Senate to acquiesce to the House, this process might have dragged on for many weeks, even for months, shutting down the normal legislative business of Congress even longer than it already has.
Even worse, by legitimizing the House's flawed, partisan impeachment, we would be setting a grave precedent for the future. Just consider how many times we heard about the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson during this trial. The Founders didn't intend impeachment as a tool to check the executive over policy disagreements or out of political spite. And the House has never before used impeachment in this way. Not when the Democrats claimed that President George W. Bush misled the country into the Iraq War or when President Barack Obama broke the law by releasing terrorists from Guantanamo Bay in return for the release of an American deserter, Bowe Bergdahl. Indeed, the Republican House did not impeach President Obama for, yes, withholding aid from Ukraine for three full years.
No House in the future should lead the country down this path again. By refusing to do this House's dirty work, the Senate is stopping this dangerous precedent and preserving the Founders' understanding that Congress ought to restrain the executive through the many checks and balances still at our disposal. More fundamentally, we're preserving the most important check of all—an election. It's time to teach that lesson to this House and to all future Houses, of both parties.
Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff have failed, but the American people lost. Now it's time to get back to doing the people's business.

It happened. 52 Republicans just voted to acquit Donald Trump in his impeachment trial.
The American people expect public servants to do right by them, uphold the rule of law, and protect the country from the high crimes and misdemeanors of a corrupt president. So while this may not be surprising, the failure of Senate Republicans to convict Donald Trump isn't any less disappointing.
Today was a sad day for our democracy. It's on us now to hold Donald Trump accountable, just like it's on us to elect public servants who won't let the American people down when it matters the most. Chip in $15 to take a firm stand against Senate GOP-approved corruption.

Alex,
The election is now just weeks away, and your actions in the coming days will be crucial for our success in November.
The good news is that, according to FiveThirtyEight, The New York Times’s release of Donald Trump’s tax history and business dealings has a “real potential to prevent Trump from making up ground on Joe Biden” \-- and Biden has continued to lead in national polls.
But FiveThirtyEight also reports that Trump’s strong polling on the economy could sway independent voters in critical states his way, which would give Trump the advantage as the election nears \-- just as it did in 2016 when independent voters in Florida, Michigan, and Wisconsin voted for Trump over Hillary Clinton on the economy, handing Trump the Electoral College by razor-thin margins.
We know from experience that Trump can rewrite the narrative on his tax crimes to win this election \-- like he did in 2016 when he overcame Clinton’s sizable polling leads to win the Electoral College. Our mission is to turn out Democratic voters in overwhelming numbers this election to exile Trump from the White House, take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell’s Republican majority, and expand our own House majority.
But the Trump campaign is now investing heavily in digital ads to turn out Trump’s supporters, outspending the Biden campaign by nearly $100 million. And The Hill now reports Democrats are worried “there might be a larger number of voters receptive to Trump’s...messaging than they’re seeing in the polls.” That’s why, with just a few weeks to go before the election, we can’t afford to fall behind on our fundraising goal \-- but that’s exactly what we’re doing right now.
Our work has always relied on the support of committed Democrats like you who are ready to fight against Trump’s far-right agenda. That’s why we’re reaching out now to ask for your support as we mobilize to turn out voters in this critical time. If we’re going to defeat Trump in November, take back the Senate, and expand our House majority, then we need you to donate now to turn out every single eligible Democrat and exile Trump from Washington.
We cannot thank you enough for standing with us now.

Schumer said Trump’s actions were “appalling” and “an abuse of presidential power” \-- causing Mitch McConnell’s ears to perk up.
McConnell, who’s helped the president get away with abuse of power before, jumped at the chance to do so again \-- blocking the resolution and calling it an indulgence in Democrats’ “myopic obsession with President Trump.”
Maybe McConnell thinks his life would be easier if Americans simply paid no attention to Donald Trump and his crimes.

NPR: “Top congressional Democrats are calling for a federal investigation after a nurse who worked at an immigration detention center in Georgia filed a whistleblower complaint alleging a lack of medical care and unsafe work practices that facilitated the spread of COVID-19. She also says that immigrant women received questionable hysterectomies.”
ICE has a history of committing human rights abuses while emboldened under the Trump administration \-- first separating families at the border, then leaving migrant children in cages, and now, allegations have surfaced that a doctor in an ICE detention center performed mass hysterectomies on unknowing migrant women without their consent.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is demanding an investigative briefing on these alleged crimes by the end of the week \-- stating: “this profoundly disturbing situation recalls some of the darkest moments of our nation’s history.” But ICE officials are denying any fault.
Since Trump’s election, we’ve seen a rise in xenophobia and hate crimes targeting immigrants and communities of color. Despite mounting evidence of abuse taking place in detention centers across the country, Trump has praised ICE as “compassionate” and said if centers are too crowded, “tell them not to come to the USA.” Another four years of Trump’s inhumane leadership will completely erase the values this country was founded on, but nearly 50% of Americans approve of Trump’s immigration policy. Today we need to know, do you?

After rounding up protestors in Portland, President Trump is now sending federal law enforcement officers to Chicago.
Trump claims the city needs the surge to combat rising crime rates \-- but he is really using Chicago to drum up support for his re-election prospects.
Since his 2016 campaign, Trump has tried to scare voters into supporting him \-- painting himself as the only thing standing between them and high crime rates.
With a high number of shootings in communities of color, Chicago has become a popular target for Trump.

What is Obamagate, exactly?
No one has any idea, but Donald Trump can’t stop tweeting about it. According to Trump, Barack Obama is guilty of “the biggest political crime and scandal in the history of the USA, by FAR.”
Trump can’t quite say what that crime is. But he knows Obama is to blame. And, unlike when Trump touted racist conspiracy theories about Obama being born in Kenya, now Trump has the power of the chief executive and Obama doesn’t.
And Trump’s using it. To plan a show trial for the 44th president. He just demanded on Twitter that Lindsey Graham bring Obama before the GOP-controlled Senate to testify like an accused criminal.
Barack Obama once said of his position: “I am president, I am not king.” Looks like Trump disagrees. What do you think?
Should Obama answer Trump's charges?
YES NO

Donald Trump has sent federal law enforcement to numerous American cities to, as he claims, restore law and order.
According to POLITICO, polls show that these recent political stunts haven’t exactly connected with their target audience: suburban voters.
Suburban voters seem to be rejecting Trump’s frequent warnings that a Joe Biden presidency would bring crime and mayhem \-- and rejecting Trump’s own use of force in cities such as Portland and Chicago.
Now, just like in the 2018 election, Trump and the GOP face the prospect of a suburban blue wave of Democratic voters.
However, there are three months left to Election Day \-- and Trump and the GOP will not go quietly.
Even during the blue wave of 2018, Republicans were able to win key Senate and gubernatorial races due to voter suppression \-- and they’ve committed $20 million to block voting rights before November this year.
And things were also looking good for Hillary Clinton before the 2016 election \-- before voter apathy and suppression handed Trump the White House.
That’s why we need you to commit today to voting for Joe Biden this November. Let us know now:
Are you voting for Joe Biden in November?
YES NO
We cannot win without your input now.

Attorney General Bill Barr has said that, no matter what Donald Trump wants, he won’t use the justice system to organize a show trial for former president Barack Obama \-- with Barr saying, “As long as I’m attorney general, the criminal justice system will not be used for partisan political ends.”
Trump, on the other hand, doubled down on his accusations \-- saying Obama should be made to testify before Congress as part of Trump’s claim that the former president committed “the biggest political crime in American history,” even though Trump can’t say what that crime is.
It looks like, for now, Trump’s cabinet is standing up to him. But the last time an Attorney General wouldn’t go along with Trump’s wishes, Trump fired him and replaced him with someone who would. If Trump does the same thing again, then President Obama could be forced to testify before a GOP-controlled Senate. That’s why we need to know, now:

President Trump is ranting on Twitter again. And, unfortunately, some of his latest tweets were racist.
In one tweet, Trump criticized NASCAR’s decision to ban the Confederate flag. He also called for Bubba Wallace, NASCAR’s only black driver, to apologize for an incident that the organization thought was a hate crime. The FBI later determined no crime was committed \-- and though the situation was not Wallace’s fault, the president still felt the need to belittle the driver on Twitter.
Next, Trump attacked Washington’s pro football team and the Cleveland Indians baseball team for starting discussions on changing their names away from Native American themes. For good measure, Trump ended his tweet by mocking Elizabeth Warren, a frequent target of his racial insults.
As Americans of all walks of life take to the streets to push for racial justice, we need leadership that can unite the country and help bring about an end to systemic racism. Instead, President Trump regularly helps to fan the flames of racial tension with his racist rhetoric on social media. We, as a nation, deserve better. Tell us:
Do you condemn the president's racism?
YES NO

Recently, progressive icon Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made a statement tying poverty and unemployment to the uptick in crime throughout communities in New York City during the pandemic.
Republican Rep. Ted Yoho, who has never had a conversation with Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez before, accosted her on the Capitol steps, calling her “disgusting,” a “fucking bitch,” and told her, “You are out of your freaking mind.”
Several congressmen have spoken out against Yoho’s outbursts, including Rep. Dean Phillips, who tweeted, “Like @aoc, I believe poverty to be a root cause of crime. Wonder why Rep. Yoho hasn’t accosted me on the Capitol steps with the same sentiment?”
We know that GOP leaders like Florida Rep. Ted Yoho are scared of powerful women like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \-- and that they would never disrespect a congressional representative in the same manner. We’re appalled by the blatant sexism espoused by leaders who walk through our nation's capital each day \-- and at A Woman’s Place, we stand by Rep. Ocasio-Cortez. Today, we hope you will, too.

129,"Hi Alex,
The Hill’s political consultant Douglas Schoen recently warned that the “presidential race is much closer than many now think” as Joe Biden’s lead narrows across battleground states. Tightening national polls prove we will need an overwhelming vote to beat Trump in November, but in 2016, nearly 100 million voters stayed home and handed a misogynist four years in the White House.
Since then, we’ve seen a surge of anti-women legislation attacking our reproductive rights and access to health care, experienced nearly 200,000 American deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic, witnessed increasing hate crimes against communities of color and, most recently, overt attempts by the Trump administration to suppress the vote.
But this year, we have the power to change the path our country is on.
Women are a powerhouse in the U.S. electorate, currently accounting for Joe Biden’s lead in national polling. And there are a record number of progressive women running for office this year who are demanding our new leadership fight for families, racial justice, health care, and reproductive rights.
That’s why we’re determined to help as many progressive women as we can run successful campaigns, reach new voters, and create the diverse, representative government we’ve envisioned. But as election day approaches, the GOP is spending millions in key states across the country while running an aggressive campaign against vote-by-mail, a method over 50% of Democrats will use to turn in their ballots. And right now, we’re $2,491 short of where we need to be to endorse as many candidates as possible before this month’s FEC filing deadline.
Our country is at a turning point, and you play a crucial role in protecting Democratic control of the House, taking back the Senate, and electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris into the White House.
We have just 45 days left to vote Trump out of office and elect women who will fight for progressive policies and restore the values that will move our country forward. Can we count on you to contribute $5, $10, $25, or anything you can right now to ensure we elect leaders who will protect reproductive rights, champion racial equity, and defend affordable healthcare come November?
Thank you for joining our efforts to break the systemic barriers that keep women out of power and elect leadership we can be proud of.

Federal agents tear gassed the mayor of Portland after he spoke in solidarity with people protesting. They have brutally attacked and abducted citizens off the streets, throwing them into unmarked vehicles, and destroyed medical supplies.
Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and public health scientist at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, spoke out stating, ""This is Fubar. The Geneva Convention states that destroying medical equipment is a war crime violation. Yet, here we are in Portland. Attacking medical units violates half a dozen conventions and international statutes. Not only the Geneva Convention, but also International Criminal Court statutes. But hey, Chad Wolf, Bill Barr, and Trump say it’s okay!""
Now, the president plans to deploy the agents into more cities across the country to stop the righteous protests of citizens seeking justice. Right now, we need to hear from you in our new survey to see where you stand:
Do you condemn Donald Trump?

131,"Hi Alex,
Today, the House voted to impeach the president for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. I fully understand the seriousness of these charges and the vote our leaders just took.
Like our Democratic leaders, I agree that the president is guilty of abusing the vast powers of the office of the President and obstruction of Congress’s oversight abilities, and that these qualify as high crimes and misdemeanors that the Constitution, as laid out by our forefathers, identifies as grounds for impeachment.
Unlike our current representative, Brian Fitzpatrick, who did not have the courage to defy his party and do what’s right for the American people and our country, I would have been a strong “yes” vote to impeach the president today.
This is a somber day for the United States, but today’s vote was critical in making it clear that no one \-- not even the president \-- is above the law.
We have important fights ahead of us.

132,"Dear Patriot,
What an interesting time we are living in today. We are seeing leaders in the Democrat party calling the rioters destroying our cities ""peaceful protestors."" We are seeing Democratic Mayors refusing to accept help from the National Guard to quell riots in their cities. We’ve seen Kamala Harris urge protesters to not let up and encourage her supporters to help bail out the rioters, while Joe Biden’s campaign staff were also quick to donate to support the rioters. Meanwhile, D.C.’s Democratic Mayor, Muriel Bowser, has recommended renaming, relocating, or contextualizing nearly 50 DC sites, including the Washington Monument, Jefferson Memorial, Benjamin Franklin Statue, and many more.
If you want to know what a true Democratic takeover of Washington would look like, look no further than the Virginia General Assembly.
Just last week, left-wing Democratic delegates not only proposed cutting state police funding by 25% but also made an outlandish proposal in support of banning School Resource Officers schools across the Commonwealth.
In a further power trip, the Democrat-controlled Senate passed a bill—under the guise of fighting voter fraud—that actually allows “community organizers” to go door-to-door collecting live voter ballots and taking them to their base of operations before forwarding them to the ballot box.
What’s more, the House Courts of Justice Committee voted to advance House Bill 5148, to permit early release of prisoners for crimes including murder, rape, child pornography, cross burning and other forms of racial intimidation, domestic violence, and child prostitution.
A contribution of $5, $25, $50, or more from you today will help us to stop these preposterous ideas from spreading to Washington.
From stacking the ballot box to defunding the police, these are exactly the types of policies that my leftist opponent—Qasim Rashid—is eager to push in Washington. That’s why we must fight harder than ever to keep this seat red!
We can't afford another two years of Nancy Pelosi and her socialist lackeys in power. We need to fire Nancy Pelosi. And, we need your support to do this.
Can I count on you to chip in $50, $100, $250, $500 or even $1,000 today to help continue our grassroots success?
Your donation of any amount today will help us fight back against the lies the Democratic establishment is spreading!

* Leading the charge to hold Attorney General Barr accountable for his many crimes against the American people including corruption and obstruction of justice.
* Standing with residents of Washington, D.C. as he voted to make our nation’s capital a state and give due representation to the hundreds of thousands of citizens who live here.
* Fighting back against President Trump’s callous disregard for working class families by demanding an extension to unemployment benefits for those who are struggling during this pandemic.
Hank has been so busy this month, we’ve fallen behind on our fundraising goal! That’s why we are putting together a plan to catch up on our fundraising goal, and it starts with asking our grassroots supporters to chip in $10 or $20.

You read that right —
A sitting United States Senator…
In the year 2020…
Amidst a nationwide reckoning over our fraught history with racial injustice…
Outrageously claimed that slavery was a “necessary evil.” We’re at a loss for words.
Hank has come across some bad apples throughout his time in Congress, but Senator Tom Cotton may have taken the crown with these egregious comments. Will you chip in to support Hank so he can keep standing up to Tom Cotton and holding him accountable for his hideous words?
HOLD TOM COTTON ACCOUNTABLE
Alex, let’s be clear — slavery was a crime against humanity that will forever be a stain on our nation’s legacy, not a “necessity” as Senator Cotton suggests.
Not only is Tom Cotton on the wrong side of history with his comments, he’s thoroughly tone-deaf to the discussions of racial justice happening across the country. After all, an op-ed that he penned had to be pulled by the New York Times after he called for the military to send in the troops to quell peaceful protests.
Now normally, we’d highlight Tom Cotton’s opponent and do everything we can to help send him back home to Arkansas. But without a credible challenger in his election, Tom Cotton is staying in Washington — and that means it’s up to leaders like Hank to hold him accountable.
Tom Cotton’s gross simplification and diminishment of the sin of slavery isn’t just wrong — it’s dangerous. And he must be held accountable. Will you chip in to support Hank’s work to do just that?

Now it's been a few days since President Trump’s January 2nd airstrike on Qasem Soleimani, it has become plainly clear that this attack was ill-conceived and has made everyday Americans less safe.
This reckless move — made without consultation with Congress or support from our allies abroad — has already had chaotic consequences. Iran has announced that they will be enriching more uranium in violation of the 2015 nuclear agreement, the Iraqi Parliament has taken steps to expel American troops from their country, and Iran has threatened to strike back at US military targets.
And the aftermath of this situation has been made worse by Donald Trump’s continued erratic behavior. Trump has threatened Iran with violent war crimes, and refused to communicate with Congressional leaders — proclaiming on Twitter that his bizarre tweets serve as “notification to the United States Congress.”
I want to boost some additional digital ads calling out Donald Trump for this reckless, dangerous behavior, but we need to expand our advertising budget. Will you chip $10, $20 or whatever you can so we can make sure voters across Georgia and the country are up to speed on this situation?
CONTRIBUTE NOW
Alex -- the foreign policy of this administration has been an abject failure. From withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords to throwing the 2015 nuclear agreement in the trash, our moves on the world stage these past three years have had more to do with Donald Trump’s personal insecurities than this country’s national security.
If we’re going to win in 2020, we have to make sure everyday Georgians know about Trump’s disastrous foreign policy record. Will you make a contribution to my campaign today so we can add additional digital advertisements that educate voters on this President’s reckless conduct abroad?
Thank you,

Did you see the news? Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser, was arrested and charged with FRAUD for the “Build the Wall” GoFundMe scam.
This is just another example of Trump’s corruption and how he has surrounded himself with crooks and criminals -- and their behavior is all enabled by the rogue Attorney General, Bill Barr.
While Trump calls himself the president of “law and order”, it’s clear that he and his cronies believe they’re above the law. We cannot afford four more years of criminal activity in the White House, and we can’t afford to have any enablers of this behavior in Congress.
I’m running for re-election to stand up against this lawlessness. Could you send over a donation to my campaign so I can keep fighting in Congress to hold all of these people and their enablers accountable for their crimes?
DONATE NOW >>
It is truly disturbing how many Trump associates have been arrested, charged and found guilty of crimes -- from Paul Manafort to Rick Gates, Michael Flynn and now Steve Bannon? And somehow they all seem to be getting sweetheart deals courtesy of AG William Barr... We must defeat this corruption and bring decency back.
I’m appalled that people so close to the White House and president have been involved in so many criminal activities. This is insulting to the office of the president, and insulting to the people of America who want leaders that surround themselves with good, decent people.
We have choices to make when it comes to the leaders we want to represent us in Congress, and in the White House. Having criminals in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue who are enriching themselves for personal gain or lying to cover up the president’s crimes cannot stand.
Please make a contribution to my campaign today if you can -- every dollar counts and will help re-elect me to represent Georgia’s 4th district once again, and I couldn’t be prouder to stand with you and against this corruption.

Subject: Team, our freedom is at stake:
To: Carole Mumford
Hi everyone. I’m finding it increasingly difficult to deny that our nation is in the grip of a slow-moving coup d’etat and that our very freedom is at stake. Let me get you up to speed:
President Trump took the Presidency after encouraging, then accepting and benefiting from Russian interference in the 2016 election. Roger Stone was intimately involved in that collusion. So was Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort. Today they are all convicted felons.
As you may remember, these criminal associates were only brought to justice because former Attorney General Jeff Sessions lied about his own Russian contacts. So he recused himself from the investigation and appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Putin’s scheme to help Trump steal the election. President Trump was always furious about this decision, and wanted a new Attorney General who would kowtow to his corrupt demands. Well, when he appointed William Barr he got his man.
* AG Barr withheld the Mueller report from Congress while misstating its conclusions in a successful effort to mislead the public.
* AG Barr disparaged and cast doubt on a Office of Inspector General (OIG) report that claimed there were sufficient grounds to investigate the Trump campaign.
* AG Barr downplayed the impact Russia had on the election, saying that the FBI under President Obama was a greater threat than Russian inference.
And now, dear friends, it’s getting even worse. It is clear that every time President Trump gets away with a crime, he becomes emboldened and commits an even more egregious one. For example:
* The day after Mueller's testimony before the House Judiciary Committee about his report, President Trump made the “perfect” phone call to President Zelensky seeking Ukrainian assistance to help him get re-elected, using $391 million in desperately needed security assistance as leverage to force Ukrainian compliance with his demands.
* And now, after being acquitted by the Senate in a sham “trial” rigged by Moscow Mitch, Donald Trump is taking a “victory lap” by purging all those witnesses who dared stand against him and is trying to free cronies like Roger Stone and Michael Flynn.
Through all of this, AG William Barr has been subverting justice to help Donald Trump every step of the way. Barr is using his position to help shield Stone and Flynn from their just punishment -- to public applause from the President!
If Barr gets away with helping Trump’s friends, he will use his position to punish Trump’s enemies for exercising their constitutional rights. Our very freedom, my brothers and sisters, is under attack!
That’s why I am renewing calls for everyday Americans to sign on to my petition demanding that AG Barr resign. It’s clear this is going to be a long fight, but the more grassroots supporters I have by my side the harder I can fight for justice. If you haven’t signed, will you step up for our democracy today and add your name?

As an impeachment manager in the trial for federal Judge Thomas Porteous in 2010, Hank was able to give special insight into the process going on in the Senate right now. If you haven’t seen it, watch here →
The impeachment trial that Hank managed actually bears some resemblance to the current trial of President Trump. Judge Porteous, like President Trump, hadn’t been convicted of any crime and claimed that his misdeeds didn’t rise to the level of impeachment.
But he was still removed from office in an overwhelming vote. The same standard should be held to President Trump, and it’s up to us to make that happen. Will you chip in a grassroots donation so Hank can keep speaking truth to power and holding Trump accountable?

The President of the United States has run a concentrated campaign to get his buddy Michael Flynn off the hook for lying to the Federal Bureau of Intelligence (FBI) about conversations he had with Russian government officials -- and unfortunately, as of yesterday, it worked.
The Department of Justice (or should I say, the Department of Injustice) announced their intentions to drop all charges against Michael Flynn.
(This isn’t the first time that Donald Trump has meddled in the legal system for his political pals -- he managed to get his friend Roger Stone a reduced sentence after public lobbying as well.)
Alex -- Let me be clear: this is a disgrace. It is a disgrace that someone who pleaded guilty -- someone who admitted they committed the crime -- to providing false information to the FBI about his conversations with a foreign power has gotten off scot free because they are cronies of the President.
And Attorney General William Barr has been aiding and abetting Donald Trump every step of the way. When questioned about why someone who pleaded guilty was being let off the hook, Barr went on CBS News to say that “people sometimes plead to things that turn out not to be crimes” \-- it makes absolutely no sense.
Will you join me in standing up to this Department of Injustice, Alex? Will you sign my petition demanding that William Barr resign and that integrity get restored to our Justice Department? We’ve gotten thousands of signatures on past petitions calling on Barr to resign, but this new offense requires reinvigorated grassroots action to DEMAND change.
It is clear that integrity does not come naturally to this administration, so we must join together to demand it.
In solidarity,
Hank

Today is a special day set aside to give recognition to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. — and truthfully, this is a particularly important year to reflect on Dr. King’s movement and legacy.
These are perilous times. The most powerful people in the land are willing to go to unprecedented lengths to maintain their grip on power, and to cover up their crimes when they get caught. But even in our darkest moments, Dr. King reminded us that the dawn will come.
That doesn’t mean we can be complacent, Alex. Unlike the dawn, the change won’t come on its own.
In Dr. King’s final speech, he discussed the story of the Good Samaritan. So it goes, a traveler gets robbed and left injured on the side of the road, and countless people then pass by without lending a hand. Dr. King considers all the reasons that those people may have had for walking past, all the logical reasons they may have had not to act, summarizing those explanations in the fearful question: “If I stop to help this man, what will happen to me?""
Dr. King then explains: “But then the Good Samaritan came by, and he reversed the question. ‘If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him?’""
To live up to Dr. King’s legacy, we must look at our country’s challenges through this lens he presented in his last speech.
We must complete the census. We must register voters. We must do service work in our communities. We must stay engaged in the political process even when it is stressful and frustrating.
Why? Because if we do not, what will happen to our country?
So I encourage all of you to stay hopeful, optimistic, and engaged. And step-by-step we will continue to bend the arc of this nation closer to the dream that Martin Luther King Jr. shared with all of us.
Yours,
Hank

Team,
Now that it's been a few days since President Trump’s January 2nd airstrike on Qasem Soleimani, it has become plainly clear that this attack was ill-conceived and has made everyday Americans less safe.
This reckless move — made without consultation with Congress or support from our allies abroad — has already had chaotic consequences. Iran has announced that they will be enriching more uranium in violation of the 2015 nuclear agreement, the Iraqi Parliament has taken steps to expel American troops from their country, and Iran has threatened to strike back at US military targets.
And the aftermath of this situation has been made worse by Donald Trump’s continued erratic behavior. Trump has threatened Iran with violent war crimes, and refused to communicate with Congressional leaders — proclaiming on Twitter that his bizarre tweets serve as “notification to the United States Congress.”
I want to boost some additional digital ads calling out Donald Trump for this reckless, dangerous behavior, but we need to expand our advertising budget. Will you chip $10, $20 or whatever you can so we can make sure voters across Georgia and the country are up to speed on this situation?

Folks -- the foreign policy of this administration has been an abject failure. From withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords to throwing the 2015 nuclear agreement in the trash, our moves on the world stage these past three years have had more to do with Donald Trump’s personal insecurities than this country’s national security.
If we’re going to win in 2020, we have to make sure everyday Georgians know about Trump’s disastrous foreign policy record. Will you make a contribution to my campaign today so we can add additional digital advertisements that educate voters on this President’s reckless conduct abroad?

142,"Alex — Did you hear about the fiery confrontation that happened on the steps of the U.S. Capitol?
AOC accosted by GOP lawmaker: The Hill
Trump lackey Rep. Ted Yoho tried to bully Rep. Ocasio-Cortez in a sexist, profanity-laced tirade.
He even got up in her face and wagged his pudgy finger and called her “disgusting” and “rude.” The irony is not lost on us.
Alex, as Americans, we will often disagree. Members of Congress have a responsibility to the citizens we serve to find consensus, and when we do disagree, to treat each other with dignity and respect. But what Rep. Yoho said crossed the line — using vile language to attack the young Congresswoman (that we choose not to dignify by repeating), as well as calling her “disgusting” and “out of her freaking mind.”
This was a shameful display of disrespect against one of his own colleagues, and he’s yet to properly and directly address his wrongs. Will you join us in condemning this atrocious behavior and demanding Rep. Yoho apologize?
CONDEMN TED YOHO’S REMARKS
This isn’t the first time colleagues in Congress have disagreed on the issues. In fact, there’s plenty of civil disagreement when people care so passionately about the policies at hand. Rep. Yoho’s response came from a place of deep disrespect for the young Latina Congresswoman — it was inappropriate, dehumanizing and has no place in these hallowed halls of Congress.
Looking at the record, it seems like Mr. Yoho has some priorities to straighten out that might be a better use of his time than cursing out a sitting Congresswoman. After all, he was one of the four members of the House to vote AGAINST anti-lynching bill named in Emmet Till’s memory.
He voted down the bill that would make lynching a federal hate crime because it was an, “overreach of the federal government and tramples on states rights.” Hmm, where have we heard that before?
Rep. Ted Yoho has got a lot to work on, the easiest of which is crafting a meaningful and impactful apology to AOC. Will you condemn his abhorrent remarks alongside Hank and other Congressional Democrats and demand an apology by adding your name?

143,"Hi Alex. I’m finding it increasingly difficult to deny that our nation is in the grip of a slow-moving coup d’etat and that our very freedom is at stake. Let me get you up to speed:
President Trump took the Presidency after encouraging, then accepting and benefiting from Russian interference in the 2016 election. Roger Stone was intimately involved in that collusion. So was Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort. Today they are all convicted felons.
As you may remember, these criminal associates were only brought to justice because former Attorney General Jeff Sessions lied about his own Russian contacts. So he recused himself from the investigation and appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Putin’s scheme to help Trump steal the election. President Trump was always furious about this decision, and wanted a new Attorney General who would kowtow to his corrupt demands. Well, when he appointed William Barr he got his man.
* AG Barr withheld the Mueller report from Congress while misstating its conclusions in a successful effort to mislead the public.
* AG Barr disparaged and cast doubt on a Office of Inspector General (OIG) report that claimed there were sufficient grounds to investigate the Trump campaign.
* AG Barr downplayed the impact Russia had on the election, saying that the FBI under President Obama was a greater threat than Russian inference.
And now, Alex, it’s getting even worse. It is clear that every time President Trump gets away with a crime, he becomes emboldened and commits an even more egregious one. For example:

144,"Alex -- This is a total trashing of the rule of law:
Late last night, President Trump announced that he was commuting Roger Stone’s sentence and that Mr. Stone would not face a single day of jail time.
Roger Stone lied to Congress to protect Donald Trump. Now, Donald Trump is using his powers as President of the United States to keep his dirty trickster out of prison.
Will you stand with us to fight back and defend our rule of law? >>
When peaceful protestors are in the streets demanding racial equality, Donald Trump rants and raves about “law and order,” but when his buddies are found guilty of serious crimes, apparently “law and order” doesn’t apply.
As if there were still any doubt, this crooked kickback proves that the rule of law of this country will never apply to this so-called President.
But while Donald Trump is the perpetrator of this particular graft, he is not the only one who is guilty.
Congressional Republicans had their chance to stop Donald Trump’s corruption by convicting him and removing him from office during impeachment hearings this year. Every single one of them, with the exception of Senator Romney, failed in their duty.
They have enabled and allowed abuses like the commutation of Roger Stone to take place. And so it’s up to us to send the message that nobody is above the law. Not Donald Trump. Not Roger Stone. Nobody.

NOW: The Lake County Board of Elections has confirmed that the GOP’s claim is 100% FALSE and Hillary didn’t vote in Ohio for the 2008 election. But we haven’t seen a retraction or an apology, so it’s safe to say they’re sticking to their guns on this lie.

Steve Chabot for Congress
Friend,
I’m sure you’ve heard by now, but early this morning, Nancy Pelosi made a surprise announcement that radical Democrats in Washington will move forward with impeaching our president.
Pelosi has taken the left’s impeachment hysteria to a new level, officially recommending that the House introduce articles of impeachment…
Pelosi claims her decision was based on “facts,” but as someone who participated in yesterday’s Judiciary Committee hearing, I can tell you with complete certainty: the Democrats’ arguments are VOID of facts.
I am fighting hard to defend our president and I need you by my side.
The Democrats’ impeachment agenda has officially crossed a line.
By moving to recommend articles of impeachment based on nothing but a desire to undo the results of the 2016 election, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff are abusing a power reserved in our Constitution for the most serious of crimes.
It’s up to us to send a message loud and clear that we DO NOT SUPPORT their politically-motivated witch hunt, and that WE HAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP’S BACK!
I WILL DEFEND PRESIDENT TRUMP
I DO NOT SUPPORT IMPEACHMENT
Think about what this means for the future of our country. We can’t allow impeachment to become the go-to weapon to remove someone we dislike from office.
As I said yesterday, President Trump is going to serve out his term and be elected to another one. But to get there, he needs your help to beat this shameful impeachment effort: [[URL REDACTED]]
Will you join me in defending President Trump?

## Chabot: Choose prosperity over dangerous policies
Steve Chabot, Opinion contributor

By any measure, 2020 has been a challenging year for everyone – not just here, but across the globe. But, as Americans always do, we’re finding ways to persevere, even in the face of unprecedented obstacles.
No challenge has been greater than the COVID-19 pandemic. Faced with a novel virus we didn’t even know existed a year ago, we had to act quickly to find a way to slow the spread of the virus.
Significant portions of our economy were shut down to deal with the virus’ initial onslaught, and give medical professionals time to learn more about treating it. Those critical efforts likely saved hundreds of thousands of lives.
But the economic impact of the pandemic required swift action from Congress to help the American people survive this unprecedented period in our history. Fortunately, we acted quickly, and in a bipartisan manner, to enact three major pieces of legislation to: increase testing capacity; provide health care providers the resources they needed to treat patients and protect their staffs; send billions to local governments to help them confront the virus; and provide relief directly to the American people.
As the top Republican on the House Small Business Committee, I worked closely with Democratic Chairwoman Nydia Velazquez from New York, and our Senate counterparts, to help small businesses survive the pandemic. The result, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), has helped save millions of jobs across the country. In the 1st Congressional District, more small businesses received loans (over 17,000) for more money (nearly $3 billion), and most importantly, we saved more jobs (256,000) than any other district in Ohio.
The program’s been extremely successful, but our small businesses need additional support. That’s why I’ve been pushing to reopen the program, place a greater emphasis on the smallest of small businesses, and allow a second loan to those businesses still struggling to survive. It is why I’ve visited more then 70 small businesses in recent weeks, to listen to their concerns, learn how we can improve the PPP program and see what else I can do to help. Especially, with the recent surge in COVID-19 cases, we need to make sure small business owners have the support they need to make it through this crisis.
The good news is the economy is rebounding. Millions of jobs lost early in the pandemic have come back, and the economy grew by a robust 7.4% in the third quarter. We still have a ways to go, but we’re exceeding many expectations as we rebuild from the initial shock of the pandemic.
Obviously, the other major challenge we face is improving police-community relations following the inexcusable and horrific death of George Floyd in Minnesota. In response, I introduced common-sense reforms to improve police-community relations, help weed out any bad apples in the police force, and make our neighborhoods safer.
That’s why I’ve been endorsed by the Cincinnati Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), and the Democratic Sheriff of Hamilton County, Jim Neil. They know I’ll work with both police, and community leaders, to make sure our neighborhoods are safe, and every citizen, regardless of race or ethnicity, is treated with respect by the police.
My opponent, on the other hand, would make our neighborhoods less safe. She refused to condemn efforts to defund our police, would get rid of cash bail, and she’d allow police officers to be sued for simply doing their jobs.
Further, she hampered our COVID-19 response by running up a $2.7 million deficit at the Cincinnati Board of Health and embroiled the board in an ""unethical"" hiring scandal.
And she’d crush our economy by supporting the radical Green New Deal, which would cost $93 trillion, kill millions of American jobs, and even pay people who refuse to work. Shockingly, she has repeatedly declared that ""nothing else matters"" – even as our communities battle a pandemic.
And so in this election, the choice is clear. We can choose my opponent’s dangerous agenda, and head down the path towards higher taxes, job-killing socialist programs, and more crime in our communities.
Or we can focus on defeating COVID-19, continuing to restore American prosperity, standing up for our small businesses and making our communities safer for every family. If you agree these should be our priorities and that our elected leaders should focus on delivering results for you, I’d appreciate your vote.

Councilman/Retired USMC Colonel Greg Raths
Votes to Fully Fund Mission Viejo Police Services
Mission Viejo Council Unanimously Votes for Police Services Contract
Orange County, CA (June 11, 2020) – Colonel Greg Raths, USMC (Ret.), a Mission Viejo Councilman, joined with his Council colleagues to approve the city’s FY 2020-21 $20.1 million contract for police services with the Orange County Sheriff’s Department. The contract adds patrols to Mission Viejo schools to protect students, teachers, and school staff.
Raths made the following statement:
“There is no question that George Floyd was murdered by Derek Chauvin, and the other three Minneapolis officers were complicit in this murder. Floyd did not deserve to be killed and certainly not in such brutal fashion. When I was in the United States Marine Corps, the Uniform Code of Military Justice was swift and fair because we knew the importance of punishing and stopping those who abused the awesome power entrusted to us by the American people.
“That being said, calls to defund the police are an overreaction by extremists in our country. The vast majority of police officers and sheriff’s deputies are noble public servants who put their lives on the line to protect the public from criminals and assist people in need of help. We should honor their brave service. We need to make sure our law enforcement have the resources they need to protect our community from crime and to serve our law-abiding residents.
“It is important to encourage innovative and community-based policing, which strengthens the relationship between law enforcement and the community. Defunding discourages innovation. In Mission Viejo, our newest Sheriff’s Department contract adds patrols to our schools to ensure that students, teachers, and staff are safer at school, and students are able to have positive interactions with Sheriff’s deputies. Recognizing the changing needs of our community, the council voted to retain a homeless liaison deputy who has special training on mental illness and will work to connect the homeless with services and resources.”
Colonel Greg Raths, USMC (Ret.) is serving his second term on the Mission Viejo City Council and is the former Mayor. A combat decorated fighter pilot, Greg flew 75 combat missions in Iraq, Kuwait, and Somalia flying the F/A-18 Hornet. He was later selected to serve in the prestigious White House Military Office as Chief of Staff. After retiring from the Marine Corps in 2004, he flew for Jet Blue Airways as a commercial airline pilot, and then went into business as president of an Orange County company. Greg currently serves as president of the Mission Viejo Rotary Club. He is the Vice Chairman of the Orange County Veterans Advisory Council.
Greg earned his master’s degree from National Defense University, bachelor’s degrees from Arizona State University and Cal State Fullerton, and associate’s degrees from Saddleback College and Phoenix College. Greg moved to Orange County in 1977 when he was assigned to the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. Married since 1982, Greg and Luci have three children and six grandchildren.

Councilman/Retired Colonel Greg Raths Endorsed by
Crime Survivors PAC for California’s 45th Congressional District
Orange County, CA (June 30, 2020) – Colonel Greg Raths, USMC (Ret.), a Mission Viejo Councilman, has received the endorsement of Crime Survivors PAC. He is the Republican nominee for the House of Representatives against freshman incumbent Representative Katie Porter (D-Irvine), who is endorsed by none of the mayors in the 45th District. The district has a 2.4% Republican registration advantage.
“As a retired U.S. Marine Colonel and decorated veteran, Greg Raths has demonstrated unparalleled experience in being a leader dedicated to American safety,” said Patricia Wenskunas, Founder and CEO of Crime Survivors, Inc. “The devotion that Raths has shown to the well-being of Orange County locals as both Mayor and City Council Member of Mission Viejo helped lead to a 27% reduction in crime.”
“I believe Orange County needs a leader like Greg Raths who puts an emphasis on the importance of keeping our cities a safe place to raise a family and thrive,” continued Wenskunas. “My gratitude for a principled and personable candidate like Greg Raths is immense and I fully endorse him in the race for California’s 45th Congressional District.”
“It is an honor to be endorsed by Patricia Wenskunas and Crime Survivors PAC, who are such strong advocates for standing up to criminals and standing up for the rights of crime victims,” said Raths. “I am grateful that they have recognized my record in protecting law-abiding citizens against harm by dangerous criminals.”

154,"New Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a major Trump donor, was installed to cause as much havoc as possible.
In a short time, he has instituted new policy changes designed to cripple the postal service’s ability to deliver mail-in ballots.
Meanwhile, Donald Trump is publicly admitting that he is attacking the postal service because he’s scared of mail-in ballots. That’s why I’m calling on DeJoy to resign or be fired, and it's also why House Democrats are back in session this week taking action to protect the USPS.

President Trump’s negligent mismanagement of COVID-19 is directly responsible for unnecessary deaths and conditions that make it unsafe for Americans to crowd together and vote.
That’s why his attack on mail-in ballots is so disgusting. It is nothing less than an attack on American democracy. All true patriots have a moral obligation to do everything we can to make sure that Donald Trump is voted out and held accountable for his many crimes.

Beyond his impressive voting record, Jerry also has been at the forefront of structural reform that expands the rights of women and fights structural sexism in all of its forms.
Last year, he introduced a bill ensuring pregnant women are afforded protection against workplace discrimination and led hearings to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.
Instead of simply relying on what had been done, Jerry pushed hard to ensure the new version included steps to strengthen legal protections for the LGBTQ+, Native Americans, and immigrant women.
He also worked to make it harder for people convicted of domestic violence crimes to acquire firearms and expanded grant funding for training and prevention programs.
We are proud to support Jerry Nadler as a champion for women’s rights. Join us by rushing a donation now!
Supporting women shouldn’t be a partisan issue, but all too often it is.
Republicans know their extreme base cares more about imposing their personal morality on the rest of us than actually upholding Constitutionally guaranteed freedoms. That’s why it’s important that we defend champions of women’s rights like Jerry.
Thank you for supporting women,

162,"Trump Commutes Sentence of Roger Stone, NYTimes
President Trump undermined the rule of law in America yet again by commuting the sentence of his campaign henchman Roger Stone.
To protect Donald Trump, Roger Stone threatened to harm witnesses to his crimes, lied to investigators, and was found guilty of obstruction of justice.
Therefore, what President Trump is doing is commuting the sentence of a man who obstructed justice to avoid exposing Trump’s crimes. This is a clear abuse of power, and all Americans need to speak up.
Sign here to join me in demanding answers from President Trump on why he abused the power of the presidency by commuting the sentence of Roger Stone! Defend the Rule of Law
No president has ever used this power so blatantly to reward a lackey for covering up their crimes. Trump’s decision will do ever further and lasting damage to public trust in our justice system.
That’s why, as Chair of the Judiciary Committee, I’m demanding an immediate briefing from the White House Counsel regarding President Trump’s decision to commute Roger Stone’s sentence.
Additionally, I’m calling on the Department of Justice to release all grand jury materials related to Roger Stone’s dealings with President Trump.
Add your name to join me in demanding an explanation from the White House on President Trump’s decision to commute Roger Stone’s sentence.
Thank you for all that you do,
Jerry

Our polls show this race a dead heat.
Nicole has been a reliable and consistent voice against the far left policies being pushed by Mayor de Blasio, Governor Cuomo and members of Congress like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
That’s why we need Nicole to win this race to keep fighting and hold the left accountable. Chip in $5, $10 or any amount today to help us win.
HELP US WIN
Nicole has a record of accomplishment:
* She successfully pushed back against Mayor de Blasio’s attempts to dismantle specialized high schools and gifted & talented programs.
* She wrote to the US Justice Department to stop left wing politicians’ attempts to open heroin injection centers.
* She got the Mayor to form a property tax commission whose recommendations will benefit middle class homeowners.
* She convinced Mayor de Blasio to alter NYC’s sanctuary policy and deport those who commit sex crimes.
* She is leading the fight to fix Cuomo’s dangerous bail law.
Nicole is giving up her seat in the state legislature to run for Congress this November. She must win or we will lose one of our best advocates for common sense.
If you agree that we need Nicole to continue fighting for us and hold the left accountable, chip in $5, $10 or any amount today.

FRIEND-
The last thing Bill de Blasio wants is Nicole Malliotakis in Congress.
Why? Nicole has been one of the few elected officials in New York City to hold Mayor de Blasio accountable. She:
✅ Stopped de Blasio’s attempt to bring heroin injection centers to NYC
✅ Got de Blasio to deport illegal immigrants who commit sex crimes
✅ Pushed de Blasio to establish a property tax commission currently underway
✅ Voted against tax increases 336 times
✅ Opposed closing Rikers Island and led the fight to fix the disastrous bail reform putting criminals back on the street
✅ Is fighting to reopen our city’s economy
The list goes on. We can count on Nicole to stand up to Bill de Blasio, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the socialist squad in Congress!
At Sunday’s “Save our City” rally, Nicole said it best: “Make no mistake... the anarchy, the lawlessness, the attacks on job creators, this is an attempt to bring socialism to our nation and we reject it.”

And that’s why far-left groups are pouring millions into Max Rose’s campaign to preserve Nancy Pelosi’s rubber stamp and ensure New York City radicals have no real opposition.
We CANNOT allow our elected officials to be bought by dark money... it's time to save our city.

On Wednesday, I joined with clergy, law enforcement and the public in a march to end gun violence and restore law and order to our streets. It was a beautiful coalition of all races, religions and backgrounds to support the NYPD.
Watch our discussion of the march with organizers Bishop Gerald Seabrooks of the Rehoboth Cathedral and President Ed Mullins of the NYPD Sergeants Benevolent Association:
WATCH THE VIDEO
This diverse group is united because we all want the same thing… A safe NYC to work, live, and raise our families.
Sadly, even this peaceful march was met with a counter protest and anarchists injured multiple police officers.
We must always remember our police officers put their lives on the line every day to protect the safety of our community. At a time when our city is experiencing an increase in shootings and crime, it's more important than ever to unite against lawlessness and violence.

Liberals, including Max Rose, have put us all in danger by voting for or supporting policies like:
❌ Closing Rikers Island
❌ Releasing of convicted felons
❌ Eliminating bail for rioting, arson, robbery and assault
It is absolutely unacceptable for politicians like Max Rose to protect criminals instead of protecting our communities.

The disturbing reality is, Max Rose:
* Joined those calling to defund the NYPD
* Voted to release convicted felons
* Supported the disastrous bail reform
* And supports the closure of Rikers Island
While Nancy Pelosi’s Money Machine continues to bankroll Max Rose’s campaign, the NYPD budget was slashed, crime has spiked in NYC and Max Rose continues to say one thing in the district and do another in Washington.

Friends-
The new state law giving driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants is causing massive problems for law enforcement, federal immigration officials and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Max Rose didn’t join with other members of New York’s Congressional Delegation to urge a U.S. Department of Justice review of the law’s constitutionality. This is shocking considering he sits on the Homeland Security committee.
The law has denied local law enforcement access to important information they need to solve crimes and it even requires the DMV to give illegal immigrants a heads up that federal agents are seeking them. It’s outrageous that elected officials are undermining our law enforcement by giving illegal immigrants with warrants a head start.
Watch my appearance on Fox & Friends and donate today:
No matter what Max Rose thinks, this law is wrong and I’ll fight to stop it as a Member of Congress as I have as a member of the State Assembly.
Donate today!

Friends-
Meet Kamala Harris - the anti-cop, pro-gang power-hungry danger who loves putting people in jail for political gain but goes easy on people who are a threat to the community. I’ll let the headlines and articles speak for themselves and you’ll see the true Kamala Harris.
SF Chronicle, April 14, 2004
D.A. won't pursue death in cop slaying
""San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris said Tuesday she will not seek the death penalty against a man accused of killing a San Francisco police officer over the weekend, a decision that legal experts say is rare if not unprecedented in California""
SF Gate, May 21, 2010
Judge rips Harris' office for hiding problems
""In a scathing ruling, the judge concluded that [Harris] had failed to fulfill their constitutional duty to tell defense attorneys about problems surrounding Deborah Madden, the now-retired technician at the heart of the cocaine-skimming scandal that led police to shut down the drug analysis section of their crime lab.""
If you think Kamala Harris withholding crucial evidence that could let innocent people out of jail all while going easy on gang members who kill cops isn’t bad enough (it is), let me show you in her own words what she thinks of the disastrous bail reform policies that have sent crime souring in New York City:
New York City is burning down thanks to Bill de Blasio and Max Rose’s awful bail boondoggle, but Kamala Harris wants to double down on the policy.
NO THANK YOU.

Democrats at the city, state & federal level have created LAWLESSNESS in New York:
* Their support for a dangerous bail law
* Their decriminalization of quality of life crimes
* Their rush to close Rikers Island
* Their acceptance of sanctuary cities
* Their tying of law enforcement hands
It must end. One party rule must end. Lets take back NY-11 and restore New York City’s only Republican voice in Washington.

181,"Friend, Over 18,000 of you signed a petition and even more joined me in being vocal against the disastrous bail reform which took effect on January 1st and reduced our safety and increased crime in our city and state.
Friend,
As we continue to fight COVID-19, I want to make sure you are also aware of significant changes we achieved to New York’s dangerous bail reform while we were in Albany earlier this month.
Over 18,000 of you signed a petition and even more joined me in being vocal against the disastrous bail reform which took effect on January 1st and reduced our safety and increased crime in our city and state.
At the beginning of March, Nicole was invited on FOX & Friends to discuss the bail reform and fixes to the law getting closer.
WATCH NOW
Fixing the botched bail reform has been one of my top priorities and we’ve made progress under the one-party rule in Albany. After countless press conferences, community outrage, and pressure we put on Governor Cuomo and the Democrats, here’s what we achieved:
A large number of offenses were added to the list of ""qualifying offenses"" that are eligible for bail:
* Class A-I felony drug offenses;
* Sex trafficking;
* Money laundering in support of terrorism in the 3rd and 4th degrees;
* Strangulation
* Promoting a sexual performance by a child;
* Any crime that is alleged to cause the death of another person;
* Vehicular assault in the 1st degree;
SEE FULL LIST
The changes also fixed issues that district attorneys had with discovery reform and better protects victims and witnesses personal information.
It's been a long-fought battle, but we persisted and were able to achieve significant changes to the botched bail reform adopted by the governor with one-party rule in last year’s budget. Not only did we add a significant number of offenses to those that qualify for bail, we added provisions to stop ""unlimited chances"" by ensuring that a person who either commits a crime after being released on their own recognizance, is on probation or is on post release supervision will have to face a judge in court who will be able to set bail.
Appearing on Tucker Carlson Tonight in November 2019, Nicole brought national attention to New York's radical bail law and launched her petition.
WATCH NOW
I'm happy to have worked with the District Attorneys’ Association, police unions, my colleagues and the public to demand common-sense changes to protect public safety.
While more still needs to be done, this is a big step in the right direction. Thank you for your help in making these improvements a reality.
Sincerely,
Nicole Malliotakis

182,"FRIEND-
I’m doing everything I can to get the botched bail law that Governor Cuomo and the democrat-controlled state legislature passed in the middle of the night with the State Budget FIXED.
In just two weeks we saw:
* An unlicensed illegal immigrant released with no bail after admitting to a hit and run that killed a young mother of three;
* A woman with a criminal history arrested for assaulting two Jewish women released and rearrested two more times in a week;
* A man with 24 prior arrests released without bail after being charged with assault for punching a police officer;
* A man accused of stabbing a woman to death in Albany back in July released under the new law;
* A man charged with predatory sex assault, rape of child less than 13 released without bail;
* A man arrested in connection to four Manhattan bank robberies released without bail and is suspected of robbing a 5th bank the next day in Brooklyn;
* A homeless man arrested for 2 unprovoked attacks on women was arrested again — just a few hours after his release;
And most shocking...
* On Sunday, a repeated drunk driver with 12 prior convictions, drove drunk again and killed a young medical student. He was released with no bail again after just being released on January 1 following an arrest for not having a court-ordered ignition interlock device in his car.
We must stop this madness.
Governor Cuomo and the state legislators, and those like Mayor de Blasio, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Max Rose who supported this while we tried to stop it, must ALL be held accountable.
Even worse, Democrat Presidential candidates like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Michael Bloomberg similar bail reform for federal crimes.
If we end up with a president and member of congress like Max Rose, what is happening with New York’s disastrous bail reform can happen nationally.
We must be vigilant about who we elect. Check out what I had to say on Tucker Carlson and Fox & Friends about this disastrous reform:
Sign my petition, forward it to your friends, and let's put a stop to this madness.

Together, we will win and stop this madness.

Devin Nunes is DELUSIONAL.
Sometimes we sincerely wonder if Devin Nunes believes the words coming out of his own mouth -- is he so far out of touch with reality that he’d paint himself as a crime fighter avenging an unfairly targeted president?
Devin Nunes: 'For almost 4 years, I have been attacked, smeared and slandered by the liberal media for my work exposing deep state corruption.
Nunes must be on another PLANET. Every conspiracy theory that leaves his mouth is more unhinged than the last.
Look, we know we’re at a disadvantage here. Nunes is sitting on millions and millions of dollars, and this is historically a very conservative district. But we still like our odds -- because generous donors have agreed to TRIPLE MATCH all donations made before our deadline!

Now, as this scandal unfolds, more than 2,450 former DOJ employees have signed a letter1 calling on Trump's Attorney General, William Barr, to RESIGN.
SIGN ON and join them: Our country’s top law enforcement officer must enforce the law, not do the president’s personal bidding. Attorney General Barr must resign immediately →
No one is above the law! Attorney General William Barr must resign.
The letter’s signers include lawyers who worked under both Republican and Democratic presidents:
As former DOJ officials, we each proudly took an oath to support and defend our Constitution and faithfully execute the duties of our offices. The very first of these duties is to apply the law equally to all Americans…
A person should not be given special treatment in a criminal prosecution because they are a close political ally of the President. Governments that use the enormous power of law enforcement to punish their enemies and reward their allies are not constitutional republics; they are autocracies.
Roger Stone was convicted of making false statements to Congress and witness tampering. Those are serious crimes.
We can’t have an Attorney General who would let someone off easy just because the president wants him to!

Trump escaped impeachment simply because the GOP saved his hide.

So Kamala Harris, speaking as a former prosecutor, is simply trying to uphold the law. Trump is not above the law and he must be held accountable.

BREAKING: Kamala Harris says her administration would bring CRIMINAL CHARGES against Trump.
NPR: Kamala Harris says her administration would have no choice but to charge Trump with crimes.
SHOULD TRUMP BE PROSECUTED FOR HIS CRIMES WHEN HE LEAVES OFFICE?
Trump
YES >>
NO >>
UNSURE >>
PLEASE BE HONEST. OFFICIAL POLL CONDUCTED 09/06/2020, COLLECTING RESPONSES UNTIL 11:59PM.
Trump escaped impeachment simply because the GOP saved his hide.
But in the impeachment trial, we saw hard evidence that Trump obstructed justice.
So Kamala Harris, speaking as a former prosecutor, is simply trying to uphold the law. Trump is not above the law and he must be held accountable.
But charging an ex-President (even one as CORRUPT and CRIMINAL as Trump) is controversial, so we need to gauge support among informed California Democrats.
The Department of Justice will NEVER act unless we show public support, so we need your response immediately >>

Donald Trump is lying, cheating, and abusing his power to PREVENT Americans from voting safely in November.
He’s SMEARING Joe Biden, baselessy accusing him of crimes, and spending MILLIONS on attack ads to peddle those lies in critical swing states.
But despite a national lead, Biden is still BEHIND in six critical swing states.
A national lead means nothing if we lose the Electoral College again!
If we FAIL to hit our $100,000 mid-month goal, we’ll have NO CHANCE to fight back against Trump’s fearsome fundraising machine. We could see a 2016 repeat.

FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES: Trump has fired FIVE Inspector Generals -- “a full-fledged attack on [their] ability to investigate his administration.”
THIS IS A COVER UP: And now Adam Schiff is opening an INVESTIGATION into why Trump is firing government watchdogs.
Remember: Nixon resigned because he was caught COVERING UP his crimes. So we KNOW Trump’s impeachment cover-up could be key to taking him down.
But we DON’T know what voters think about his NEW cover-up. You are one of 30 California voters selected for our Post-Impeachment Strategy Survey.

COMPLETE BY 11:59 PM.
This is a pivotal moment. Trump believes he can fire and intimidate everyone who holds him accountable -- including the Inspector General who protected the impeachment whistleblower and revealed his contact with Ukrainians.
Trump already got away with firing Lt. Col. Vindman. He already got away with impeachment. Now he’s fired FIVE Inspector Generals in RETALIATION.
If we do nothing now, Trump will go unchecked, and nobody will speak out again.
We need you to take our brand new survey -- it's the most important thing you can do to build an effective strategy to defeat Trump.

Help me bring back accountability in November.
Friends,
As you may have already heard, Attorney General Ken Paxton was accused by his top aides for multiple crimes that include bribery and abuse of office. And on top of that, he’s refusing to resign. But this isn’t the first time Paxton was let off the hook from using his office for personal gain:
First: Paxton abused people’s faith in his public office after being indicted in 2015 for Securities Fraud.
Then: Paxton tried to eliminate healthcare coverage for millions of Texans and threatened to prosecute those who wanted to vote by mail.
Now: Paxton is refusing to resign and our leaders are letting him get away with it again.
Texans deserve better than this. And our chance to bring accountability back to our state is only 24 days away. Pitch in $25 today to help us bring about real change to Texas on November 3rd >>>

As we celebrate the last unofficial days of summer, let's not forget to recognize the union organizers who have made it possible for us to enjoy weekends like these with our loved ones. We owe many of the workplace protections we enjoy today to their unwavering commitment to fighting for better jobs, better working conditions, and stronger families.
When our workers are taken care of -- our community is stronger. Whether it's our selfless educators, our resilient ship builders, or our dedicated service employees, the women and men of labor movements have helped build our Commonwealth and our country.
But right now, too many Americans are facing real hardship. The fight for the security and dignity of our workers is far from over -- we must continue the fight for living wages and access to quality and affordable health care.
As a member of Congress, I'm proud to represent hard working Virginians and I will never stop fighting to ensure our working families, seniors, and veterans get the benefits they have earned.
Thanks again, and from my family to yours, I hope you have a safe and happy Labor Day.
Here's to continuing the good work,
Elaine

Wow, what a month!
June was Pride Month — and Ralph Norman fought to allow employers to discriminate against LGBTQ+ Americans just for being who they are.
We’ve been reckoning with the epidemic of racism against Black Americans — and Ralph Norman initially voted against making lynching a federal hate crime.
We’ve been dealing with a spike in COVID-19 infections here in South Carolina — and Ralph Norman voted against COVID-19 relief for South Carolina families.
REPLACE RALPH »
I’ll be honest, team — I can’t find a reason not to show Ralph Norman the door.
But it’s not going to be easy, because all that energy Ralph hasn’t spent fighting for South Carolinians like you and me, he’s spent building his business in Congress and running hundreds of thousands of dollars of Facebook ads to hold on to his seat.
Can you rush a grassroots donation before tonight’s deadline to make sure we have what it takes to replace Ralph this year? We can’t do it without you!

# Nicole Galloway for Missouri
Hey team,
Governor Parson finally realized that we need action on the heartbreaking violence plaguing our communities. He’s called for a special legislative session, but he’s failed to recognize the role that gun safety has on this issue.
Missouri has one of the highest rates of gun deaths per year and some of the weakest gun laws in the country. We cannot afford to have these facts continue to be ignored by politicians in our state.
We need REAL action to deal with the devastating gun violence in our state. That’s why today, we’re asking you to please sign our petition demanding common-sense gun safety measures from our leaders in Jefferson City.
SIGN THE PETITION
Last year, when Missourians pleaded with the Governor for a response to children being murdered by gunfire, he said he had to “stay in his lane” — he later called a special session about tax breaks for used cars and yachts instead. And just as he’s finally called for a special session, he’s also continuing to celebrate and parade his A+ rating from the NRA.
Nicole Galloway knows we need real action to confront this epidemic of gun violence. We need common-sense gun safety laws like universal background checks and permits, and we need to let local communities adopt gun safety and anti-crime measures when leaders in Jefferson City fail to act.
It’s well past time that Governor Parson and Missouri politicians got serious about gun violence in Missouri. If you agree, add your name to our call for our leaders to take real action against gun violence right now >>
SIGN THE PETITION
Thanks for making a difference,

# Nicole Galloway for Missouri
Earlier today, Parson's PAC launched a new wave of attacks filled with shocking and obvious lies, like accusing me and supporters like you of being ""pro-crime.""
I won't dignify these offensive and false attacks with a response. But I will tell you what it says about this race: The status quo is running scared.
In a moment, I'll ask you for your help to fight back — but first, let me explain.
On Governor Parson's watch, everyday families have struggled with rising healthcare costs, underfunded schools and fewer opportunities — all while insiders and mega-donors have been raking in favors and kickbacks. When I'm governor, that all comes to an end — and the folks in power know it.
When we launched this campaign, early polls had us down against Parson by double digits. Now more than a year, multiple fundraising records, and millions of calls and texts later, our grassroots movement has made Missouri a battleground state. The billionaires and special interests are spinning up outrageous lies every week because they're panicking — as they should be.
As Auditor, I've been the taxpayers’ independent watchdog. I've uncovered more than $370 million in wasted or stolen taxpayer money and brought more than 60 criminal counts against corrupt public officials from both political parties. When I say I'll end their culture of corruption, they know it's no BS — that's why I'm running to defeat Mike Parson, and it's why I'm asking for your support today:
Will you add a donation of $5 or whatever you can to my campaign so we can set the record straight for undecided voters before Election Day? We can’t settle for a bought-and-paid-for system any longer — not during this pandemic and not for what comes next — so your donation right now is critical.
Thanks for making a difference when it matters most,
Nicole

Dear Brown,
Yesterday, the Austin Asian Communities Civic Coalition held a candidate forum for all of the Travis County Congressional districts. You can view the forum here. The questions for TX-17 candidates begin at the 53 minute mark.
Pete Sessions avoided answering the moderator's direct questions, and instead talked about the strength of the stock market and the need for law and order.
The first question was about the most important issue on his website - stopping welfare abuse by illegal immigrants. Sessions claimed that it's not his most important issue and pivoted to the party line touting the strength of the stock market. The issue is in fact the only issue he addresses on his website.
When challenged in a follow up question that the stock market doesn't reflect the general economy, he falsely claims that Steve Mnuchin is a Democrat, and implies that since ""only 1 in 64 Americans"" has tested positive for COVID-19, we need to get our kids back to school so we can all go back to work.
The death toll has passed 175,000.
Finally, I encourage you to go to the 1:30 mark. When asked in a follow up whether President Trump respects the rule of law, he says, ""you know what I'm in reference to - I'm in reference to Portland, Minneapolis, Chicago..."" In Session’s interpretation, rule of law applies to heavy-handed suppression of protests but not to potential crimes committed by those in Trump’s administration or by the president himself.
Sessions' strategy was to de-emphasize the economic and health impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, while I spoke about needing an effective government response that will allow us to recover. We need new leadership, not more of the same.
Demand Better. Pitch in now and help me beat Pete.

Alex --
Good evening and welcome to our Week-End Update.
This week, much of the news in Washington revolved around the impeachment hearings in the U.S. Senate. Over the past months and weeks, I have detailed my feelings regarding the impeachment sham.
I believe that the Wall Street Journal’s Kimberly Strassel encapsulates many of the points I have been stressing and makes a compelling case, in her piece Crying Wolf on Impeachment against the Democratic leadership. She writes:
“The impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump is coming down to one big question: Will Democrats, by crying wolf, drown out the more legitimate Republican cry of foul? ‘Foul’ has served as the GOP’s most powerful and honest argument from the first days of these impeachment maneuverings.”
“Democrats broke every standard of due process, transparency and fairness in their House investigation, making a mockery of their constitutional duty.”
* “They hid the identity of the original accuser, denying Republicans and the country the ability to judge his motives.”
* “They held secret depositions, barring more than three-quarters of House members, as well as the press and the American public.”
* “They called 18 witnesses, but blocked the president from calling any in his defense.”
* “The White House legal team was excluded from the proceedings—prohibited from cross-examining witnesses, denied the ability to introduce any evidence that spoke to the central question of the president’s focus on Ukrainian corruption.”
* “Democrats approved two articles of impeachment that failed to identify a crime.”
The U.S. Senate rejected the call for more witnesses in the impeachment trial. House Democratic Leadership has failed to make a case for impeachment and there is no reason to call additional witnesses. It was interesting to see that the Democrats were hellbent on calling additional witnesses as long as they are not Joe or Hunter Biden. Maybe because they are like an onion, the more you peel the Bidens back, the more you cry. Thankfully for our nation, it appears this saga will be concluding in the coming days... or as the New York Post headline reads below, it's ""All Over But The Pouting.""
The President made strides in our efforts towards peace between Israel and Palestine. Peace requires compromise, but Israel cannot compromise the security of their country or its people. President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu created an agreement that balances peaceful coexistence with the need for security.
Additionally, President Trump signed the USMCA trade agreement.
This historic trade deal is another example of President Trump’s policies putting our workers, farmers, and manufacturers first.
* USMCA adds $68 billion to our economy and will create 176,000 jobs nationwide. The President signing USMCA delivers a key promise to level the playing field for our country in trade.
* Mexico and Canada are key markets for goods and agricultural products from Pennsylvania. This deal supports farmers and businesses in our district by improving their market access and is an especially great improvement for our dairy producers.
* USMCA ushers in a more balanced and fairer trading relationship for North America and is a big win for America and Pennsylvania.
I spoke on the floor of the United States House this week about the different definitions of productivity at the two ends of Pennsylvania Avenue at this point in time. At the Capitol, Democrat Leadership continues to confuse activity with accomplishment. They have spent YEARS trying to impeach and remove a duly elected president. However, at the White House, President Trump has delivered two significant victories this week... a middle east peace plan and the signing of the USMCA. Just imagine of all the energy from this impeachment was used to solve the problems of the American people. It is critical Republicans #TakeBackTheHouse
IN NEWS YOU WON’T HEAR IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA: This week, I voted against the House Democrat Leadership's attempt to further weaken our countries ability to respond to terrorists in a combat zone by stripping the President as Commander and Chief's authority to engage our military to target and eliminate terrorists or enemies of the state. This authority was effectively put to use to takeout terrorist Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Soleimani was designated a terrorist by multiple countries. This legislation is being brought to the House floor for a vote only to damage the President politically and with a blind eye to our countries safety.
The 2002 Authorization for Use MF authorizes military action to “defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq,” including against ISIS and threats directed by Iran.
Repealing the Authorization for Use of Military Force without a replacement would undermine the Iraqi government, send the wrong signal to our regional partners and allies, and embolden Iran-backed militia groups who fuel sectarian violence.
On Tuesday, we paused to observe Holocaust Remembrance Day and recognize the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We remember the survivors, those who were lost and pledge to fight anti-Semitism. #NeverAgain
We also recognized School Choice Week. Families should have the ability to choose a school that best fits their needs, child’s skills and interests. This is an opportunity to advocate for choice and celebrate public, private, parochial and all schools educating our youth for the jobs of today and tomorrow.
Today is also the beginning of Black History Month and we celebrate the lasting legacies of African Americans whose lives have shaped our nation’s history and culture. Today, black Americans have someone in the White House in President Trump who is delivering record low unemployment.
One of the most significant accomplishments of the Trump Administration has been the President’s success in making our nation energy independent. No longer are we held hostage to the Middle East as we work to ensure our nation can produce its own power to keep us all moving. As part of that effort, President Trump is working to save over 1,000 family-sustaining jobs in Pennsylvania by helping to keep the refinery in Philadelphia open. Click here to read more.
I joined other members of Congress as we received a briefing from Dr. Redfield from the Center for Disease Control, Dr. Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Kadlec from the Department of Health and Human Services, and Jonathan Fritz and Yolanda Parra from the State Department regarding the coronavirus. Their briefing provided the following information:
* At this time, the virus poses a low risk to the United States and there are only 5 confirmed cases here.
* There are 6,000 confirmed cases in China concentrated mostly in Wuhan Province. Chinese officials have severely restricted travel from Wuhan Province to contain the virus there.
* Treatments are being developed but may take a year to be fully developed. As health officials contain this virus, the U.S. CDC recommends against all nonessential travel to China.
* The CDC feels the best way to contain coronavirus is through classic public health measures such as maintaining a high level of hygiene, regularly washing your hands, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and face.
Chinese and American officials are in regular contact and we will receive updates as will the general public. I will provide future updates as I receive them. For additional information about coronavirus and how to prevent its spread, visit the CDC website.
In the District, I want to send out my congratulations and support to Lebanon County’s former District Attorney and our new State Senator Dave Arnold. Dave was sworn-in on Wednesday and will be a tremendous addition Harrisburg. Dave is a conservative and understands that smaller government and lower taxes leads to prosperity. As many of you know. Dave was diagnosed with brain cancer shortly after receiving the GOP nomination for State Senate. Dave is beating cancer and his doctors have given him an excellent prognosis. This situation highlights the strength of Dave’s family as his wife and daughter stood by his side as he battled cancer and won his election to the state senate. I look forward to working alongside Dave as we focus on making Lebanon County an even better place to live, work and raise our families.
Additionally, I want to acknowledge our new Lebanon County District Attorney Pier Hess Graf. She will be a strong voice against crime and be tenacious in her work to keep our streets safe.
As a reminder, as this is an election year, we have begun circulating petitions to run for reelection to Congress. Petition circulation begins this Tuesday, January 28th. If you would like to join our team, please let us know. For copies of petitions, questions or information regarding petition events across the District, please contact our Field Campaign Manager Rob Bresnahan at [[URL REDACTED]]
Today, we attended the Berks County GOP meeting, where I officially announced my intentions to seek another term in office. Representing the people of the 9th District is a tremendous honor and responsibility. My goal every day is to do what’s in the best interests of the families, neighborhoods and communities in our District. Berks County has always been so welcoming to our campaign and we felt it was appropriate to make our formal reelection announcement surrounding by our friends and supporters in the County. Pictured below with GOP Auditor General candidate Tim DeFoor and a younger supporter Suzannah Gillen who I gave my lapel pin.
Later, we attended the Columbia County GOP Winter Picnic. We were joined by State Senator John Gordner and State Representatives David Millard and Kurt Masser. This was a great event and there is a lot of enthusiasm for President Trump and the Republican ticket. Pictured below with Ashok & Naymesh Patel and children.
Last week, we inserted a political cartoon we thought was timely regarding the impeachment effort. This week, I have another cartoon I found that I think is appropriate considering tomorrow is Groundhog Day. Enjoy.
On Monday, I will appear on WPPA “Step up to the Mic” from 10-11 am. If you get a chance, please be sure to tune in.
Thank you and we will see you soon,

Good afternoon and welcome to our Week-End Update.
Impeachment:
Since the day he was sworn in, the priority of House Democrats has been to scrutinize, delegitimize, charge with crimes, and remove from office President Donald J. Trump.
The process, players, and underlying proof at the heart of this impeachment have been fundamentally flawed and brazenly biased. Click here to view my interview on WBRE regarding impeachment.
We have witnessed a blatantly unfair process: carefully choosing rehearsed witnesses, hiding exculpatory evidence, limiting dissenting views, and denying the President due process.
Chairmen Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff have led this impeachment process by presuming the President’s guilt and racing towards a predetermined outcome. Chairman Nadler, along with two-thirds of the Democrat Judiciary Committee membership, voted to advance impeachment before any call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky even took place. Equally disturbing, Intelligence Committee Chairman Schiff has a record of being untruthful to the American people regarding the details of his investigation, basic facts, and his staff’s interaction with ‘the whistleblower.’
Despite all of this, Democrats still failed to provide any proof of Presidential wrongdoing. After months of polling and focus group testing aimed at creating the most politically advantageous allegations against our President, Democrat leadership arrived at two charges, ‘abuse of power’ and ‘obstruction of Congress.’ These vague terms attempt to mask the fact that months of congressional investigations have produced one simple and undeniable fact: President Trump did not commit an impeachable offense.
Not only are these articles vague, but each is also easily dispelled. President Zelensky’s confirmation of ‘no pressure’ and ‘no quid pro quo’ immediately negates the validity of any charge of Presidential ‘abuse of power.’ The President has inherent Constitutional executive authorities and privileges. If House Democrats classify the utilization of those authorities as an ‘obstruction of Congress,’ every President since Jimmy Carter – and every President moving forward – would and will be impeached.
This entire year has been a period of opportunity lost. Rather than working to improve the lives of the American public, this Democrat-led Congress has focused its full time and attention on passing partisan legislation and driving political outcomes. I look forward to the new year of 2020 and enacting legislation to benefit seniors, veterans, farmers, and families. As the Senate will hold a fair trial to evaluate this case – without presumption – I am 100 percent confident the President will not be removed from office. In spite of the Democrats’ desperate tactics to win the White House by removing the President, the people will ultimately decide who will be elected in 2020.
Spending Bill:
This week, I appeared on Fox Business to discuss bills passed to fund the Federal government for the next fiscal year. There were two bills offered. I voted for the spending bill that funds our national defense and border security. The second spending bill had excessive spending I could not support. Nevertheless it's the best President Trump will get from this Pelosi-led House, so he will sign it. This is another big reason Republicans must win back control of the U.S. [[URL REDACTED]] here or below to watch my interview.
IN NEWS YOU WON""T HEAR ON MAINSTREAM MEDIA: Last night our nation heard each Democrat candidate for the White House embrace two things. Hatred for President Trump and SOCIALISM.
Their socialist views of America were on full display. They are:
* Pushing full government-run healthcare and want to make private health insurance ILLEGAL.
* Embracing open borders that would flood our nation with illegal immigrants.
* Supporting hypocritical anti-energy policies, like the gan-Green New Deal, that would kill 10 million American jobs.
Worse yet, each Democrat has allowed their blind hatred for President Trump to express the truth about the many successes President Trump has accomplished, especially as it has related to the economy. Here are the FACTS:
* Since President Trump was elected, the U.S. has added 7.2 million jobs.
* The U.S. added 266,000 jobs in November.
* The unemployment rate is at 3.5%, remaining near a 50 year low in November.
* Wage growth was 3.1% year over year in November, the 16th month in a row wages have grown more than 3%, a benchmark reached for just 3 months total under President Obama.
* Consumer Sentiment remained historically high in November.
* The unemployment rate for African-Americans is 5.5%, near a record low.
* More than 524,000 manufacturing jobs have been added since President Trump was elected, while 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost under President Obama.
* Hispanic American unemployment remained near historic lows at 4.2% in November.
* Asian American unemployment is at 2.6%.
* Real median household income is at a record high of $65,084.
* The number of Americans in poverty is at the lowest point since 2007.
USMCA:
On Thursday, the House supported the President's efforts to make our economy even stronger by passing the USMCA, a historic trade deal for our country, and a big win for workers, farmers, and manufacturers in Pennsylvania and across the nation.
The agreement will continue to drive growth by adding $68 billion to the U.S. economy and creating 176,000 jobs across the country. Trade with Canada and Mexico supports more than 470,000 jobs in Pennsylvania alone, and more than 42,000 jobs in Pennsylvania depend on manufacturing exports to these countries. Canada and Mexico are also some of the most important markets for Pennsylvania’s agricultural exports. This deal will create a more balanced trade relationship with our North American partners and improve market access for our producers and processors – especially for our dairy and poultry farmers.
The President’s negotiation of this critical deal will establish free, fair, and reciprocal trade for our nation and allow for the high-quality foods and products that come from Pennsylvania’s Ninth District to be enjoyed worldwide.
Wishing you happy holidays and blessed Christmas,

Good evening. Welcome to our Week-End Update.
I want to begin our update by again thanking the brave men and women, the doctors, nurses, health care providers, police, firefighters, small businesses and countless others putting their lives in jeopardy to support their fellow Pennsylvanians during the COVID-19 pandemic. I also want to again express my condolences to the families who have lost family or friends to the virus. The tide is turning, but I realize that is of little comfort to those families who have been directly affected by the loss of a closed loved one due to COVID-19.
This week, our staff and I continued to work with constituents and businesses to navigate the Covid-19 climate and transition as stay-at-home orders are lifted and many begin to return to work. This week, Governor Tom Wolf began the process of reopening Pennsylvania. The Governor announced that on May 8, 2020, twenty-four counties will partially reopen, mostly in northwestern and north-central parts of Pennsylvania. The 24 counties that will are Bradford, Cameron, Centre, Clarion, Clearfield, Clinton, Crawford, Elk, Erie, Forest, Jefferson, Lawrence, Lycoming, McKean, Mercer, Montour, Northumberland, Potter, Snyder, Sullivan, Tioga, Union, Venango, and Warren. Click here to read the Governor’s press release.
I will continue to advocate for Pennsylvania to follow the CDC guidelines and be innovative regarding our Commonwealth's own situation as they begin to reopen. We need to be inclusive with the private sector to establish safe working standards so our economy can begin recovering in a safe manner. There is no question that we have had a very deliberate shutdown of our economy. However, we cannot cause businesses to go bankrupt and for families to go without essential needs. This is why Congress passed the CARES Act, which has proven to be a good comprehensive plan to address the economic issues caused by the virus. Governors throughout the nation must be strategic as they safely open up the economy and create revenue. We cannot afford to see states create budget deficits so large that cause many of our citizens' longterm pain.
In other business, as a member of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, I participated in a virtual forum to discuss “Coronavirus Pandemic Response: The Impact of Economic and Health Care Services on Homeless Veterans in America.”
I also received an update by the Congressional Budget Office receiving projections of output, employment and interest rates and a preliminary look at Federal deficits for 2020 and 2021. There is no way to minimize the impact that COVID-19 has had on our economy. Unemployment has risen and our GDP has declined. However, there are signs that indicate that our economy can and will rebound. Let us not forget that before COVID-19, the American economy, due in large part to the leadership of President Donald Trump, was humming. Unemployment was at historic lows and businesses were thriving. We will recover and President Trump and Congressional Republicans will empower the PRIVATE sector to ensure a strong recovery.
We held several tele-town halls with our constituents from the 9th District to discuss the COVID-19 outbreak, and in particular, unemployment compensation benefits. I was joined on one of the tele-town calls by Pennsylvania Secretary of Labor and Industry W. Gerald Oleksiak and Unemployment Compensation Director Susan Dickinson. I spoke about the CARES Act, which included economic relief payments and supplemental unemployment payments meant to help individuals who lost their jobs through no fault of their own. For a full recap of the call, please read this article from The Reading Eagle.
I conducted a tele-town hall with Americans for Prosperity and Concerned Veterans of America. We had a Q&A with our veteran community and discussed the many ways that the Federal government and our office are working to assist veterans throughout the 9th District during the COVID-19 outbreak. We are greatly aided in that effort by having one of the premier hospitals, the Lebanon VA, in our District. If any veteran in our District is having trouble with their benefits, please contact our office.
We also participated in a tele-town hall with the International Franchise Association and many of its members throughout Pennsylvania with Congressman Kevin Hern.
Additionally, I held teleconference calls with the community banks and credit unions throughout the 9th Congressional. Republican Ranking Member of the Financial Services Committee Patrick McHenry joined me on this call to answer questions. I do want to again commend our community banks for their great effort and work related to the PPP loan process. Nothing of this magnitude is perfect, but the quantity of loans going out in such a short period of time is very commendable. Many banks are working multiple shifts and weekends. The second phase of the PPP, which began on Monday, seems to be going very well. Thus far, the average loan amount is less than $100k. It is not often that the intent of a government program is in line with the results.
The Treasurer's office issued some new FAQ's related to the PPP program that has raised additional questions. Please know that we are anticipating added guidance to many of your questions on this. Once available, we will be sure to get this information out to you.
There were also big developments related to the agricultural industry, where nearly $20 billion is being allocated via the USDA directly to the agricultural community with a good portion to Pennsylvania farmers and our dairy industry which has suffered much during this crisis. We as Pennsylvanians need to all understand the importance of our farms and whenever possible have a glass of milk. It does a body good.
As part of our continued effort to keep constituents informed regarding the COVID-19 outbreak and related issues, I conducted interviews with R.J. Harris on WHP580 (Listen by clicking here); with Jason Barsky on WILK-FM; WFMZ’s Business Matters (Watch by clicking here or on the picture below);

IN NEWS YOU WON’T READ IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA: The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) officially relaunched this week. After distributing $350 billion in loans to 1.6 million small businesses earlier this month, the program ran out of funds in just 14 days. Thankfully, Congress agreed to replenish the popular program.
The President signed that $310 billion funding. This week, President Trump welcomed small business owners to the White House to share their stories from the first successful round of loans in early April. Here are a sampling of their comments:
* Amy Wright of Bitty + Beau’s Coffee has said that her business-saving loan “is a game-changer for us.”
* Ed and Jim’s Body Shop in Pennsylvania has been in business for over 50 years. As Coronavirus forced Americans to stay home, owner Brandon Hutson had to lay off most of his workers. Now, the shop can reemploy its furloughed staff and provide each of them with a paycheck—a “live-saver for us,” Hutson says.
* Tony Stafford had to furlough over 100 employees when he was forced to close the dining rooms of his 3 restaurants in Virginia. “I promised every one of [my workers] we would get through this,” he said. “When we applied and received the PPP loan, I knew that I would be able to keep that promise.”
* JD Clark is a construction and maintenance firm specializing in low-income and affordable housing. All of its contracts were put on hold because of Coronavirus. Owner Tisa Clark describes talking to one of her employees, a single mother, after securing a PPP loan. “I could just see the relief coming to her!” Ms. Clark said.
With last week’s signing, President Trump has now allocated more than $660 billion for the loan program in total. During PPP’s first run, the Small Business Administration and the Treasury Department processed 14 years’ worth of loans in less than 14 days.
These loans have helped save 30 million American jobs so far.
In non-COVID-19 related news, the revelation that evidence has surfaced that top officials in the FBI worked to set-up former White House national security advisor Michael Flynn is disturbing. This group of FBI leader are supposed to exist to investigate crimes, not to create them. In this scenario, these individuals were successful in destroying Mr. Flynn’s name, reputation and cost him his job. These horrible public servants, paid with taxpayer funds, need to be investigated and held responsible. As it appears right now, General Flynn's name and reputation should be cleared. Let's hope the media presents this story even half as much as they spent tearing down General Flynn and the President.
I want to remind you again that, particularly during these trying times, I, as well as my entire Washington and District teams, are here for you. We are available for any issues you are facing that may require our assistance, we can help make contacts for you and know that the full weight of our office will be applied to help Pennsylvanians get through this crisis.
Please continue to help out where you can. For those of you on the frontline, Shelley and I are joining a host of Lebanon County elected officials in sponsoring another Take Out On Us event in Lebanon County on March 7 from 11 am - 1 pm. We are providing lunch as a thank you to those on the frontlines. See the details below.
My son and I were in the woods at 5 am this morning kicking off the opening day of spring turkey season. Unfortunately, we are getting take-out for dinner. (See picture below)
I hope you have a great weekend, stay safe and we will see you soon.

Good morning and welcome to our Week-End Update.
This was a busy week in Washington as we again voted on legislation to support employees and small business owners recover as we continue the work of reopening our economy in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.
First, we passed a bill, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act, which gives small businesses more time to use PPP loans and addresses concerns around loan forgiveness. The bill extends the length of time businesses have to use the loans from 8 weeks to 24 weeks and pushes back the deadline to rehire workers. This new legislation, which still needs to pass in the U.S. Senate, is prospective for new loans. If passed and signed into law, those with current PPP loans can reapply under the new loan provisions. With many businesses still shutdown and the prospect of reopening potentially weeks away, these changes were necessary to continue to support these hardworking Pennsylvanians.
In related news, this week, I introduced the Coronavirus Swindlers, Crooks, and Manipulators (SCAM) Act, a bipartisan effort to crack down on the rising number of scams during the coronavirus pandemic. Some of the most common offenses have included phishing emails targeted at seniors and their recovery checks, websites selling fake masks, and deliberate misinformation regarding CDC guidance. The SCAM Act would heighten the penalties for those committing these crimes during the coronavirus pandemic.
Since the coronavirus pandemic began, there has been an unfortunate rise in the number of scams aimed at taking advantage of hardworking Americans and seniors. For example, the FTC has reported more than 50,000 scams totaling $38.6 million dollars and the IRS has investigated 15,000 false websites since economic impact payments began. These fraudulent schemes are always shameful, but scammers using this time of crisis to take advantage of vulnerable individuals is absolutely reprehensible. The SCAM Act warns that these scammers engaging in deceitful activities will pay a steep price.
In our efforts to keep people throughout the 9th District informed on the latest activities in Washington and important topics, I conducted a series of interviews with RJ Harris on WHP 580, the David Webb Show on SiriusXM Patriot, WPPA Pottsville and conducted an interview for the Trump Campaign with Tim Murtaugh which can be viewed by clicking here or on the picture below.
Over the past week, I participated in the Carbon County Strong Day with State Representative Doyle Heffley and Executive Director of the Carbon Chamber of Economic Development Corporation, Marlyn Kissner, to celebrate Carbon County Strong Day. Small businesses are the backbone of our communities. Carbon County Strong Day was a celebration of their resiliency over the past several months and a reminder for all of us to support them.
In the District, I participated in the Tamaqua Memorial Day ceremony with American Legion Post 73, which included a 21-gun salute, taps and wreath-laying.
Later, I attended a Port Carbon Memorial Day tribute at the Vietnam War home association, where I am a member. This Memorial Day tribute is usually packed with people. Even though different this year, Patriotism throughout the Pa-9 was never stronger. Pictured with member veterans and founding member Joe Kuperavage.
That evening, Shelley and I took a ride out to Harvey's Lake, stopped by Rick and Charlottes, met up with Bikers for Trump Tom Lantz and his All-American Harley. We talked about Freedom and the great Americans who sacrificed it all for us. It was a great Memorial Day.
In News You Won’t Read In The Mainstream Media: Congress was back in session for the first time with the new proxy voting rules in place.
* 70 \- The number of Democratic Congressional members who had another member vote for them.
* 0 \- The number of Republican Congressional members who had another member vote for them.
* 0 \- The number of times I will ever vote by proxy. I take my role to serve the 9th Congressional District seriously and you can ALWAYS count on me to show up and make sure you are being represented in person at the U.S. Capitol.
On Tuesday, House Republicans filed a lawsuit to block the practice of remote voting. As I have explained before, Article 1, Section 5 of the U.S. Constitution states that a quorum is necessary for House business to be conducted. I believe the House resolution is unconstitutional, and we are contesting that in court.
Election Update: Reminder, this Tuesday, June 2nd, is Primary Election Day and polls are open from 7 am-8 pm. Please vote. Our nation is facing unprecedented times and we have a critical election approaching in November. I humbly ask for your support of President Trump and myself. We must reelect President Trump and win back control of the U.S. House of Representatives. While I am unopposed in the Primary Election, I truly appreciate your support.
If you need yard signs for polling places or have questions related to the election, please feel free to contact our Field Campaign Manager Rob Bresnahan at [[URL REDACTED]]
Additionally, to find your polling place, please click here. NOTE: Many polling locations have changed or been consolidated as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.
I hope you are having a great weekend, stay safe and we will see you soon.

Good evening and welcome to our Weekend Update.
I want to again begin by extending our best wishes to President Donald J. Trump and the First Lady on their recovery. It appears the President is in great shape and ready to hit the campaign trail again. This man cares deeply about our nation and I knew that Covid-19 would not keep him down very long. We look forward to seeing him again in Pennsylvania soon as we must ensure our Commonwealth goes for Trump again on November 3, 2020.
This week, we launched our first campaign web video, entitled People, Leadership, Our Future. During my time in office, I have worked to support President Trump’s America First Agenda, to advance federal legislation that is always in the interests of Pennsylvania and to communicate and be accessible to you in a highly effective manner. One of the ways we have done so is by recapping our activities and the latest news in these Weekly Update emails.
The upcoming election is about people, leadership and our future. It is critical that we win back control of the U.S. House and re-elect President Donald Trump. Click here or below to watch our video.
As part of our efforts to keep the public informed about our plans as we seek re-election, we participated in several candidate interviews. I answered questions for the Reading Eagle, which can be read by clicking here. We attended an editorial board meeting with the Daily Item and my interview can be viewed by clicking here or on the picture below.
This week, I joined my colleague Congressman Fred Keller and the Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration, Jovita Carranza, in Luzerne County to address local businesses that have received EIDL & PPP loans. The programs contained in the Cares Act have served as critical tools in the battle to support small businesses during this economic crisis. This critical funding has allowed small businesses to retain their employees and keep their doors open. In the 9th District alone, 7,789 PPP loans were administered, supporting 77,343 jobs. Across the Commonwealth, more than 89,000 EIDL loans provided $4.7 billion in assistance for businesses. Helping to get our economy moving back to its record pace is critical to supporting hardworking Americans and small businesses.
Additionally, I conducted a police ride-along with the Lansford Chief of Police Jack Soberick. We discussed the needs and challenges facing law enforcement. Our brave men and women in blue have one of the most difficult jobs in our nation and we owe them a debt of gratitude for the selfless way they put their lives on the line to protect our communities. As part of our visit, I met with Lansford Mayor Michele Bartek and Carbon County District Attorney Mike Greek. In Congress, I will always support our brave law enforcement officers.
Today, I joined the Greater Reading Regional Chamber Alliance for a Congressional candidate briefing. Click here to read an article recounting the event.
On Wednesday night, Vice President Mike Pence delivered a crushing defeat to higher taxes, more job loss, big-government policies, the Green New Deal and a ban on fracking, government-run healthcare, packing the Supreme Court and the Harris-Biden ticket.
The Vice President is a tremendous leader and successfully touted the many successes of President Trump’s America First Agenda. He did an equally great job of taking on the big government, extreme policy agenda of the Harris-Biden ticket. Click here or below to watch the Vice President take on their extreme agenda head-on.
IN NEWS YOU WON’T HEAR IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA: Kamala Harris and Joe Biden refuse to tell the American public the truth about their far-left, extreme agenda.
Kamala Harris \- Most liberal member of the Senate
* Kamala Harris’ radical beliefs should cause every American to worry about her being just one heartbeat away from becoming president.
* Kamala Harris will drastically raise Americans’ taxes, killing the Great American Comeback launched by President Trump:
* If you thought Joe Biden was bad, Kamala Harris said AOC’s radical tax hikes, including a 70 or 80 percent top tax rate, were ""fantastic.""
* Kamala Harris proudly voted against the Trump tax cuts that saved the average middle-class family of four $2,000 a year, and Harris said she would repeal the Trump tax cuts on “day one” – that’s a massive tax hike!
* Kamala Harris will take away Americans’ health care plans:
* Kamala Harris joined Bernie Sanders in introducing his plan for socialized medicine, which would cost over $32 trillion!
* Kamala Harris even said she wants to “eliminate” private insurance plans, saying “let’s move on.”
* That’s even worse than “if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor” – Harris is pledging to take Americans’ whole health care plan away!
* Kamala Harris is a disaster on trade and jobs:
* Kamala Harris is a globalist just like Joe Biden but maybe even worse. Harris voted against the USMCA trade deal and was one of only 10 senators to vote in favor of keeping the failed and job-killing NAFTA deal that Biden championed.
* Kamala Harris would destroy the American energy sector:
* Kamala Harris wants to eliminate all fracking, saying “there’s no question, I’m in favor of banning fracking.”
* Kamala Harris supports the job-killing Green New Deal, saying her version is the “most aggressive and progressive.”
* Kamala Harris is an open-borders radical:
* Kamala Harris is an open-borders radical who raised her hand in support of decriminalizing illegal border crossings.
* Kamala Harris wants to give away government-funded health insurance to illegal aliens.
* Kamala Harris supports sanctuary cities.
* Kamala Harris is weak on crime and bad on cops:
* Kamala Harris has the same crazy weak on crime, anti-police views as Joe Biden.
* Kamala Harris encouraged people to donate to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which bailed rapists, assaulters, and murderers out of jail.
* Kamala Harris supports L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti’s $150 million cut in police funding, and she agrees with the crazy idea to “reimagine” the role of the police.
* Kamala Harris said she was open to giving terrorists and rapists the right to vote from prison.
* Kamala Harris will take away Americans’ Second Amendment rights to keep and bear arms:
* Kamala Harris supports gun confiscation through a “mandatory buyback program” of “as many as 10 million” legally owned firearms.
* Kamala Harris is a total phony:
* Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden in the debate for praising and coddling racist segregationists, but now she turns a blind eye to it because she wants the power.
Joe Biden - Refuses to say he won’t pack the U.S. Supreme Court
* Joe Biden stated he would not tell the American public if he would pack the Supreme Court until the election is over.
* Joe Biden refused to give an answer if he would pack the Supreme Court at his debate with President Trump last week, and Kamala Harris refused to give an answer last night in her debate with Vice President Pence.
* Kamala Harris once said, “I'm open to this conversation about extending the number of people in the United States Supreme Court.”
Packing the Supreme Court removes the third branch of our system of checks and balances. A liberal court, packed by a far-left executive branch, will effectively torch our U.S. Constitution. This has become the most important issue in this election and we must all help assure all Americans understand the magnitude of what the Neo Democrats are planning.
Joe Biden owes the American people an answer on this issue before they cast their ballots. How can Americans vote for a candidate who refuses to tell how he will govern the nation? This is just another attempt by the Harris-Biden ticket to hide their far-left extreme agenda from voters… and worse yet, the mainstream media is letting them get away with it.
This was an exciting week and I love being home in the District. If you would like to show support for our campaign by putting up a yard sign, please feel free to contact us at [[URL REDACTED]]
Thank you and I hope to see you soon,

Good afternoon and welcome to our Week-End Update.
First, I want to take a moment to remember Schuylkill County Commissioner Frank Staudenmeier, who passed away last weekend. Frank was a dedicated public servant and a leader in the community. We all send our heartfelt condolences to Frank’s family, friends and all of Schuylkill County.
On Monday, I attended the AIPAC Policy Conference in Washington, the largest gathering of America’s pro-Israel community. We must always stand with Israel, our nation’s greatest ally in the Middle East, and fight back against Antisemitism in all capacities. (Pictured below with Congressman Fred Keller.)
The coronavirus is dominating the news and President Trump, Vice President Pence and Congress are making every resource available to combat this illness. I attended a White House Coronavirus Briefing with Vice President Mike Pence. The administration has implemented new travel restrictions and has sped up testing. This week, President Trump signed an $8.3 billion spending bill aimed at fighting the coronavirus outbreak that Congress sent to the White House to provide funds to federal agencies, as well as state and local governments, to battle the disease. If you are concerned that you or a loved one may be infected, please follow the CDC guidelines below.
This week, I conducted interviews on SiriusXM Patriot on The Wilkow Majority and with Newsmax to preview President Trump’s trip to Scranton and Fox News Channel Town Hall.
I traveled with President Trump on Air Force One to attend the Fox News Town Hall. The president’s message of optimism and his America First agenda continue to resonate with the people of the 9th District. President Trump’s conservative policies have re-energized what had been a stagnant economy and reversed the failed policies of previous administrations that left many Americans behind.
His leadership has led to record economic gains, including the lowest unemployment rate in half a century. After years of meager wage growth, workers are seeing their fastest wage gains in a decade and manufacturing jobs are growing at the fastest rate in more than three decades. In Pennsylvania alone, the economy has added 162,000 new jobs since 2016.
President Trump has also been a champion for our region’s energy industry. The Administration’s efforts to repeal costly regulations have ensured that family-sustaining jobs in the coal and natural gas industries will be attainable for generations to come. I look forward to continuing this important work on behalf of hardworking Pennsylvanians in Congress. (Pictured below on Air Force One, with President Trump and White House Senior Advisor Kellyanne Conway)
On Saturday, I attended the PA for Human Life Prayer Breakfast. Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon served as the special guest.
Later our campaign attended the GOP’s Stars & Stripes Gala in Montour County. Chairwoman Gunther ran an excellent event and raised over $1,000 for the Montour County Veteran’s Affairs Program. Special congratulations to Barb Fenstermaker, who won the Trump bear.
The Democratic presidential contest rolled through Super Tuesday (or ""Super Thursday"" if you are Joe Biden), and there has been considerable movement in the race as Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Mike Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the race. Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke dropped out and endorsed Joe Biden the day before Super Tuesday as the Democrat establishment is doing anything to stop Bernie Sanders. So far, their efforts have paid off as Joe Biden currently leads the race against Bernie Sanders after a strong showing on Tuesday. Below we have our political cartoon of the week, which I believe sums up the Democratic primary this week.
IN NEWS YOU WON’T READ IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA: Whether it is Bernie or Biden, one thing that won’t change is both the candidate’s desire to embrace socialist policies and a big-government agenda. The Democratic Party leadership will be working to have you believe their chosen candidate Joe Biden is moderate and a good bet for Pennsylvanians. However, his record says otherwise.
* Opposition to fracking means 600,000 jobs lost in Pennsylvania
* Wants to eliminate coal in the United States
* Supports a carbon tax and adding to the cost of fueling cars and heating our homes
* Supports criminal aliens over law enforcement and would not build a wall or secure the southern border
* Called Obama-era deportations ""a mistake""
* Put Beto O'Rourke in charge of guns after he said, ""Hell yeah, we're taking away your AR-15""
* Promises to protect and build on failed Obamacare
* Raise taxes $3.4 trillion including individual taxes
* Spends $1.7 trillion on the Green New Deal
* Opposed the raid to kill Osama Bin Laden and would not have killed Qasem Soleimani, either
* Crafted ""tough on crime"" bills for decades with misguided policies that must now be corrected
Meanwhile, let's look at President Trump's record as it pertains to the Keystone State:
* 162,000 jobs created in Pennsylvanians since 2017, unemployment has dropped 1 percentage point
* Under President Trump, 6,000 jobs added in northeastern Pennsylvania - 2,000 manufacturing jobs
* Pennsylvania's new business applications increased 21% since President Trump's election
* Pennsylvania businesses are excited for USMCA. Trade with Canada and Mexico contributes $15 billion to our economy, 40% of PA global exports
* Fracking supports 600,000 jobs in PA
* Pennsylvania ranks 2nd in natural gas production
* Pennsylvania ranks 3rd in coal production, turning out 49,883,000 tons of coal in 2018
* Sanctuary city Philadelphia's Fraternal Order of Police endorsed President Trump in 2016
The stakes for Pennsylvania and the nation could not be higher in 2020\. We must ensure Pennsylvania votes for President Trump and that Republicans win back control of the U.S. House of Representatives. The stakes are just too high.
Thank you and we will see you soon,

Good afternoon and welcome to our weekend update.
Yesterday, we celebrated Women Veterans Recognition Day and I again want to honor the brave women who have served our nation in the armed forces. Thank you for your sacrifice in defending our freedom.
As it has been dominating the news, I want to address the latest on the new policy plank adopted by the extreme left advocating for defunding the police. The left has adopted some extremely radical positions over the last few years... including a push for government-run health care, the federal government takeover of elections, no border security and the “ganGreen New Deal” that will kill tens of thousands of jobs. Still, no policy has been more radical than the push to defund law enforcement.
What occurred with Mr. George Floyd was reprehensible. Witnessing what is happening in our cities across the country is also reprehensible. While the overwhelming majority of our police officers are excellent, there is no doubt there is a need to look at reforms to improve our law enforcement through transparency, accountability and information exchange. However, burning down cities and businesses, hurting citizens and police officers, will not solve the problem but makes them a lot worse. Our law enforcement officers serve as the thin blue line that protects our communities and our families. These officers leave their homes every day not knowing if they are going to come home when their shift ends.
One of the worst scenes playing out in the nation is occurring in Seattle. Protestors have taken over a section of the city, including the illegal seizure of a police precinct. This has not allowed law enforcement to respond to the calls in a timely fashion and report to calls from citizens dealing with violent crimes, including rapes and assaults. Seattle Police have confirmed that the number of 911 calls has tripled in the occupied area since the police precinct was seized. This is lawlessness and is doing nothing to advance reforms for law enforcement.
In efforts to continue to keep our district updated on the latest happenings, I conducted a number of interviews this week. I appeared on Fox News Business to discuss the protests. Watch my interview by clicking here or below.
Additionally, I conducted an interview on Newsmax TV, where we touched on similar topics and discussed the SCAM Act, legislation I have sponsored to punish those individuals praying on our seniors and the most vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. The moderator raised the push by some in Democratic leadership, particularly Speaker Nancy Pelosi, to remove the statues of historical figures. I said that Democratic leaders should be careful assigning blame, particularly when all of the symbols they are discussing are Democrats. Granted yesteryear Democrats, as is all history. That's the point. It's history.
I am a Republican, but more importantly, I am an American that believes in our Declaration of Independence, which can be said is the 'Why' of the birth of our nation and a believer in the Constitution, which describes the 'How.' It was the Republican Party that ensured that all people are created equal and should be free. My interview can be watched by clicking here or below.
This week, Congressman Fred Keller and I visited Brian Campbell's farm in Berwick, who is participating in the new USDA Farmers to Families Food Box Program to benefit the Central PA Food Bank and the countless families they serve. This program allows the USDA to purchase up to $3 billion of fresh produce, dairy and meat products. This new program has been vital to both our agriculture partners as well as the charitable food network as we have seen over a 45% increase in demand since the beginning of the COVID crisis throughout our network.
We conducted a Zoom call with leaders in the construction industry for a status update on their activities now that they have been able to get back to work and ways we can support their efforts to hire employees and build important infrastructure for our communities.
I participated in a Veterans Affairs Committee meeting regarding the coronavirus and I want to thank the Veterans Administration for the great job they did during the Covid-19 pandemic to help support our veterans. The VA didn't just talk about following the data, they actually did it. They saw who was high risk and the factors that were contributing to those situations and focused their resources there. They have achieved excellent results supporting our veteran community during this crisis.
On Thursday, I spoke at the Carbon County Chamber's ""State of the County"" presentation at Blue Mountain Resort in Palmerton. Thank you to the many stakeholders from the private and public sectors who work hard to make Northeast PA a great place to live and work. Together, we will get through this crisis and back on a path towards prosperity. We also appreciate their ingenuity in presenting an in-person/virtual event that was safe and well-attended.
Later, I participated in a Pennsylvania Trump Team Zoom call with our new Republican nominee for Congress in the 8th District, Jim Bognet. Lastly, I want to address some news in Harrisburg. Speaker of the House Mike Turzai announced his decision to resign on June 15. Over the course of my service as the former Secretary of the Department of Revenue and now as Congressman, I was fortunate to work closely with Mike on many important issues for our Commonwealth. Mike is a leader, problem-solver and shares our conservative values. I want to thank Mike for his service and wish Mike and his family the best in their future endeavors. (Below pictured with Speaker Mike Turzai at an event last year in Berks County)
Have a great weekend, stay safe and we will see you soon.

Alex \--
Good afternoon and welcome to our Weekend Update.
This was a great week on the campaign trail as we work to ensure Pennsylvania delivers all 20 electoral votes to President Trump again in 2020.
On Thursday, I attended a Sportsmen for Trump Rally with Donald Trump, Jr. and Trump Victory Finance National Chair Kimberly Guilfoyle hosted by Bill and Laura Bachenberg at the Lehigh Valley Sporting Clays. The event included a rally for law enforcement and a separate rally for sportsmen. It was a tremendous event and Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle do an incredible job highlighting the countless reasons we must reelect President Trump.
One of the main reasons we back the President is his steadfast support of our Constitution and, in particular, our 2nd Amendment. I want to remind you that Joe Biden wants to put anti-2nd Amendment radical Beto O’Rourke in charge of our gun policies and Kamala Harris wants to institute a mandatory gun buyback program for the nation.
I got the opportunity to address the crowd. President Trump will win Pennsylvania again largely because he hasn't lost support from the voters and delivered for Pennsylvania the best economy we have seen in over 70 years. He did it once and he will do it again. Who would we prefer steering our economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic? Donald J. Trump or Sleepy Joe Biden? Their capabilities are about as different as shooting a bullet as opposed to throwing one. Pictured below with Donald Trump, Jr., Kimberly Guilfoyle, Brian and his wife Val Rich, my shooting buddy and good friend Chuck Coccodrilli, and my wife Shelley.
This week we attended the Schuylkill Transportation System facility groundbreaking in Saint Clair. Bob Carl, President and CEO of the Schuylkill County Chamber of Commerce, did a great job hosting the event.
This morning, we attended State Representative Doyle Heffley’s golf outing. (Pictured below).
On Sunday, I am attending the Rally at the Rock with Bradford County Commissioner Doug McLinko.
In Lebanon County, Governor Tom Wolf and the Lebanon County Commissioners agreed to a settlement with regard to appropriated CARES Act funding. First of all, I want to reiterate that I believe the Governor’s office exceeded its authority by failing to release CARES Act funding to Lebanon County. I was encouraged that our local elected officials stood up and challenged the Governor’s inconsistent orders and mandates that unfairly hurt small businesses.
Unfortunately, the settlement reached yesterday by the Governor and the County further perpetuates the unfair political attack against the residents of Lebanon County. As part of the Governor's agreement, he mandated that $2.8 million of this critical funding be used for a public relations campaign to encourage mask-wearing in Lebanon County. All of this funding was intended to help businesses open, provide assistance for our schools and support our frontline worker... They were NOT meant to be used for a public relations campaign. To siphon off $2.8 million of that critical funding on a campaign to encourage individuals to wear masks is excessive, wasteful and hurts the Lebanon County residents meant to receive this support. This Governor has proven time and time again that he favors petty politics over the interests of the hardworking people of Lebanon County. It’s a mindboggling decision made during a pandemic.
In major news, President Trump helped to negotiate a historic agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. If the media were not so fixated on defeating President Trump, they would recognize the significance of this news. The agreement will help to fully normalize relations between the two countries. This is incredible news and shows that President Trump’s diplomatic efforts in the region are having an impact. President Trump is focused on making our nation and our world a safer place. His policies and diplomacy are working.
IN NEWS YOU WON’T READ IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA: Despite what the major news outlets would have you believe, Senator Kamala Harris is not a moderate. Joe Biden’s pick for Vice President, Kamala Harris, has embraced the radical policies of the far left:
*     * Harris and Biden both support a ban and would eliminate the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania and the United States
* Harris was one of the first Democrats to co-sponsor Bernie Sanders’ single-payer Medicare for All, which would cost over $32 trillion, and said she wanted to eliminate private insurance even if individuals like their plan
* Harris is a co-sponsor of the radical Green New Deal, voted against the Trump tax cuts, and voted against a bill that would limit abortions to the first 20 weeks of pregnancy
* Harris has even said that we should have a “conversation” about whether felons should vote from prison
* Harris has endorsed the far-left’s immigration policies that are tantamount to open borders
* Harris supports sanctuary cities and said in 2018 that “we need to probably think about starting from scratch” when referring to ICE
* Harris is out of touch, using her office and personal connections to benefit herself. She ran up bills in her role as Attorney General that puts her in former Lt. Governor Mike Stack category here in Pennsylvania:
* During 2017 and 2018, Harris received “unprecedented” protection from the Los Angeles Police Department even when not in Los Angeles, costing taxpayers over $28,000
* During her 2016 campaign, Harris used campaign funds to pay for things like a stay at an upscale, $3,400 a night hotel and $20,000 on luxury car services
* Harris was more focused on playing politics than fighting crime as a prosecutor, with San Francisco’s homicide rates rising when Harris was the city’s District Attorney:
* As DA, Harris inflated the office’s conviction rate by offering plea deals to defendants accused of serious crimes
* When cases went to trial, Harris’ office underperformed compared to other prosecutors
Joe Biden's decision to select Kamala Harris as his running mate proves once again that he has completely caved to the extreme left-wing of the Democratic Party. Kamala Harris was rated the most liberal U.S. Senator in 2019, which is quite the accomplishment when you consider she is competing against the likes of Bernie Sanders, Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren. Fortunately, Biden is giving the American people a clear sign of what kind of President he would be. Radical left.
The Biden-Harris ticket has as much in common with eastern central Pennsylvania as I do with San Francisco.
Last night, I attended a Back the Blue Dinner hosted by our friend, Lebanon County District Attorney Pier Hess Graf. This was a fantastic event and the proceeds collected all went to benefit PA COPS. PA COPS provides resources to assist families and affected coworkers of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. The guest speaker was Trish Wertz. Her husband was killed in the line of duty in Berks County. Wertz is a courageous advocate for our law enforcement officers and understands the sacrifices our police and their families make to keep our communities safe. I want to thank her and Pier Hess Graf for their work to support law enforcement. Pictured below with Trish Wertz and Rep. Sue Helm.
With campaign season here, we are working on getting our message out. We have a new billboard near exit 74 on Pennsylvania Turnpike 476 (Northeast Extension). Keep American & Pennsylvania Great! Our yard signs are beginning to go up. If you need a yard sign, please contact our campaign at [[URL REDACTED]] Pictured below with Donny, Ty and Jimmy.
Yesterday, my wife and I checked our son Danny into Bucknell University. My boy is now a college man. I am very thankful that we have such great universities in Pennsylvania, so he is not too far from home. I want to wish all of our students, their parents and families well as we safely get back to school during these challenging times.
Please have a great weekend and we will see you soon.

Alex --
Good afternoon and welcome to our Week-End Update.
The acquittal of President Donald Trump, the State of the Union Address, the Iowa Caucuses…there was no shortage of significant events to discuss this week.
The U.S. Senate voted down the impeachment on Wednesday. This mercifully ends what has been a baseless and reckless witch hunt led by Democratic Leadership, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Congressmen Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. This was such a stinging defeat for the Democratic leadership, and even the Washington Post was forced to finally print the truth about President Donald Trump – a headline that reads “Trump Acquitted.”
Our Founding Fathers never meant to have impeachment weaponized like it was by Democratic leadership over the past few months. In response, U.S. Senator Rick Scott has sponsored a Congressional Amendment to raise the threshold in the U.S. House for impeachment. I support this effort as we can never allow impeachment to be used as a political tool ever again.
Since gaining the majority in 2018, the House Democrat majority has obsessed overdoing one thing: impeaching a President despite the absence of evidence. Their purely political agenda consumed precious taxpayer money and distracted Congress from doing the work of the people.
As the Democratic Party mourned the death of the impeachment sham, the President’s State of the Union address highlighted the strength of our nation. The President detailed the dramatic results of his policies over the last three years and articulated an optimistic and ambitious agenda for 2020 and our country this decade. Pro-growth policies have created a booming economy, our military is stronger and more prepared than any time in our nation’s history, and we are beginning to see the results of our efforts to curb drug overdoses, as the rate of deaths has declined for the first time in decades. These are real results and prime examples of where President Trump has disproved conventional wisdom and set our country on a path to Make Our America Even Greater. (Pictured below with the President, high-fiving Congressman Mark Meadows and with colleagues)
I interviewed with WFMZ. Click the link below to watch my interview.
Unfortunately, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and most of the Democratic Caucus sat on their hands as President Trump outlined the success of our nation. Speaker Pelosi then went even farther by deliberately tearing the President’s State of the Union Address apart on national television. It happened no less than 25 feet in front of where I was sitting.
Pelosi's actions were unbecoming of the Speaker of the House and, frankly, for an adult. No adult finds such juvenile behavior admirable, only destructive. In doing this, Speaker Pelosi violated House Rules, so today House Republicans brought a resolution admonishing her actions to the floor. Sadly, every Democrat member voted to block, allowing debate on this resolution. If the United States Congress cannot hold this sort of divisive behavior accountable, how can the American people trust Democrat leadership? Obviously, they cannot.
To me, her actions served as a clear declaration that Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leadership have no desire or intentions to try to work together on anything.
Over the past three days, I have traveled around the District attending over half a dozen events and never before I have I seen such an agitation with so many people upset about Speaker Pelosi tearing up President Trump's speech. I have had dozens, including many Democrats, approach me with their heads shaking, saying her behavior was unacceptable and terrible. Every one of them are convinced she needs to go and the only way to accomplish that goal is to get her out is for Republicans to win back the House.
This week, our country became safer as our armed forces successfully took out another dangerous terrorist. On Thursday, the White House announced that Qassim al-Rimi, leader of the terror group, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, was killed in an airstrike in Yemen.  Al-Rimi was a founder of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and has taken responsibility for the deaths of countless. Additionally, he took credit for last year’s deadly shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola, where a Saudi aviation trainee killed three American sailors. The world is a much safer place without al-Rimi.
This week, the primary race for the Democratic nomination for President began in Iowa. However, just like each Democratic presidential debate, it began and ended in disaster. First, the Iowa Democratic Party has been unable to get an accurate count. The Associated Press has announced that they failed to declare a winner of Iowa’s Democratic caucuses because of irregularities in the process. Like the 2016 election, I assume they will challenge the outcome of this election as well. In fact, we heard the Iowa Democratic Party even attempted to get an expert, Count von Count from Sesame Street, to come in to assist in the tally. (See below)
In all seriousness, the Democratic Presidential contest has been an embarrassment… not because of a failed count or the debate rules, but because of their failed socialist policy ideas.
In News You Won’t Hear In The Mainstream Media: Under President Trump’s leadership, our nation is on a roll. Please don’t take it from me… listen to the voters.
* Americans’ economic optimism just hit a record 44-year high—better than under Presidents Reagan, Clinton, or Obama. That confidence is buoyed by an unemployment rate near 50-year lows, a record stock market, and plummeting income inequality as blue-collar wage gains outpace white-collar ones.
* More people are satisfied with how things are going in the United States than at any point in the past 15 years. Besides the soaring economy, violent crime rates are down, and American strength grows as terror leaders are brought to justice.
* A record-breaking 90 percent of Americans are satisfied with their personal life. “It's likely no coincidence that Americans' heightened satisfaction with their personal life comes as confidence in the U.S. economy and their personal finances are also at long-term or record highs,” Gallup writes.
To top it off: While Democrat leaders fume and rip up speeches, the rest of the country is giving President Trump his highest approval rating yet.
Click below to watch an enthusiastic Trump supporter talk about her support.
By contrast, watch this clip from a New Hampshire father schooling Democratic Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren on her plan to eliminate student loans.
He rightfully asked why those who do the right things, like saving for their children’s education, will have to subsidize another parent who didn’t. Warren has no answer because this socialist policy, like all of them, is wrongheaded and unfair.
This week, on Monday, I conducted a radio interview on WPPA's Step up to the Mic in Pottsville. On Tuesday, I attended Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf's budget address, where I was able to catch up with many friends in Harrisburg. On Thursday, I attended President Trump's speech at the National Prayer Breakfast.
This week, I sponsored legislation, H.R. 5761, the Advancing Uniform Transportation Opportunities for Veterans (AUTO) Act. This bill will increase access to the Department of Veterans Affairs Automobile Grant. Qualifying veterans could receive a second grant ten years after receiving the first grant. Currently, veterans are only able to receive the grant once-per-lifetime. These brave men and women sacrificed much in defense of our nation and we owe it to them to do everything in our power to provide them with the services they need now.
Report from the Campaign Trail:
Last Sunday, I attended the Southern Luzerne 1st District Republican Brunch in Hazleton. I want to thank our good friend State Representative Tarah Toohil, for inviting us to speak. I want to congratulate Frances Petrovich, who was honored as the Distinguished Republican of the Year. (Pictured below)
We attended a Women for Trump event with Vice President Mike Pence in Cumberland County. This event illustrated the great enthusiasm that exists around the Commonwealth for the Trump Campaign. People are pumped and ready to get to work to get President Trump and Pence reelected. We can accomplish that almost singlehandedly by ensuring Pennsylvania goes Red in 2020.
As you know, I am running for reelection this year, and our campaign is right in the middle of petition collection. My campaign must secure a minimum of 1,000 signatures. Our goal is to submit many more signatures than are required. Our team has and continues to be on the trail, working to collect as many signatures as possible.
Yesterday, I served as the keynote speaker at the Northampton County GOP Annual Lincoln Day Breakfast this morning. The crowd was enthusiastic and ready to help reelect President Trump and win back control of the U.S. House in 2020. (Pictured below with the Northampton GOP leadership and members)
Our team attended the Luzerne County Republican Lincoln Day Breakfast.
Yesterday afternoon, we attended the Pottsville Winterfest. (Pictures below with supporters including our good friend Ron Downey)
We closed out yesterday at a petition signing event with State Representative Karen Boback at the home of Tom and Andrea Mosca. Thanks to all for hosting and for the countless who have signed petitions.
Today, we are with State Representative Doyle Heffley and other local candidates for a Support Team Trump To Keep America Great petition signing event in Primary Campaign Office in Lehighton.
As a reminder, as this is an election year, we have begun circulating petitions to run for reelection to Congress. Petition circulation concludes on February 17. If you would like to join our team, please let us know. For copies of petitions, questions or information regarding petition events across the District or to arrange petition pick-up, please contact our Field Campaign Manager Rob Bresnahan at [[URL REDACTED]]
Lastly, Shelley and I would like to introduce our new puppy and we are pleased to welcome them to the Meuser family.
Thank you and we will see you soon,

Alex \--
Good evening and welcome to our Weekend Update.
Campaign stops, town halls, confirmation hearings, special events, farm tours, a police ride-along and much more were all packed into a very busy week.
Today, we welcomed Vice President Mike Pence to the 9th Congressional District at the Reading Regional Airport.
Before the Vice President arrived, I was able to address the crowd and let them know why I believe President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are going to win Pennsylvania again. We need them to Make America Great Again... Again. Click here or below to watch my remarks.
The Vice President was tremendous. He spoke about the America First agenda and the countless successes the Administration has accomplished over the last four years, including helping to build one of the greatest economies our nation has ever witnessed. He also spoke about the stark choice Americans face on Election Day. The Harris-Biden ticket is running on the most extreme left-wing agenda in the history of our nation. Higher taxes, banning fracking, packing the courts, open borders, government-run health care... their liberal wishlist goes on and on. It is critical that everyone turn out and vote for President Trump and Vice President Pence and help us deliver a Republican-led majority to the U.S. House. The future prosperity of our nation hinges on the results of November 3. Don't take my word for it, listen to the Vice President by clicking here or on the picture below.
We were joined by so many friends, including Pennsylvania Trump-Pence Chair Bernie Comfort. (Pictured below)
As well as my friends, fellow Congressman Lloyd Smucker and Berks County Commissioner Christian Leinbach. (Pictured below)
In the U.S. Senate, confirmation hearings on Judge Amy Coney Barrett began. Fighting off ridiculous attacks from Democrat Senators, Judge Barrett showed why President Trump nominated her to the Supreme Court. She has the judicial temperament, experience and qualifications to serve our nation on our highest court. She will interpret the laws and follow the U.S. Constitution. I believe she will make an excellent addition to the U.S. Supreme Court.
On Thursday night, we witnessed two very different town halls play out on national television. President Donald Trump conducted a town hall in primetime on NBC where he faced tough questions on the major issues facing our nation. While the debate was canceled, it was clear that NBC planned to have Savannah Guthrie “stand-in” for Joe Biden. While she attacked the President, he didn't back down. He answered how his administration has advanced the America First Agenda while tackling tough issues like Covid-19 and illegal immigration.
Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden held a town hall primetime on ABC with George Propagandopolis. What did the American people get? Softball questions and lies. Zero questions about his son Hunter Biden’s involvement with being paid large sums of money from foreign emissaries to arrange meetings with his father who was serving as the Vice President at the time.
Despite not having to answer the difficult questions, Biden still shamelessly lied about his record… over and over again.
IN NEWS YOU WON’T HEAR IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA: Joe Biden used his national platform to lie and misrepresent his positions multiple times…
He lied about the:
* Vaccine \- Joe said a vaccine won’t be ready until next year. The truth is that the CDC and Dr. Fauci said a vaccine is possible by the end of the year.
* Raising Taxes \- Joe said that anyone making less than $400,000 a year won’t see a tax increase under his plan. The truth is that Biden’s $4 trillion tax hike will raise taxes on 82% of Americans, including those making under $400,000.
* Crime Bill \- Joe said the crime bill does not have mandatory sentences. The truth is that the Crime Bill Biden authored included a “three strikes” provision that led to mandatory life sentences.
* Fracking \- Joe said he would not ban fracking. The truth is that Biden repeatedly expressed his support for banning fracking and eliminating the fossil fuel industry.
To highlight Joe’s problems with the truth, our campaign has put together the following video of clips of his contradictions and lies. This is evidence that deserves a verdict. Please click here or below to watch.
On Monday, I joined the Bloomsburg Police Chief Roger Van Loan for a ride-along during his patrol in Bloomsburg. I also had the opportunity to tour the Bloomsburg police station and meet with members of the department. Thank you to our brave men and women in blue who keep our communities safe!
Earlier this week, I appeared on the Sam Lesante Show (Pictured Below) and conducted an interview with the Citizens’ Voice editorial board. We will post each of those interviews when they are made public.
I appeared on Fox Business’s Varney & Co. to discuss the negative impact of the Biden-Harris economic agenda, Biden’s plans to pack the courts and why I believe President Trump will win Pennsylvania again. Click here or below to watch my interview.
On Thursday, I traveled to Shamokin to join State Rep. Kurt Masser for a lunch with local veterans. As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee in Congress, I am dedicated to ensuring that those who have served our nation receive the care and benefits they have earned.
One thing that I particularly enjoy is visiting with all my close friends at the various county party GOP fall dinners throughout the District and Commonwealth. On Tuesday, I spoke at the Berks County GOP Dinner. I want to thank Chairman Clay Breece and the members and supporters of the Berks County GOP for attending. We must ensure Berks County goes Red this year for President Trump.
On Wednesday, I joined my friend and former White House Press Secretary and Communications Director Sean Spicer at the Lebanon County Republican Fall Dinner. Sean delivered an insider view of President Trump. Each guest also got a copy of Sean’s new book, Leading America, President Trump’s Commitment to People, Patriotism and Capitalism. I would encourage everyone to check out that book. Chairman Ed Lynch and the Lebanon County Republican Committee hosted a wonderful event.
On Thursday, I met up with Vice President Pence’s nephew John Pence in Schuylkill County. Another tremendous event. The excitement and energy continue to build for the Trump-Pence ticket.
Later that evening, we held a tremendously successful fundraiser in Luzerne County. I want to thank everyone who supported our campaign, especially our many hosts.
This week, I received the Friend of Farm Bureau Award from the American Farm Bureau Federation. Agriculture is one of the leading industries in Pennsylvania, providing thousands of family-sustaining jobs. Yesterday, we visited a number of family farms across the District. At each stop, we toured their facilities and conducted a roundtable discussion on the various issues impacting the agricultural industry. In Congress, I will continue to work for our farmers, ensuring a future filled with increased opportunity and prosperity for those who help feed America. We began our day with a stop at the J.C. Hill Tree Farm in Orwigsburg with owner Jeff Hill. At our second stop, we joined William Palmer at the WT Palmer and Son Beef Farm in Shartlesville. Our final stop was at Carl Weidler’s Dairy in Palmyra.
I want to thank all of our farm families for the work they do and for hosting these important roundtables today. Having an open line of communication and discussing these critically important issues helps to guide me as we make decisions in Washington to support our agricultural industry. I would like also to send out a special thanks to Mike Firestine, Chairman of the Pennsylvania AG Republicans for joining us on the tour as well as for his continued support, counsel and friendship.
As part of our efforts to reach out to voters prior to Election Day, we conducted candidate interviews on many of the local news stations. Click here or below to watch my interview on CBS-21.
Click here or below to watch my candidate interview on Fox 43.
Our campaign also announced that we received the endorsement of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Last but not least, earlier this year, I stood with Taste of Sicily in Palmyra who opened their doors in defiance of the Governor’s Covid-19 restrictions. Today, they successfully fought back against the excessive fines imposed on them by the government and won. A Judge found Taste of Sicily NOT GUILTY and they do not have to pay any of the ridiculous fines.
I fully support efforts to keep people safe, but the government should not force a small business to choose between operating safely to support your family or closing your doors forever.
The liberties guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution are not fair-weather liberties. They exist during good times and challenging times.

Corky Greets President Trump, Gets Shout-Out from the Commander-in-Chief
Alternate text
Corky was among hundreds of enthusiastic Granite Staters Friday night at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport when President Donald Trump touched down in Air Force One. With the presidential plane as his backdrop, the President spoke at length about the issues facing the nation. He was at times jocular and often serious, as he blasted his Democrat opponent, Joe Biden, and predicted a Trump win in November.
During his speech, he made special mention of Corky and his run for U.S. Senate, pointing to Corky in the crowd and telling him, “I heard you’re doing well, Corky!” Here’s the moment!
Alternate text
Before the President’s arrival, Corky spoke to the assembled crowd, saying how honored he was to be among those greeting the President. He also recounted the story of the day Mr. Trump endorsed his Senate run, and then the next day, the President was at West Point, congratulating Corky’s elder son, who was among the graduating cadets. “It was a special 24 hours for the Messner family,” he said, continuing, “and the way we’re going to thank President Trump for this endorsement is twofold: we are going to retire Jeanne Shaheen and retire her to her home to York, Maine…And we’re going to help President Trump win the four electoral votes in New Hampshire.”
WMUR-Channel 9 U.S. Senate Debate Airs Sept. 1
Alternate text
Be sure to tune in as WMUR-Channel 9 airs a debate featuring Republican U.S. Senate candidates Corky Messner and Don Bolduc, Tuesday, Sept. 1, at 7 p.m. The two canddidates will discuss the issues facing New Hampshire and the nation, and their efforts to unseat incumbent Senator Jeanne Shaheen.
Corky is the Only Candidate for Federal Office Recommended by New Hampshire's Liberty Ballot
Corky Messner is the only candidate for federal office this election year recommended by Liberty Ballot, a New Hampshire organization which supports candidates who champion small government.
Alternate text
“I am honored to be recommended by Liberty Ballot,” says Corky. “This group is dedicated to the idea of small government and self-determination and believes as I do in individual liberty and economic freedom for all Americans. I also am grateful for the support from these State Representatives and other loyal Republicans.”
Liberty Ballot evaluates candidates based on their small government stance and their viability. Those candidates are indicated by a marked ballot on the Liberty Ballot website, which lists ballots by city and town. For example, a Goffstown resident accessing the sample ballot on the Liberty Ballot site will see Corky selected, along with several other candidates.
The evaluation process includes dozens of activists who research ratings, endorsements, and pledges from organizations that include the New Hampshire Liberty Alliance, the Republican Liberty Caucus of New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Firearms Coalition, Gun Owners of New Hampshire, Americans for Prosperity New Hampshire, and New Hampshire Families for Education.
Candidate debates, websites, Facebook pages, literature and interviews also are considered as part of the evaluation process. Additionally, candidate viability is considered.
The Violence Must End, Says Corky, As Senator Paul is Attacked Outside the White House
Commenting on the video showing Kentucky U.S. Senator Rand Paul and his wife being threatened by a mob after leaving the White House the evening of President Trump’s acceptance speech, Corky strongly condemned the continuing unrest and violence in our cities.
Corky was endorsed by Senator Paul a few weeks ago.
“Minneapolis. Portland. Seattle. Washington. How long will the radical left continue to support rioters burning cities to the ground?” asks Corky. “Defunding the police is the LAST thing our communities need right now. They need security, protection, and safety. Not lawlessness and crime.”
He added: “President Trump is working hard to get these mobs under control, but politicians like D.C. Jeanne Shaheen, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer are blocking him at every turn. We cannot allow Senator Shaheen perpetuate the violence and lawlessness across the country any longer.”
More State Representatives and GOP Activists Sign on as Messner Endorsers
Last week, we welcomed a new round of endorsements from State Representatives and noted GOP activists.
Alternate text
They include State Representatives Joe Alexander, Tom Dolan, Tony Lekas, Charlie McMahon, Mark Pearson, Steve Pearson, and Michael Yakobovich. Longtime GOP supporters endorsing Messner include former President of New Hampshire Right to Life Jane Cormier, Trump supporter Chau Kelley of Hooksett, and former N.H. House candidate Tommy Sharpe, Sr. of Windham.
""Having a Senator in Washington who will defend life and liberty is absolutely vital to the future of our Granite State,"" says Cormier. ""Corky Messner will have my vote, and I hope he will have others' as well.""
“I welcome this support as we approach the Sept. 8 primary, and we continue on to face Jeanne Shaheen in November’s general election,” Corky responded “Republicans across the Granite State understand this is a critical contest as we work to return conservative values and common sense to Washington.”

President Trump Endorses Corky Messner’s Run for the U.S. Senate
Alternate text
President Donald Trump has endorsed Corky Messner’s run for the U.S. Senate.
“Corky Messner will be a fantastic Senator for New Hampshire,” says President Trump. “A West Point graduate, he served our country in the Army with distinction. Strong on jobs, crime, veterans, and the Second Amendment. Corky has my complete and total endorsement!”
“I am humbled by the President’s support, and I will provide Granite Staters with the conservative voice they need in the U.S. Senate,” says Corky. “Career politician Jeanne Shaheen has lost touch with the everyday concerns and values of New Hampshire residents, and they can trust me to provide the leadership they need to face the challenges ahead.”
Corky Messner Unveils Plan with a Goal of “Unleashing the Strength of America”
This week, Corky unveiled a blueprint to restore America’s economic prosperity and manufacturing might, preserve individual liberties, and reduce government intrusion and over-regulation.
Alternate text
The Messner USA Plan: Unleashing the Strength of America focuses on three main areas: economic freedom, national security, and individual liberty. You can read the plan on our website.
“We can unleash this nation’s strength, and restore our standing in the world, if we work toward providing economic opportunities and restoring personal liberties for every American,” says Corky, who adds that he stands ready to work with New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu and President Trump “to reignite our American economy, by providing the leadership and the vision we need to move ahead.
“We can emerge from this pandemic, and from these times of social unrest and divisiveness, stronger as a people and as a country. What we need is a common mission and the common sense to restore the United States of America’s standing as a nation that is the envy of the world.”

Corky took questions from a few callers, and spoke about his newly-released USA Plan, the racial and social unrest nationwide, and how New Hampshire is slowly emerging from the pandemic.

Super PAC Will Support Messner Campaign
As WMUR reported this week, the Freedom and Liberty PAC, led by a team of veteran GOP strategists, will work to “ensure Corky Messner wins the primary election in September and defeats Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in November,” according to a statement shared exclusively with WMUR’s New Hampshire Primary Source. The group says it has “already received pledges in the six-figures.”

Yes, It's Official

Alex,
Did you hear about the anarchy in Washington following President Trump's RNC speech?
The radical left decided to riot... and ATTACKED Sen. Rand Paul in the streets.
It's hard to believe that they had the nerve to attack a sitting Senator, but you can see for yourself! Watch the video here.
Invitation
Sen. Rand Paul ATTACKED! Click to Watch.
Minneapolis. Portland. Seattle. Washington. How long will the radical left continue to support rioters burning cities to the ground?
Defunding the police is the LAST thing our communities need right now. They need security, protection, and safety. Not lawlessness and crime.
President Trump is working hard to get these mobs under control, but politicians like D.C. Jeanne Shaheen, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer are blocking him at every turn.
Don't let Shaheen perpetuate the violence and lawlessness across the country any longer. Contribute now to help Corky DEFEAT her, and be an ally for President Trump.

Hello,
I'd like to tell you a story about Jon that you may not know. Nearly three years ago, I began doing some work in the community to stop domestic violence. A woman and her four-year old child had been murdered by her ex-boyfriend, who then killed himself. The case made an imprint on me. A mother and her child were dead. There was a vigil and some media coverage of the deaths, but nobody seemed to be asking many questions.
I had been prosecuting domestic violence cases for about four years at that time and believed more could be done in the community to stop interpersonal violence. I began meeting with experts in the field in Kalamazoo and throughout Michigan, learning about the role that trauma, and witnessing or experiencing violence as a child has on people who go on to become abusive themselves. I learned that suffering trauma is the leading indicator that a person will hurt someone else.
First, we wrestled with the question of which action or set of actions to take to create real change in the community. We knew that trauma contributed significantly to interpersonal violence in the community, but we weren't sure how to address it. After much discussion, the answer came in the form of a new treatment court - a court that treated trauma as a root cause of crime and family violence. Just as Drug Courts treat addiction to reduce crime and recidivism, this court program would treat trauma to reduce violence perpetration. The concept became known as the Kalamazoo County Trauma & Resiliency Court, a first of its kind endeavor in our country.
Next, we were faced with the question of where to turn to provide funding for trauma survivors and their families. Treatment for trauma survivors would help reduce interpersonal violence in the community, but as we all know, treatment costs money. And trauma survivors often lack the resources to pay for quality treatment out of pocket. Particularly, the kind of treatment that effectively calms trauma reactivity and heals families in the process.
Jon Hoadley answered the call. I met with Jon to discuss our efforts and he immediately offered to help. He fought for, and won, funding in the state legislature to create the new treatment court program in Kalamazoo County.
The Trauma & Resiliency Court program will fundamentally change the way we understand and treat trauma survivors in the community, offering survivors help and healing, instead of more pain and punishment. It will mean fewer trauma victims and more resilience in and through the justice system.
I want you to know the critical role Jon played in helping trauma survivors in this community. Nobody has ever done anything like this anywhere in the country or, so far as I know, the world. Unfortunately, the voices of trauma survivors are often ignored in the criminal justice system, as this survivor details in this piece. They repeatedly ask for more resources to treat and heal trauma, but are instead given pain and punishment. Jon is helping to end this injustice in Kalamazoo and bend the arc just a little more.
This is yet one more reason to support Jon Hoadley with your time and money. Jon is doing more for trauma survivors in this community than Upton ever has or ever will. He is quietly, but fundamentally, changing the way we view and treat survivors in the justice system.
I hope you’ll join me in supporting Jon’s campaign.
In politics these days, we too often see the mean and the ugly, the distortion of truth, hurtful words and misdeeds that have come to define the Trump era. Upton, through the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), benefits from this kind of politics.
Jon is different. Jon cares about people. Jon cares about this community. He's fighting for Kalamazoo in Lansing each and every day, and will do the same in Washington, D.C. when we send him to Congress this November. Let's help him get there.
I know this was a long email. If you've gotten to this line, thank you. Let's give Jon the best thanks we can in the coming weeks by voting to retire Upton.
Sincerely yours,
Joe

219,"America is a great country. And part of our collective greatness stems from our ability to reckon with the past, blemishes and all. To reflect and move forward, to work together year after year, to build a more perfect union.
But much of our past cannot be sugar-coated. Not all that long ago, black and brown Americans were faced with the specter of violence in their daily lives. Unspeakable and public acts of cruelty, torture, and murder were perpetrated on men, women, and children who dared to speak out or take action to better their lives.
The threat of white supremacist lynching terrorized families for generations and kept millions as second class citizens in their own country and communities.
Today, in a rare act of bipartisanship, the House of Representatives did the right thing. They passed the Emmet Till Antilynching Act with a vote of 410-4 -- sending the message that America will never return to the days of accepting race-based violence and terror.
That’s why I was ashamed to see how my own congressman, conservative Justin Amash voted: against the bill.
This vote is only the latest example of Congressman Amash putting conservative ideology before doing what’s right.
And let’s be clear: at a time of great division, with hate crimes on the rise and race-baiting rhetoric infecting our electoral system, united stands against hate like this are needed now more than ever.
This isn’t about politics or ordinary disagreements about policy. This is about doing the right thing when the world is watching.
Amash didn’t. When I get to Congress, I will.
Together,
Hillary

I would be honored to have your vote today and I promise you, I will NEVER let you down.
❤️ 🇺🇸 🙏🙏🇺🇸 ❤️
I will NEVER ever take PAC money or any Special Interest Group money. I will challenge Big Pharma and the healthcare ecosystem to make things better for every American. I will challenge the system and seek to change the culture of Washington - make things better. I will be accessible and available to you, open to your suggestions and ideas. It will be a collaborative effort of solving the tough challenges of our district. Thank you for your support.
In gratitude,
\- Rishi Kumar
\----- My closing statement as the polls close -------
On March 3rd, 2019, we launched our campaign to change the culture of Washington by going door to door in Los Altos, having conversations with neighbors about healthcare.
Since then, we’ve held town halls in every city across the district--3 meetings per month--and gained new endorsements from district residents. I have walked neighborhoods in each of the 31 cities of our district and met with neighbors to understand their specific challenges. I am proud of what Team Rishi has accomplished over the last year. We have delved into the issues of concern to our neighbors, and have laid out a new course for Silicon Valley. We have unveiled a clear vision to fix our housing, homelessness and traffic challenges, to create affordable healthcare solutions, and to expand economic opportunities for all. Visit our website, click on Articles to see the various position papers we have put together.
In just a few hours from now, voters will have decided the direction of our district and the future of our country. Our current Representative, Anna Eshoo, has failed to lead us on the critical issues our residents face on a daily basis. She has remained silent on housing and has embraced Big Pharma – taking more money from the pharmaceutical companies than any other candidate for US Congress, while supporting legislation that has increased the price tag for healthcare. I have not seen a plan or a vision from Anna to address our transportation gridlock.
The voice of voters says it all here. The voters of our district want a leader who will fight for their rights and NOT the Special Interest Groups. As a Saratoga City Councilmember, I have pushed to reduce water hikes from San Jose Water, and I fought to reduce crime throughout our city. Real impact, real results! The voters re-elected me with the most votes in city history.
As your next Representative in the U.S. Congress, I will work towards the ""21 counties, 21 minutes"" vision plan that will develop a tunnel based, high speed transportation system to make more housing accessible, address homelessness, and expand the economy. As your congressman, I will work to reduce crime in every city - roll out simple best practices that were very effective in my city. I will look at options to reduce the rising price of healthcare, and I promise you I will NOT be bought by the Pharma industry. We call our campaign of change as standing up for ""your interests, not special interests.""
I will invest in new technology to address the challenges of climate change and expand our clean-tech economy. I will make sure our public schools have the right funding, new curriculum, and technology to prepare our children for the jobs of tomorrow. And I will NEVER accept PAC money or Special Interest Group money, keeping my allegiance only with the people.
Together, we can bring real change to Congress. I will be honored to have your vote. Please vote today if you haven't already (before 8pm). How to vote? Details at [[URL REDACTED]]
NOTE: California has a new rule: U.S citizens who are NOT registered to vote can walk into any polling station by 8pm tomorrow, register to vote, then ask for a ballot and vote
I am always open to learning. I will see you soon at our next town hall meeting later this month.

223,"Hi Alex,
Strange to see that there are 5 candidates who are potentially running in the March 3rd primary election in our congressional district, but only one is taking the time to meet with our neighbors. Really? Some just like to put their name in the hat as if it is a lucky draw?
Here is another question. Do you recall when an elected congressmember of our district held 3 face to face town hall meetings a month? In the past 9 months, Rishi has met with neighbors in each of the 31 cities of our congressional district and has held 3 town hall meetings every month - one in each county. He also holds a weekly ""Rush Hour with Rishi"" video call.
America needs the right kind of leadership. Rishi has a people-centric agenda and will independently make [[URL REDACTED]] at the behest of lobbyists. Rishi has! Rishi has met with neighbors in each of the district cities of San Mateo County to get a keen sense of the issues facing every city and every neighborhood.
What differentiates Rishi from Congresswoman Anna Eshoo:
Rishi has taken the pledge to not accept any special interest, PAC, or lobbyist dollar - his allegiance is with the people, not those trying to buy our elections. Congresswoman Eshoo is the #1 career recipient of campaign contributions from Big Pharma in the U.S. House of Representatives. [[URL REDACTED]]
Will elected leaders who accept all this money be able to truly represent the people?
THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT TRUST - WHO CAN YOU TRUST?
Read this [[URL REDACTED]] quote: “Anna Eshoo’s record on drug prices is terrible, and the reason why is obvious,” David Mitchell, founder of Patients For Affordable Drugs. “She’s taken enormous sums of money from drug corporations, and she does their bidding in Washington.”
""[[URL REDACTED]] Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Cal.) — the chair of the Energy and Commerce panel’s health subcommittee — have each continued to accept contributions from PACs affiliated with companies including Pfizer, Amgen, and Novartis throughout 2019""
""Patients for Affordable Drugs Now last year even sank $500,000 into ads attacking Eshoo for receiving drug industry money. ""
""Democratic lawmakers’ continued willingness to accept pharmaceutical industry campaign contributions also comes despite a climate in which voters have come to dislike the pharmaceutical industry more than any other, according to a recent Gallup poll.""
ENDS QUOTE
RISHI HAS A PEOPLE-CENTRIC AGENDA
To get a view on how Rishi put the people of our district first, please watch the video below
Too often our politicians recite planned talking points and rehearsed speeches, without giving any real substance to their plans to better the quality of life of those they are seeking to serve. That’s why Rishi has been running a different kind of campaign — one that puts the residents of our district first and the critical issues our families face on a daily basis. Rishi is committed to listening.
RISHI'S ACTIVISM: As a Saratoga City Councilmember, Rishi took on an investor owned water utility company and helped reject, reduce and suspend seven of their rate increase proposals that would have adversely impacted a million residents of Silicon Valley. Here is a video of Rishi's speech at a CPUC public hearing (11/17).
RISHI DROPPED BURGLARIES: Rishi also focused upon neighborhood crime which has become a significant source of concern in every Silicon Valley city. Click on this link to download a safety tips sheet specifically geared for your city. As Saratoga's councilmember, Rishi stemmed the tide on increasing burglaries. Watch this video to learn how Saratoga crime dropped by almost 50%
RISHI SEEKS TO EARN YOUR TRUST
We hope we can earn your trust and your vote for the March 3rd primary election.
Choose the candidate that will truly represent the people.
Please do not hesitate to call or set up a time to talk about the race and the issues impacting you!

224,"We invested our scarce campaign resources to help our neighbors with pandemic. With the spike, we continue...
Hi Alex,
I’ve never believed in sitting on my hands. That’s for the career politicians, who have been too comfortable with the old way of doing business for decades.
These past few months, I’ve been telling my team what I’ve believed my entire life: when we’re in crisis, we help! That’s why back in March, our team stopped our campaign and launched the Neighborhood Pandemic Preparedness Team (NPPT) to help the most vulnerable in our community. We invested our scarce campaign resources to help our neighbors. And the results speak for themselves:
* We dropped thousands of flyers outside the homes of our neighbors expressing our desire to help.
* We called all 86,000 seniors in the district, delivering groceries, medications, and even their favorite coffee! We helped them stay sheltered-in-place.
* Organized over 23 town halls with local health experts, stimulus package experts, small business experts, college admissions counselors, and community activists
* Sewed a few thousand masks, all of which were donated to the Valley Medical Foundation; including PPEs that were donated to us that included N-95 masks
* Created a comprehensive list of resources for those struggling in the COVID-19 economy, from career advice for the unemployed to loan application information for small businesses. Visit [[URL REDACTED]] NOTE: You can join our NPPT team and help neighbors by submitting your info at this page - just scroll down all the way to the bottom.
* Offered shelter-in-place coding classes (currently in session) — sign-up at [[URL REDACTED]]
And as the Silicon Valley faces a new spike in COVID-19 cases, I’m writing this message to let you know that my team of hundreds of volunteers stands ready to help in whatever ways we can. Whether you need someone to pick up your groceries and prescriptions, or are looking for resources to help you navigate these difficult times, my experienced team is eager to continue their quest of helping folks in our community. To that end, my campaign is taking the next few weeks to leave flyers outside people’s homes letting them know we're here to help. Rest assured all of our volunteers are well-trained in complying with CDC guidelines, with masks, social distancing and the whole enchilada. We have all stayed safe for months while helping thousands of Silicon Valley neighbors; yes, we understand the challenges of the Covid-19 world.
I’ll end with this thought: Please don't hesitate to reach out to us, no matter who you support this November. Because just like I learned when I launched many neighborhood watch programs that nearly halved Saratoga’s crime five years ago, neighbors always help neighbors. We can move mountains together…like not allowing 7 San Jose Water rate proposals to move forward.
I will always be with you.
My commitment to serve all people is steadfast - Republicans and Democrats, every possible demographic and every strata of our society.
I will specifically focus on folks who don’t have a voice. For sure! No questions asked!

Warm Regards,
🇺🇸 Rishi Kumar 🇺🇸

Berkeley, San Jose State University, Santa Clara University, and high schools such as Bellarmine, Palo Alto, Gunn, Lynbrook, Monte Vista, Saratoga, Harker etc.
Rishi won his re-election with the most votes in Saratoga’s 60 year election history. Rishi rejects PAC money and Special Interest Group money. Rishi’s intern team is currently doing the following pandemic activities: helping neighbors with their groceries, medication pick-ups, making masks, running informational podcasts and town hall meetings, along with a coronavirus newsletter.
Joining the Fellowship Program would allow you to:
\- Get a personal letter of recommendation at the end of the program upon request
\- Get volunteer hours
\- Earn valuable political and leadership experience while working alongside dozens of your peers
\- The chance to win MVP awards and get recognized for your achievements at the weekly fellowship meeting as well as campaign gatherings.
\- Have the chance to run for the California Democratic Party Executive Board or for a DNC Delegate position during the California Primaries
\- Have the chance to earn passes to the California Democratic State Convention. Many of our interns have attended prior conventions and shook hands with Presidential candidates.
Apply today and discover a summer of empowerment, friendship and learning

Hi Alex,
Please join this discussion about racism, inequality and crime.
Today @ 4pm
RSVP at [[URL REDACTED]]
""You can't walk while black. You can't jog while black. You can’t drive while black. And... you can’t sleep while you are black”
America has had enough. It is time we all stood together and said, “No more.”
How can we have an America that believes in justice for all when we have such blatant prejudice?
No more precious American lives tragically murdered and lost every year.
No more children separated from their fathers ….forever.
It is time we changed [[URL REDACTED]] and forever
Let us find answers together.
Please join me today for an important discussion on how each and every one of us can make a real difference in changing the systemic racism that has fomented in our society since the first slaves were brought here four hundred years ago.
Ahmaud Arbery was gunned down while on a jog in Georgia. Breonna Taylor was shot by Louisville police while asleep in her own bed. Tony McDade was asked to not move, he didn’t move, and he was still shot. And we all know what happened to George Floyd.
Racial injustice, the systemic issues and disparities that exist in our society that also cause inequality must be addressed now and with a real sense of urgency. What is happening around us is not just civil unrest but an expression of grief and anger over the needless deaths over hundreds of years. The violence has to stop but we have to express our grief and find answers out of this mess America is in.
Our elected leaders have failed us for decades now, in their inability to put an end to this. We need to be leading the charge and demanding massive institutional reforms of police departments.
If we don’t do something now, none of us will escape prejudice and our communities will continue to pay the price and bear the consequences. We have to purge this plague of violence from the world. Police brutality of American citizens is unacceptable and must not be tolerated by politicians who, year after year, turn a blind eye.
The time to unlearn hatred is now and the cultural shift from prejudice to love. This is overdue and we should stop breathing till we do that.
The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “A riot is the language of the unheard.” Violence must never be condoned, but leaders must listen to the voices of the people.
We need new leadership, and we need to take action NOW.
Here is a compilation of anti-racism resources and organizations you can donate.
Please review and act.
“No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.”

227,"Out of touch elected leaders are in vogue. But Rishi has been fighting San Jose Water Company for years - a private investor owned utility company
Hi Alex,
How do you display your support for an upstart challenger? How about a red, white and blue lawn sign? I got a simple question from someone based on our lawn signs that are slowly appearing all over the Congressional District. ""Should I contribute to your campaign to get the lawn sign?"" Oh no, not at all. Just make your request at [[URL REDACTED]] and we will drop it [[URL REDACTED]] soon as this weekend.
Out of touch elected leaders are in vogue: Rep. Anna Eshoo recently delivered a speech on August 26, 2020. Elected leaders being out of touch is a myth or a reality? You need to watch the excerpted 2 minute speech. From Rep. Eshoo's speech, “’…there were orange jumpsuits. And those were the individuals from the California Department of Corrections. They too have been trained in firefighting. they work the fires. …I didn’t know that…” Tell me, who does not know that?
Rep. Eshoo is blissfully ignorant that having inmates on the fire lines is a paramount social justice issue and changes need to be made. As per Rep. Eshoo, “I salute them for doing their fair share.” For Rep. Eshoo to not be aware of the issue, never mind their involvement, is inexcusable. For the complete writeup, click on this blog link.
As we enter the final push to win this race, I need your support:
Please donate: Our fundraising was impacted by Covid-19. But we are pushing! Help us fight the tainted money in politics by making a small contribution at [[URL REDACTED]] We only accept money from people, not PACs or Special Interest Groups - unlike Rep. Eshoo who gets at least 50% of her campaign money from PACs [[URL REDACTED]] #1 in the country from Big Pharma. Would you please help the upstart?

Rishi is not beholden to special interests; he is a results driven, hardworking advocate for his constituents. You can be assured that he will fight for us, and when there are tough challenges, Rishi will tackle them with the tenacity and integrity to succeed in Washington.

229,"Rep. Eshoo is in her 28th year, but has only passed 4 bills into law. Two bills renamed a post office and federal building. Another redesignated a month as National Scleroderma Awareness Month and the 4th modified provisions to determine payments at children’s hospital. Ineffective legislations.
Hi Alex,
Rep. Eshoo only has 4 trivial bills in 28 years ?
I did not believe it when it was brought to my attention. I called a Washington Congressional Representative. This is what I was told, “No way Rep. Eshoo has 49 Bills. Clear standard in Congress is bills in your name. Cosponsorship does not matter.” [[URL REDACTED]] is the single source of truth. Do not trust anything else. Click on the link above – see for yourself.
But let us talk about my track record: Why did someone like me win with the most votes in Saratoga’s election history - beating the Mayor quite easily on Election night 2018. Let me say this, I barely scraped through with 71 votes in 2014 during my first run to the Saratoga City Council. For the re-election, I was endorsed by hundreds including congressional representatives, senators, assembly members, county supervisors, mayors, vice mayors, councilmembers and hundreds of neighborhood leaders. But the establishment of Saratoga always felt undermined and chose not to endorse my run. I am grassroots-driven and people-powered - the reason we won: I took on the toughest challenges that no one on my city council wanted to. That is what activists do. The 2018 win was historical! It told me clearly that if you do the right thing for the people, you won’t need to worry about the kitchen sink thrown at you. I challenged the system and some of my city council colleagues were not happy. Just read the Mountain Winery project from earlier this year.
As a Silicon Valley elected leader, with my tech roots defining my “getting things done” approach, I have aspired to operate at a high level of excellence as an elected leader. I treated my elected leadership role very seriously. Thousands of people had trusted me with their vote, and I couldn’t let them down. Silicon Valley has never been about activity for the sake of activity, but about results - in every domain. That is my DNA.
Why am I in politics? To solve problems! I will always fight on behalf of the people and seek to establish trust directly with the people.
But politicians today are gaming the system – sometimes for 28 years.
Three parts to this 28-yearlong saga:
Part 1: Asleep on the Wheel
28 years and 4 pieces of legislation that became law: a colossal failure. Two of Rep. Eshoo’s bills renamed a post office and federal building. Another designated a month as National Scleroderma Awareness Month. The fourth modified provisions to determine payments at children’s hospitals.
Well, you need a majority to pass a law: There were at least two occasions where the Democrats had a majority in the House and Senate with a sitting Democratic President. Rep. Eshoo could have passed any law she wanted. Simply put, Rep. Eshoo could have done a lot more. She made 100 attempts at legislations in her first 27 years (without the threat of a competitive run). Whereas Rep. Ro Khanna has already made 50 attempts at legislations in his first 4 years. No matter how you look at it, Rep. Eshoo is a failure. Rep. Eshoo is being deceptive when she claims 49 bills with no hyperlinks to back that claim. Remember, links have to go to [[URL REDACTED]]
Cosponsorship of bills should have some value: Rep. Eshoo’s record is mediocre no matter how you slice and dice it. Rishi called it out: most of Rep. Eshoo’s work is a “tag along” and co-sponsorship. No, she has not exactly been the chief innovator by introducing bills that passed and became law. For example - Rep. Eshoo claimed cosponsorship of the Green New Deal at the debate. Senator Markey is the original sponsor and gets the majority of the credit. I pointed out that there were 101 cosponsors of the Green New Deal. Notably, Senator Markey has introduced game changing legislations - since his days in the House.
But this is exactly what Silicon Valley residents have been talking about – lack of accomplishments. Her weekly updates or candidate statements have been about, “I voted for this, I sent this letter, I plan to do this” but the accomplishments and results have been missing for 28 years.
Failures galore: Failure with the Pandemic, with California Fires, with Traffic, with Housing, with Homelessness, with Big Tech. For example, under Rep. Eshoo’s watch, Facebook - located in our congressional district - was investigated for misusing user data. Later at the congressional hearing, you can watch Rep. Eshoo proudly ask the questions reading from sheets of paper written by an aide. But it was her failure to legislate that led to this. Blindsided for sure. Out of touch?
Part Deux: Harming the American people
But the story of her failures gets sordid. Not addressing the people challenges, but actually harming the people’s interests.
#1 Rep. Eshoo worked 15 years on a pandemic plan, but failed to codify it. As the chair of the House Health Subcommittee - the onus was upon her for sure. As the co-chair of the Biodefense Caucus, Rep. Eshoo did not hold a single meeting, even though putting a pandemic plan was part of the mission. I highly recommend you click on this link and read her endorsements – sitting upon a shaky foundation. Just a bad political nexus – why should failures be appreciated? You will find the Citizens United endorsement appalling.
#2 IN 2009, she introduced legislation that favors Pharma \- as the chair of the House Health Subcommittee - did not favor people, giving pharmaceutical companies 12-year exclusivity periods for biologic drugs, beyond the length of their patents, to protect them from competition by the generic drug industry. For this, she received multiple awards from the industry. Don’t forget, she is the #1 recipient of Pharma money in the United States House of Representatives. After the Stanford Daily shared their concern for Rep. Eshoo’s ties to Big Pharma, Rep. Eshoo herself ADMITTED and justified it. We don’t buy the justification. Rep. Eshoo did nothing against Big Pharma greed; 700,000 opioid deaths over the last 20 years.
#3 California Fires: Watch the video of Rep. Eshoo at a CalFire hearing. She confessed that she had no idea California uses inmates for fire-fighting. Here are a few people quotes who were watching:
I was appalled at her ""visit"" during this terrible time. She offered nothing but a campaign speech.
\- Robin Woodman
Ha! Pretty brilliant campaigning to pull this one out. I remember this press conference. We were wondering if our neighborhood was on fire yet and she didn't really know what to say other than lots of self-referencing. I already put my ballot in and voted for you.
\- Julie Kanagy
She is terrible. I'm surviving the CZU fire, and she's just using as a tool.
\- Liz Wolfe
This was super tone def. I remember being super pissed when she started speaking ‘cause I just wanted to know if my home was going to survive
\- Kirsten Tuck
It was obvious she has never been in this neck of her district and had no idea about the inmate fire fighters or any other information. She needed to be short and sweet and let the experts talk. Please be better than this Rishi... come hike in the redwoods and get to know those of us in the woods.
\- Renee Waggener
I don’t even think she knows where she is...
\- Nicolo Pastor
Anna Eshoo who. As you can tell She’s never cared or been a part of our community. She doesn’t have my vote. We need to clean house around here.
\- Nick Thompson
Part 3: Viewpoints from the people: More here
“I was done with Eshoo when she joined with ultra right wing Joe Barton of TX to block the quicker path towards drugs becoming generic. When was that? About ten years ago. I’ll be glad to vote for Rishi Kumar”
\- John Fox
I voted for you last week by absentee ballot, and my family the same. People aren't stupid, they can be fooled some of the time, and
your time has come. Wishing you victory, as it will be a victory for the People in this district. We cannot tolerate incompetence and
corruption any more. Not at the district level, the State, or the Country. Americans are fed up with sick, corrupt, incompetent crime
family syndicates that are robbing our wealth and future. We nearing a major sea change by the 'silent majority'. No one can stop us.
\- Danny
I would be honored to have your vote
My run seeks to bring ethical integrity into politics by NEVER accepting PAC money or Special Interest Group money. I bring a result-driven outcome to challenge the Washington status quo and divisive partisan politics.
America is ready for a new leadership.
It is time for change. I will serve with integrity, honor and energy. And I will be there for every resident of our district. That is a promise.
Question to ponder: What is the outcome of mediocrity in Silicon Valley?
The choice is ours.
Rep. Eshoo has not been a strong enough voice, and is even out of touch, on the important issues of today, and it’s time for change.
I would be honored to have your vote.
In solidarity,
Rishi Kumar

230,"This is Unacceptable
Carpenters Union Thugs Are Attacking Our Signs
Hello Alex,
The most unbelievable thing happened the other day. A union, specifically the Southwest Carpenter’s Union, destroyed multiple of my large, very costly, campaign signs, and then stuck signs up that said this:
Sadly, while I said this is unbelievable, it really isn’t. Unions control politicians like Susie Lee, so they need to try to make sure she gets elected. This is because they know they will not be able to control me!
There is a police investigation into this criminal activity by Susie Lee’s thugs, activity that my team caught them on camera admitting. I intend to prosecute.
(Below is the 7 minute video of the Southwest Carpenters Union members admitting to the crime and trying to intimidate my staff)
Carpenters Union Admits to Vandalism and Harasses Rodimer Staff
In the meantime, I ask that you help me get my signs back up, and quickly. There are still people who haven’t voted and I need to make sure I reach those people so that we can turn this state RED. Can you contribute $25 right now to help make sure Susie Lee’s thugs don’t get away with what they did? That way we can fire Susie Lee and finally bring ethics back to our great state, when I am elected.

231,"Susie Lee has been lying about our family.
You Deserve The Truth
Hello Alex,
When Dan decided to run for political office, it was a decision we made together, as a family. We have five children, with a sixth on the way. Together, we certainly knew that politics can and would get ugly. But, nothing could prepare our family for the outright lies and disgusting attacks that have been launched against us by Susie Lee.
My husband was arrested one time in his life, years ago while he was in college on a Halloween night, after shoving another adult male who had been bullying one of Dan’s friends. That’s it. One arrest. And the charges from that one arrest were dismissed. In fact, to this very day, Dan Rodimer has no criminal record.
As for Susie Lee using 911 calls, the government documents Susie refers to in her smears clearly state nothing more than a verbal argument occurred and no crime was committed. Yet she continues to smear us with lies, knowing full well they aren’t true. Susie Lee thinks it’s okay to spend millions of dollars exploiting my family for her political gain. It’s shameful and it disgusts me.
In fact, the largest coalition of Nevada law enforcement have endorsed my husband in this race. Its the largest in the state. Not only that, they stripped Susie of this endorsement and gave it to Dan. … something they wouldn’t do if they believed he was at all dangerous or had any kind of criminal record.
Susie Lee has done nothing for the people she represents. She has failed the people of Nevada in CD3. Instead, she’s used her taxpayer-funded position to enrich herself and her family while in office. She’s spending millions of dollars smearing Dan instead of running ads about her own record, because her record is terrible.
Dan Rodimer is a wonderful man. To his friends, or anyone that meets him, he’s truly one of the kindest. He’s a loving and compassionate husband. And, he is a great Dad and role model to our children.
As the mother of our kids, and as Dan’s wife, we will fight through it.
Yes, “Big Dan” is a former WWE professional wrestler, but he isn’t the only one who is tough in our family. We will continue to love one another, and we will leave our trust in you the voters, to see through these disgusting lies against our husband, dad and friend.
Thank you for taking a few moments of your day to read this.

Alex,
Despite nasty attacks from the far left Democrats, I will always protect American families from the crimes, drugs, and illegal aliens that flood across our southern border.
I’m fulfilling my promise to BUILD THE WALL because American families deserve to be protected. However -- if they're elected, the Washington Democrats would harm American families by locking down our economy and opening up our borders. Tiffany Shedd will join me in building the wall, reopening our economy, and fighting for YOU.
Will you join me in fighting to send Tiffany to Washington? She’s under attack by the far left, and she’s become a top target of liberal groups, who will fight tooth and nail to keep her out of Washington. Tiffany needs your URGENT support RIGHT NOW!

Nothing is more important than keeping our American families safe from the drugs, criminals and violence that used to flood over our southern border.

**Breaking News: The Senate Acquits President Trump***
Alex,
It happened. After the Democrats wasted months of our time and taxpayer dollars investigating President Trump, we found out that President Trump did not commit ANY crimes.
This entire stunt was just a political scheme started by Nancy Pelosi and her liberal supporters, like Tom O'Halleran, who tried to overturn the 2016, election by impeachment.
Alex, now that Trump has been cleared, he needs real support in Congress. That’s why we’re launching a 24-Hour Impeachment Defeated Fund.
Help us celebrate this HISTORIC victory by making sure Trump gets the support he needs!
Rush in $25 and help us send Tiffany to Congress to fight for President Trump’s winning agenda>>>
Hurry this fund ends in 24 hours!
Rush in 20.20 >>>
Rush in $50 >>>

Tiffany will ""never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the"" people in Arizona.

Alex,
The Democrats in Congress are out of control. One-fifth of the House Democratic caucus has co-sponsored a new bill called The New Way Forward. This bill transforms our immigration system to ensure that criminals are allowed to move to the United States and become citizens.
The New Way Forward bill would:
* Make it nearly impossible for ICE to detain immigrants
* Make it illegal to automatically deport criminals regardless of crime
* Allow people who commit serious felonies in other countries to still come to the United States
* Decriminalize illegal entry into the US.
This bill abolishes our borders and allows anyone to freely enter our country without any consequences.
If enacted The New Way Forward bill would be disastrous.
Alex, Tiffany grew up, raised her family, and owns a farm near the southern border so she understands the real issues that affect our border. She supports building the wall and increasing our border security measures.
If enacted The New Way Forward bill would be disastrous. It prioritizes criminals ahead of the safety and security of American families.
Stand with Tiffany against this new threat to our national security by signing our Stop The New Way Forward Petition.
Add your name to stand with Tiffany and say no to opening our borders>>>
One thing is clear – this bill makes it easier to arrest you, as an American citizen than arresting an illegal immigrant.
Stand with Tiffany ➝ fight back
It’s alarming how so many Democrats want to reshape our immigration system and put our communities at risk. We need Tiffany in Congress to stand against this and to fight with President Trump.
Thank you,
Team Shedd

Dear Patriot
It's Aliscia Andrews here, and as you know, I'm a U. S. Marine, National security expert who has worked keeping our nation safe at the border, and a mom who has seen the Left destroy this country one piece at a time.
This is a district that has been Republican for 60 out of the last 66 years and can be flipped with your support!
I’m done letting it happen. I’m fighting back with everything I have.
I’ve spent a career keeping this nation safe. Now, the Left is trying to undo all of our security by abolishing the police, abolishing law and order, and keeping our economy shackled in lockdown.
Can I count on you to join our stand against Socialism? Donate $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, or any other amount today and you can help us stop the Socialist Left from taking over!
DONATE TODAY!
There are only 28 Days left!
We have a choice—we can either choose President Trump, the side that’s beating the coronavirus or the Socialist Radical Left that wants to topple all public safety in the middle of a crime wave and a pandemic.
I’m standing with our President!
He beat the coronavirus and just left the hospital! But, not before thanking the tens of thousands of Trump supporters for coming to pray for him!
The Left lost their minds when he did this. They beat their keyboards screaming about how he isn’t really sick, endangered people, and other nonsense accusations!
If President Obama had done the exact same thing after getting sick, they would be fawning over him for his bravery.
The Fake News media is blinded by fanatical leftist hatred against our President. No President has been more mistreated by the Fake News media!
Let’s send them a strong message— let’s retire Socialist Wexton who wrongly tweeted that our President is a white supremacist!
That’s just sick!
Please donate your most generous gift today and we can stop the Socialist Left here and now! We only have 28 days and we need to keep up with Bloomberg’s spending here in the 10th!
God Bless,

Dear Patriot,
It’s Aliscia Andrews. As you know, I am running to retake Virginia’s 10th District from Socialist Jennifer Wexton and her billionaire swamp backers, like Mike Bloomberg!
I’m a US Marine, a Specialist in National Security working to secure our border, an unapologetic conservative, a strong supporter of President Trump, and 100% pro-life!
The Socialist Left have lost its mind.
Radical BLM extremists and Antifa terrorists are driving us towards abolishing every police department in America!
Socialist Jennifer Wexton is standing with their radical, anti-police agenda! So far, she has REFUSED to condemn the horrible violence against our cops!
As they chant “abolish the police,” the Leftist mob has attacked police left and right around the nation!
Socialist Jennifer Wexton is an absolute embarrassment!
Will you help me get rid of her?
Please donate today and help me fight back against Socialist Wexton and the Leftist mob’s effort to Defund/Abolish the police!
*FIGHT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT!*
In Prince William County, near where I live, a Defund/Abolish the Police protest was held outside the county building!
I was at an event there when these protestors showed up and began blocking the county government building entrance, screaming obscenities and antagonizing the police officers just doing their jobs!
After a counter protestor tried to enter the building, the crowd of BLM radicals surrounded and attacked the man!
Police arrested four radicals who assaulted the man as he tried to enter the building. All four were charged with assault and battery.
This is just sick! I had the misfortune of watching these radicals plot their attack and descend on this counter protestor for the crime of walking into a government building!
These radical BLM extremists are trying to destroy this country—one riot at a time!
How many more innocent Americans need to be attacked by the Leftist mob before Socialist Wexton even bats an eye?
She doesn’t care about us. And it’s time for a change in leadership!
It’s time for a #WEXIT!
Will you help me fight back?
Please donate $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, $1,000, or more to my campaign and send a strong conservative to Washington who will stand up against the Leftist mob!
Thank you for your support and prayers!

Dear Patriot,
My name is Aliscia Andrews. I’m a conservative, a Trump supporter, a US Marine, and now serve in Homeland Security keeping our country safe from threats both foreign and domestic. I am running to take back Virginia’s 10th District from Socialist Jennifer Wexton!
Virginia is under attack as Leftist socialists are assaulting our freedoms at every turn… And Jennifer Wexton is on the front lines leading the charge!
She voted for the impeachment charade, has been at Pelosi’s every beck and call, and has backed Socialist bills like Medicare for All!
Simply put, we have to stop her! Please donate today to my campaign and together, we can take back the 10th!
I know what it's like to serve and give the ultimate sacrifice. One of my closest friends in high school died serving this country. He sacrificed everything. And it inspired me to put it all on the line as well.
I joined the US Marines. As a Marine, I have been deployed to the Middle East, Africa, and everything in between. I have seen the suffering that tyranny and socialist policies bring.
And it’s exactly why I got off the sidelines and decided to run for Congress. The Swamp and Washington insider politicians have had their way long enough!
At every turn, they fight our President. The Deep State and their allies in Congress have plotted to take down the President since Day one.
This impeachment charade was pathetic. I was appalled and embarrassed for my district when I watched Wexton help lead the charge to impeach the President on bogus charges!
We need someone that will stand with the President and stand with his agenda! The President needs fighters in Washington!
We need real leadership in Washington! Please donate $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, or more to my campaign today!
As a homeland security official, I understand the threats facing our nation. I fight them every day I go to the office. The border is one of the greatest threats facing this nation.
Our Southern border is being invaded by illegal aliens skipping the line. Many take advantage of our porous borders and bring drugs, crime, and even terrorism into our nation.
Simply put, we MUST build the wall! I would stand with our President and fight against illegal immigration and secure our southern border!

Dear Patriot,
My name is Aliscia Andrews, the Republican nominee for Virginia’s 10th district—one of the biggest opportunities to flip a seat back to red this election year.
We have 42 Days Left!
The very future of our country could be decided in less than 50 days! It’s now or never!
We have watched a snapshot of what Biden’s America looks like for the last four months—
* Democrat-enforced lockdowns on business, churches, and funerals—but abortion clinics and riots are totally safe
* Absolute anarchy and chaos in every major city for the last four months—with more than TWO BILLION in property damage, thousands wounded, and dozens killed by Leftist mobs!
* Sky-high crime rates in every city but Democrats ramming through defund/abolish the police!
* Mobs attacking Republicans left and right—including one Trump supporter shot to death in Portland
* Democrats blocking coronavirus relief and turning around and blaming Republicans!
* Police officers being hunted down as the Left convince America they are all racist murderers…
This should terrify you.
And unless we take back Congress AND the White House, that’s our future.
Socialist Wexton is a vile Socialist voting with the squad 94% of the time—she’s another Leftist stooge siding with attacks against our police!
That is why I am fighting back! But I can’t do it alone…
We have a massive fundraising deadline fast approaching and the swamp and Socialist billionaire Bloomberg are pouring in MILLIONS to buy this district!
Can you chip in $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, $1,000, or more to STOP this Socialist anarchy in our streets and take back our Congress?

As we face a wave of crime, violence, and anarchy targeting cops, Democrats decided to INTENTIONALLY make them easier targets.
The Virginia State Senate, controlled by cop-hating Democrats, passed a bill that would make assaulting an officer a misdemeanor and drops the mandatory minimum of six months for assaulting an officer.

I need your help to meet my fundraising end of the month goal of $50,000 dollars! We need this money to compete against Wexton’s absentee ballot push!
We are running out of time!
Will you help us reach our goal with a donation of $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, $1,000, or more today?

The Socialist Left have led a never-ending, unceasing attack on our criminal justice system! In our General Assembly, the Democrats have pushed forward some heinous legislation that is going to ENCOURAGE crime!
They have advanced legislation that will:
* End “no-knock” warrants, which will result in police deaths when warrants are served to arrest armed and dangerous individuals
* Lessen criminal penalties for violent crimes like rape, murder, and domestic assault
* Encourage violently attacking police by lessening assault of an officer to a misdemeanor
* Allow cops to be easily fired for doing their jobs
And that’s just the tip of the iceberg…
Leftist Northam and the Socialist Left in charge of Virginia are going to make this state a criminal paradise in no time!
Socialist Wexton is trying to do the same with “Justice in Policing Act” which is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to gut law enforcement!

Dear Patriot,
Our Country is at a crossroads right now…
As the Coronavirus spreads from country to country and has even spread in pockets to our shores, we are reminded of how vitally important our borders are… and how insecure they are currently.
Our nation is being invaded by illegal aliens, pouring across our unsecure Southern border. Thousands of drug smugglers and human traffickers hide amongst them, bringing in violent crime.
In the wake of a pandemic, we need action NOW!
Please donate to my campaign and send a true conservative to Washington who will stand with the President and Build the Wall!
As a Homeland Security Policy Strategist, my job is to help keep our country safe. Every day, I have to deal with the consequences of an unsecure border, from a coronavirus outbreak to a gang shooting in our neighborhoods.
Waves of people pouring across our border in caravans, unvetted and illegally, is a huge national security risk! And Democrats like Jennifer Wexton will not do anything. In fact, they WANT open borders. Socialists like George Soros are even funding some of the caravans.
Why? Because they hope one day to grant illegal aliens total amnesty and create a new wave of democrat voters. And they don’t care how many Americans get hurt in the process.
These open-borders, pro-illegal Democrats like Wexton even go as far as to attack our existing border security infrastructure. Democrats have even said they want to abolish ICE! I need your help to stop them!
Its time to stand with the President, Build the Wall, and secure our Southern Border once and for all!
Please donate $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, or more to my campaign today and help me fight with the President!
The Illegal-First agenda needs to be stopped now! Our Country is so vulnerable to global pandemics like Coronavirus and smuggling without a secure border.
The Wall is just the start…
If elected, I will get border security and ICE the tools it needs to verify very single person who tries to step foot on American soil.
Socialist, illegal-first Democrats like Jennifer Wexton need to be sent packing and replaced by Conservatives who will stand with our President!
Please donate your most generous gift today and we can take back this District!
Thank you and God Bless,

Dear Patriot,
It’s Aliscia Andrews again. I’m a US Marine, National Security expert, and the Republican nominee of Virginia’s 10th district.
We have 21 DAYS LEFT!
Right now, the Socialist Left are funneling millions into this district to try and stop me! The last thing they want is a true conservative and US Marine stopping them at every turn in Congress!
They’re desperate to stop me—I need your help to overcome the sheer amount of money Socialist Wexton is spending!
Please donate $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, $1,000, or more to send a conservative fighter to Washington to fight back against Socialism!
DONATE TODAY!
I want you to take a look at this picture quote from an MSNBC anchor:
That’s what the Socialist Left thinks.
“Terrorist Trump must be defeated… Amy Coney Barrett must be convicted and removed from office and society.”
The Fake News media thinks it should be a crime to be conservative!
This kind of sick propaganda is being run by the DNC/the Fake News media to stop President Trump from winning!
Leftist hatred is on full display…
That’s why it’s so important we beat the Socialist Left at every level this election! We cannot let them have one bit of power! If they do, they’ll tear this country apart!
We have 21 Days left to stop them!
This kind of extremism needs to be stopped! We CANNOT let the Left have control of Congress again! If they do, they’ll impeach the President again and run more witch hunts against him!
Can you help me stop Socialist Wexton with a donation of $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, or any other amount today?
We can do this—but we need YOUR help! Please chip in and together, we will win!

Alex --
The U.S. Postal Service will be gone THIS FALL without immediate help.
This would END Vote-By-Mail and spell DISASTER for the entire 2020 Election!
Congress needs to act NOW: Sign the petition to demand Congress FULLY FUND the Post Office and PROTECT Vote‑By‑Mail >>
Business Insider explains it best: (we’ve included the most important parts)
Business Insider: Trump reportedly rejected approving a bailout package that would rescue the US Postal Service, and it could be a disaster for states trying to expand voting by mail
The United States has plunged the US Postal Service into dire financial straits, as more Americans than ever rely on post offices to deliver necessary medicine and supplies, especially in underserved rural areas.
House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Gerry Conolly, who runs the subcommittee that oversees the Postal Service, sounded the alarm that the agency could run out of funding altogether by September if Congress doesn't act soon.
""Based on a number of briefings and warnings this week about a critical fall-off in mail across the country, it has become clear that the Postal Service will not survive the fall without immediate help from Congress and the White House,"" the two said in a joint statement, calling on Congress to appropriate $25 million in emergency funds to the agency.
REPLY REQUIRED:
TELL CONGRESS TO SAVE THE POST OFFICE

As states have steadily expanded absentee and mail-in voting over the past two decades, the proportion of Americans voting in-person on election day has declined from 90% in 1992 to 60% in 2016, according to the US Census Bureau.
But some Republicans have openly protested expanding Vote-By-Mail options because they believe it would hurt them politically. Trump said in a recent ""Fox & Friends"" appearance that the House's stimulus provisions had ""levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.""
Since then, Trump has continued to spread misinformation about the safety and security of voting by mail on his Twitter account, falsely claiming that it ""substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD,"" which none of the available evidence on Vote-By-Mail supports.
REPLY REQUIRED:
TELL CONGRESS TO SAVE THE POST OFFICE

The U.S. Postal Service is a critical and beloved institution.
And their role in delivering millions of mail-in ballots this November will prove to be critical to the 2020 Election.
But Republicans are terrified by the prospect of increased voter turnout ‑‑ so they’re determined to run the U.S. Post Office into the ground!
We CANNOT let that happen.

Alex -- I’m asking you for $5 to help me defeat Devin Nunes (Trump’s FAVORITE Congressman). Here’s why:
* Polls are SO CLOSE. And Devin barely won re-election in 2018.
* Trump is scared to death of our campaign. He knows we can really win.
* Republicans are FLOODING Devin Nunes with cash to crush our campaign!
In all honesty, their Republican mega-bucks could sink us. I won’t have the resources to compete without your help.
Can you split $5 between my campaign and the Progressive Turnout Project today? It will go directly toward defeating Devin Nunes and we’ll strike a HUGE blow against Trump in November →

Alex, Devin Nunes is “Trump’s favorite Republican”.
He spreads deadly COVID conspiracy theories on Fox News. Spews lies about Vote-by-Mail. And always covers up Trump’s crimes and corruption!
Republicans LOVE it --- that’s why he has so much campaign cash.
But I know that we can take this seat back with your help.

Business Insider explains it best: (we’ve included the most important parts)
Business Insider: Trump Reportedly Rejected Approving a Bailout Package that would Rescue the US Postal Service, and It Could Be a Disaster for States Trying to Expand Voting by Mail
The United States has plunged the US Postal Service into dire financial straits, as more Americans than ever rely on post offices to deliver necessary medicine and supplies, especially in underserved rural areas.
House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Gerry Conolly, who runs the subcommittee that oversees the Postal Service, sounded the alarm that the agency could run out of funding altogether by June if Congress doesn’t act soon.
'Based on a number of briefings and warnings this week about a critical fall-off in mail across the country, it has become clear that the Postal Service will not survive the summer without immediate help from Congress and the White House,' the two said in a March 23 joint statement, calling on Congress to appropriate $25 million in emergency funds to the agency.

As states have steadily expanded absentee and mail-in voting over the past two decades, the proportion of Americans voting in-person on election day has declined from 90% in 1992 to 60% in 2016, according to the US Census Bureau.
But some Republicans have openly protested expanding vote by mail options because they believe it would hurt them politically.  Trump said in a recent 'Fox & Friends' appearance that the House's stimulus provisions had 'levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.'
Since then, Trump has continued to spread misinformation about the safety and security of voting by mail on his Twitter account, falsely claiming that it 'substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD,' which none of the available evidence on vote by mail supports.

JUSTICE FOR JACOB BLAKE: DEMAND THE POLICE CHIEF AND SHERIFF RESIGN IMMEDIATELY >>
Alex -- Justice must be served.
Jacob Blake was shot 7 times in the back while getting into his car. He was shot in front of his three small children. He spent the following days in the hospital fighting for his life.
“Dismantling systemic racism in our nation starts with demanding justice & holding offenders accountable.”
\-- Kamala Harris
Jacob Blake is innocent. But his innocence couldn’t protect him from the horrors of police brutality. Just like it couldn’t protect George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and countless more.
What makes this all even worse is that Kenosha cops were seen cozying up to white supremacists in the ensuing protests. Their racism runs deep.
We know that as long as Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis and Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth remain in their positions, there will NEVER be justice for David Blake.
So we’re calling for their immediate resignation in protest of racist police brutality.
We won’t rest until these offenders are held accountable for their crime. Sign on to demand the police chief and sheriff in Kenosha RESIGN →

Alex, Donald Trump has been abusing his position since the first day he became president.
He’s used his power and influence to end criminal investigations and avoid conviction.
And Alex, enough is enough. Trump needs to be held accountable for his crimes.
But Congress will only charge Trump if it’s what the American people want.
That’s why we’re issuing an urgent public opinion poll today to gauge what our top supporters think. And Alex, we really need to hear from you:

Getting Democrats to the polls is the most effective way to win elections -- and increasing Democratic Voter Turnout is the only way to defeat Donald Trump.

That’s why we need your help! Passing Medicare for All, saving Social Security, and making Trump a one term President will take a MASSIVE increase in Democratic Voter Turnout.

Alex --
The U.S. Postal Service will be gone THIS SUMMER without immediate help.
This would END vote-by-mail and spell DISASTER for the entire 2020 Election!
Congress needs to act NOW: Sign the petition to demand Congress FULLY FUND the Post Office and PROTECT vote‑by‑mail >>
Business Insider explains it best: (we’ve included the most important parts)
Business Insider: Trump Reportedly Rejected Approving a Bailout Package that would Rescue the US Postal Service, and It Could Be a Disaster for States Trying to Expand Voting by Mail
The United States has plunged the US Postal Service into dire financial straits, as more Americans than ever rely on post offices to deliver necessary medicine and supplies, especially in underserved rural areas.
House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Gerry Conolly, who runs the subcommittee that oversees the Postal Service, sounded the alarm that the agency could run out of funding altogether by June if Congress doesn’t act soon.
'Based on a number of briefings and warnings this week about a critical fall-off in mail across the country, it has become clear that the Postal Service will not survive the summer without immediate help from Congress and the White House,' the two said in a March 23 joint statement, calling on Congress to appropriate $25 million in emergency funds to the agency.

As states have steadily expanded absentee and mail-in voting over the past two decades, the proportion of Americans voting in-person on election day has declined from 90% in 1992 to 60% in 2016, according to the US Census Bureau.
But some Republicans have openly protested expanding vote by mail options because they believe it would hurt them politically.  Trump said in a recent 'Fox & Friends' appearance that the House's stimulus provisions had 'levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.'
Since then, Trump has continued to spread misinformation about the safety and security of voting by mail on his Twitter account, falsely claiming that it 'substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD,' which none of the available evidence on vote by mail supports.

The U.S. Postal Service is a critical and beloved institution.
And their role in delivering millions of mail-in ballots this November will prove to be critical to the 2020 Election.
But Republicans are terrified by the prospect of increased voter turnout ‑‑ so they’re determined to run the U.S. Post Office into the ground!
We CANNOT let that happen.

Last night, two police officers shot Jacob Blake multiple times as he was getting into his car. They shot him in front of his three small children. Now, he’s fighting for his life.
This is unacceptable. Being Black in America shouldn’t be a death sentence. It was for George Floyd. It was for Breonna Taylor. And now Jacob Blake could be the latest victim at the hands of police violence.
Our thoughts and prayers are with Jacob Blake as he fights for his life, as well as with his family and three small children. We are working hard to demand justice for Jacob Blake.

Pandemic Escalates Domestic Abuse and Reduces Chances to Flee - NPR
With the nation trapped inside, domestic abuse is rising. And thanks to the “Boyfriend Loophole”, abusers can purchase guns LEGALLY!
That means victims of domestic violence are housebound with violent abusers who have legal access to dangerous weapons.
We must end this nightmare. Click to demand Congress close the “Boyfriend Loophole” >>
ADD MY NAME >>
If 25,000 activists sign this petition before 10 am, we can FORCE Congress to close this deadly loophole
Victims of domestic violence live in a constant state of fear.
But because of a horrible and dangerous policy called the “Boyfriend Loophole,” even if their abusers are convicted for their crimes, they can still legally purchase guns.
The NRA has been fighting tooth and nail to keep this policy on the books.
They don’t care who gets their hands on these deadly weapons as long as guns are selling and the NRA is happy.
So, I'm circulating this petition to CLOSE the Boyfriend Loophole and keep deadly weapons out of the wrong hands.
I'm asking for 25,000 activists to sign and send a strong message to Congress. Add your name today to close the Boyfriend Loophole >>
ADD MY NAME >>
Alex, closing the Boyfriend Loophole will save thousands of lives.
That’s because gun violence and domestic violence are intertwined. Just look at some of these devastating statistics:
\-- 1 in 3 women have been the victim of physical violence or stalking by an intimate partner.
\-- In 2016, 1 in 3 women murdered were killed by an intimate partner with a gun.
\-- About every 16 hours, a woman is shot and killed by a former or current partner.
This is appalling.
Closing the Boyfriend Loophole won’t end domestic violence. But it is a CRITICAL first step in keeping thousands of victims safe.
If 25,000 activists sign our petition, we could help close this loophole for good.
Alex, will you sign to close the Boyfriend Loophole right away?

If we collect 100,000 signatures DEMANDING an investigation → we can RUIN Trump and send him to JAIL where he BELONGS!
But that means we need your signature before midnight. Without your signature, Trump will go totally FREE. Can you SIGN NOW? We still need [7] signatures from 60521 to meet our goal! >>

Trump's actions are BLATANT violations of the Hatch Act, which forbids federal employees from using their power for political gain.

Business Insider explains it best: (we’ve included the most important parts)
Business Insider: Trump Reportedly Rejected Approving a Bailout Package that would Rescue the US Postal Service, and It Could Be a Disaster for States Trying to Expand Voting by Mail
The United States has plunged the US Postal Service into dire financial straits, as more Americans than ever rely on post offices to deliver necessary medicine and supplies, especially in underserved rural areas.
House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Gerry Conolly, who runs the subcommittee that oversees the Postal Service, sounded the alarm that the agency could run out of funding altogether by June if Congress doesn’t act soon.
'Based on a number of briefings and warnings this week about a critical fall-off in mail across the country, it has become clear that the Postal Service will not survive the summer without immediate help from Congress and the White House,' the two said in a March 23 joint statement, calling on Congress to appropriate $25 million in emergency funds to the agency.

As states have steadily expanded absentee and mail-in voting over the past two decades, the proportion of Americans voting in-person on election day has declined from 90% in 1992 to 60% in 2016, according to the US Census Bureau.
But some Republicans have openly protested expanding vote by mail options because they believe it would hurt them politically.  Trump said in a recent 'Fox & Friends' appearance that the House's stimulus provisions had 'levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.'
Since then, Trump has continued to spread misinformation about the safety and security of voting by mail on his Twitter account, falsely claiming that it 'substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD,' which none of the available evidence on vote by mail supports.

* Donald Trump will make it IMPOSSIBLE to Vote-by-Mail,
* And Trump will be President for four more years.
If we don’t act fast, it’ll all be over. So please, donate whatever you can. If we can raise $100,000 by tomorrow night we can save the post office!

This exclusive poll is registered to Alex . Please respond within [1] hour for your response to count in our data.
Trump just announced Amy Coney Barrett as his choice for Supreme Court Justice. The stakes could not be higher. The very fabric of our Democracy is at risk.
NOW: Trump is SHAKING at the idea of being impeached by House Democrats again. This would totally RUIN his evil Supreme Court plans!
Trump has committed so many impeachable crimes this year alone -- from intentionally covering up the COVID-19 outbreak to kidnapping peaceful protestors.
He deserves to be impeached so Amy Coney Barrett can be BLOCKED! This could change EVERYTHING!
But first, we need to know what Democrats in Virginia think about Trump’s impeachment and the Supreme Court. We need just [10] more responses!

Business Insider explains it best: (we’ve included the most important parts)
Business Insider: Trump Reportedly Rejected Approving a Bailout Package that would Rescue the US Postal Service, and It Could Be a Disaster for States Trying to Expand Voting by Mail
The United States has plunged the US Postal Service into dire financial straits, as more Americans than ever rely on post offices to deliver necessary medicine and supplies, especially in underserved rural areas.
House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Gerry Conolly, who runs the subcommittee that oversees the Postal Service, sounded the alarm that the agency could run out of funding altogether by June if Congress doesn’t act soon.
'Based on a number of briefings and warnings this week about a critical fall-off in mail across the country, it has become clear that the Postal Service will not survive the summer without immediate help from Congress and the White House,' the two said in a March 23 joint statement, calling on Congress to appropriate $25 million in emergency funds to the agency.
REPLY REQUIRED:
TELL CONGRESS TO SAVE THE POST OFFICE
SIGN YOUR NAME →
As states have steadily expanded absentee and mail-in voting over the past two decades, the proportion of Americans voting in-person on election day has declined from 90% in 1992 to 60% in 2016, according to the US Census Bureau.
But some Republicans have openly protested expanding vote by mail options because they believe it would hurt them politically.  Trump said in a recent 'Fox & Friends' appearance that the House's stimulus provisions had 'levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.'
Since then, Trump has continued to spread misinformation about the safety and security of voting by mail on his Twitter account, falsely claiming that it 'substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD,' which none of the available evidence on vote by mail supports.

The U.S. Postal Service is a critical and beloved institution.
And their role in delivering millions of mail-in ballots this November will prove to be critical to the 2020 Election.

Hey Alex,
We emailed you last week about the breaking Supreme Court decision REQUIRING Trump to release his tax returns...
But NBC just reported: ""Appeals Court temporarily blocks New York prosecutor from obtaining Trump tax returns.""
We're devastated. Trump's lawyers could cover up his crimes FOREVER!!
So we’re giving you one more chance to sign our petition to FORCE Trump to COMPLY with the Supreme Court and RELEASE his tax returns:

SUPREME COURT RULING: Donald J. Trump Must Release His Tax Returns
'US Supreme Court rules Trump must turn over financial records' - Al Jazeera
100,000 URGENT SIGNATURES NEEDED TO FORCE DONALD J. TRUMP TO COMPLY WITH THE SUPREME COURT AND RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS >>
I, ALEX, DEMAND TRUMP RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS >>
This petition is registered to [[EMAIL_REDACTED]]. Your signature is required before 11:59PM. Failure to sign could result in Trump getting off the hook for his crimes.
Alex -- It’s happening.
The Supreme Court ruled Donald Trump MUST hand over his taxes. Once his crimes are exposed, Trump will LOSE his bid for the White House!!
So Trump’s corrupt lawyers are fighting to tooth and nail to COVER-UP his tax returns.
They’re ignoring the Supreme Court. It’s OUTRIGHT corruption!!
If we collect 100,000 signatures DEMANDING Trump’s tax returns → we can expose Trump for the FRAUD and LIAR that he is!
But that means we need your signature before midnight. Without your signature, Trump will go totally FREE. Can you SIGN NOW? We still need [7] signatures from 60521 to meet our goal! >>

But she was murdered in her sleep by 3 Louisville Police officers. The invading officers were not fired or charged with a crime.
We need 100,000 activists to demand justice. Add your name now >>
JUSTICE FOR BREONNA TAYLOR: DEMAND THE INVADING OFFICERS ARE CHARGED WITH MURDER ➞
Alex, we need you to remember this name: Breonna Taylor.
Breonna Taylor was an award-winning EMT and First Responder from Louisville, KY who risked her own health and safety to serve her community during Covid-19. Her life mattered, Alex.
Breonna Taylor
But Breonna was murdered by the Louisville Police Department at her home while sleeping. They barged in without identifying themselves to look for drugs that were never found and for a person who did not even reside in Breonna’s residence.
Breonna’s life was stolen. But the three police officers who invaded her home are STILL gainfully employed and have yet to be arrested and charged with murder.
The only person who was charged was Breonna’s boyfriend, who shot at the door in self-defense when the officers refused to identify themselves.
We’re beyond disgusted at this horrific disregard for Black life. So we’re calling for justice.
We won’t rest until these offenders are held accountable for their crime. Sign on to demand the invading officers are charged with the murder of Breonna Taylor →
JUSTICE FOR BREONNA TAYLOR: DEMAND THE INVADING OFFICERS ARE CHARGED WITH MURDER ➞
Black Americans, especially Black essential workers like Breonna, deserve the right to sleep peacefully in their own home, free from harm.
This is an injustice that cannot be ignored. And it will take an army of grassroots activists like you, Alex, to finally be taken seriously by Kentucky State Officials.

Trump is announcing his nominee tomorrow. We need 100,000 Democrats to sign the petition by 9am if we want to save the Supreme Court.

\--He sent federal agents to kidnap peaceful protestors.
\--He abused the Department of Justice for personal gain.
\--AND SO MUCH MORE.
He deserves to be impeached. If that happens, Trump would be held accountable AND his Supreme Court nomination would be delayed!

308,"BREAKING: JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS DEMAND OFFICER WHO SHOT JACOB BLAKE BE CHARGED
Kamala Harris
Joe Biden
We need 100,000 Democrats to stand with Biden and Harris NOW and demand justice for Jacob Blake. Sign your name →
I DEMAND JUSTICE. ADD MY NAME ➞
Jacob Blake is innocent. But that didn’t stop Kenosha police officers from shooting him 7 times in the back for no reason.
But the officers who shot Blake, leaving him paralyzed for life, still haven’t been charged with any crime -- it’s unbelievable, Alex.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are DEMANDING the officer who shot Blake be charged and held accountable for his crime, and they need EVERY good Democrat standing with them to call for IMMEDIATE justice.
Alex, Biden and Harris need 100,000 activists to sign on TODAY. Justice cannot wait. Sign your name now →
I DEMAND JUSTICE. ADD MY NAME ➞
Alex -- justice must be served.
Jacob Blake was shot in front of his three small children. He spent the following days in the hospital fighting for his life. He’s paralyzed.
“Dismantling systemic racism starts with demanding justice and holding offenders accountable. Based on what I've seen, it seems the officer should be charged.”
Kamala Harris
Jacob Blake is innocent. But his innocence couldn’t protect him from the horrors of police brutality. Just like it couldn’t protect George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and countless more.
What makes this all even worse is that Kenosha cops were seen cozying up to white supremacists in the ensuing protests. Their racism runs deep.
So we’re standing with Biden and Harris to DEMAND the officer who shot Blake be charged.
Biden and Harris need every Good Democrat standing with them to DEMAND justice for Jacob Blake. Sign on to demand the officer who shot Blake be charged →
I DEMAND JUSTICE. ADD MY NAME ➞
Black Americans deserve the right to get into their own car, free from harm.
This is an injustice that cannot be ignored. And it will take an army of grassroots activists like you, Alex, to finally be taken seriously.
Sign your name to stand with Biden and Harris and DEMAND justice for Jacob Blake NOW →

Donald Trump has been abusing his position since the first day he became president.
He’s used his power and influence to end criminal investigations and avoid conviction.

But Congress will only charge Trump if it’s what the American people want.

He deserves to be impeached. If that happens, Trump would be held accountable AND his Supreme Court nomination would be delayed!

SHOULD TRUMP BE PROSECUTED FOR HIS CRIMES WHEN HE LEAVES OFFICE?
Trump
YES >>
NO >>
UNSURE >>
PLEASE BE HONEST. OFFICIAL POLL CONDUCTED 09/06/2020, COLLECTING RESPONSES UNTIL 11:59PM.
Trump escaped impeachment simply because the GOP saved his hide.
But in the impeachment trial, we saw hard evidence that Trump obstructed justice.
So Kamala Harris, speaking as a former prosecutor, is simply trying to uphold the law. Trump is not above the law and he must be held accountable.
But charging an ex-President (even one as CORRUPT and CRIMINAL as Trump) is controversial, so we need to gauge support among informed Democrats.
The Department of Justice will NEVER act unless we show public support, so we need your response immediately >>

Trump
YES >>
NO >>
UNSURE >>
PLEASE BE HONEST. OFFICIAL POLL CONDUCTED 09/20/2020, COLLECTING RESPONSES UNTIL 11:59PM.
Trump escaped impeachment simply because the GOP saved his hide.
But in the impeachment trial, we saw hard evidence that Trump obstructed justice.
So Kamala Harris, speaking as a former prosecutor, is simply trying to uphold the law. Trump is not above the law and he must be held accountable.
But charging an ex-President (even one as CORRUPT and CRIMINAL as Trump) is controversial, so we need to gauge support among informed Democrats.
The Department of Justice will NEVER act unless we show public support, so we need your response immediately >>

Trump's presidency has been called ""one of the worst in modern history"" by political experts.
Now some of America's veterans are labeling him ""America's #1 Traitor"":
➣ He defends confederate soldiers,
➣ Ordered violence against peaceful protestors,
➣ And used the Senate to cover-up his crimes during Impeachment.
That's why we cannot allow Trump to win another term. So we're collecting organic data from local Democrats to help us formulate our strategy.
As 1 of 4 top Democratic representatives of your city, your input will have a monumental impact on our 2020 strategy.
So please, don't hesitate to let us know:
Do you think Donald Trump is a Traitor?

3 MINUTE TIMER
Due to the small sample size of this poll, it is imperative you respond within three minutes of opening this email.
Without your input, we will be in a blind spot in our 2020 Election Strategy to make Trump a one-term President.

335,"This week in Wisconsin, our community was thrown into chaos as a police officer shot our neighbor Jacob Blake in Kenosha, leaving him paralyzed. Two days later, peaceful protest turned into a crime scene when a 17-year old white nationalist from Illinois crossed into our state and murdered more of our neighbors with an AK-15. We must demand better.
Amanda Stuck for Congress
Content warning: this email contains descriptions of police violence.
Alex,
This week, I’ve been heartbroken watching what our friends in Kenosha — and Black Americans across the country — are experiencing.
On Sunday, our community was thrown into chaos as a police officer shot Jacob Blake after he’d broken up a fight. His punishment? An officer shot him in the back 7 times, and he is now paralyzed.
Just days later, a man was murdered, and others injured, by a white nationalist at a protest over the shooting of Jacob Blake.
He walked through our streets unrestrained, and even assisted, by local law enforcement.
We all must ask the question: why was a Black man breaking up a fight shot in the back while a white teenager who’d just murdered a man was able to walk down the street past officers and return across state lines to his home in Illinois?
This question lives at the intersection of gun violence, police brutality, and racial injustice — how do we implement systemic changes to address the pressing civil rights issue of our time?
I understand that members of our communities are rightfully angry.
There will never be justice for Jacob Blake — he should have never been harmed. No action can make him whole again.
But, together, we must continue supporting our local Black Lives Matter chapters, and demanding better from our police departments.
Fixing the issues of systemic racism that are running rampant in our country will take all of us. So we must collectively stand up and speak out against these injustices.
We can and must do better.

Friends:
Ed was my professor in law school and we need his voice on the Supreme Court because his willingness to care about and help his students as well as his depth of constitutional knowledge helped guide me through law school and become the lawyer and person I am today. I endorsed Ed because his scholarly insight and his breadth of legal knowledge will bring the Wisconsin Supreme Court a perspective they need.
You know a person by how they chose to spend their time and their career when no one was watching. Ed Fallone is not just an accomplished legal scholar, and an experienced lawyer in both the criminal and civil court systems. He has also devoted thousands of hours as a volunteer, leading nonprofit organizations that provide low cost lawyers to working families in Wisconsin and that worked with at-risk youth to keep them in school and out of jail.
You can hear Ed tell his story by visiting his webpage, and clicking on the “Media” tab:
[[URL REDACTED]]
The concept of “justice” involves more than just charging crimes and imposing sentences. It involves a commitment to making the system work for everyone, without regard to how much money they have. It means recognizing that working families face challenges that other families don’t face. And it includes searching for ways to help our youth before they become defendants in the courtroom.
We need a fighter for working families on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Ed Fallone has been a fighter for justice in Wisconsin for almost 30 years.
Want to ensure Ed wins the election on February 18? Here are three things you can do:
1. Commit to ensuring 10 of your friends are registered to vote and remind them to vote for Ed. Text or email them and tell them to vote Fallone for Justice!
2. Like Ed’s page on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. The links are at the bottom of this email. Invite your friends to like his page. Share, comment, and like his posts.
3. Share the media page with all of your friends. You can share on social media or email it to your friends and family.
And please donate now, so that Ed can keep fighting for justice from a seat on Wisconsin’s highest Court.

Hello,
I'd like to tell you a story about Jon that you may not know. Nearly three years ago, I began doing some work in the community to stop domestic violence. A woman and her four-year old child had been murdered by her ex-boyfriend, who then killed himself. The case made an imprint on me. A mother and her child were dead. There was a vigil and some media coverage of the deaths, but nobody seemed to be asking many questions.
I had been prosecuting domestic violence cases for about four years at that time and believed more could be done in the community to stop interpersonal violence. I began meeting with experts in the field in Kalamazoo and throughout Michigan, learning about the role that trauma, and witnessing or experiencing violence as a child has on people who go on to become abusive themselves. I learned that suffering trauma is the leading indicator that a person will hurt someone else.
First, we wrestled with the question of which action or set of actions to take to create real change in the community. We knew that trauma contributed significantly to interpersonal violence in the community, but we weren't sure how to address it. After much discussion, the answer came in the form of a new treatment court - a court that treated trauma as a root cause of crime and family violence. Just as Drug Courts treat addiction to reduce crime and recidivism, this court program would treat trauma to reduce violence perpetration. The concept became known as the Kalamazoo County Trauma & Resiliency Court, a first of its kind endeavor in our country.
Next, we were faced with the question of where to turn to provide funding for trauma survivors and their families. Treatment for trauma survivors would help reduce interpersonal violence in the community, but as we all know, treatment costs money. And trauma survivors often lack the resources to pay for quality treatment out of pocket. Particularly, the kind of treatment that effectively calms trauma reactivity and heals families in the process.
Jon Hoadley answered the call. I met with Jon to discuss our efforts and he immediately offered to help. He fought for, and won, funding in the state legislature to create the new treatment court program in Kalamazoo County.
The Trauma & Resiliency Court program will fundamentally change the way we understand and treat trauma survivors in the community, offering survivors help and healing, instead of more pain and punishment. It will mean fewer trauma victims and more resilience in and through the justice system.
I want you to know the critical role Jon played in helping trauma survivors in this community. Nobody has ever done anything like this anywhere in the country or, so far as I know, the world. Unfortunately, the voices of trauma survivors are often ignored in the criminal justice system, as this survivor details in this piece. They repeatedly ask for more resources to treat and heal trauma, but are instead given pain and punishment. Jon is helping to end this injustice in Kalamazoo and bend the arc just a little more.
This is yet one more reason to support Jon Hoadley with your time and money. Jon is doing more for trauma survivors in this community than Upton ever has or ever will. He is quietly, but fundamentally, changing the way we view and treat survivors in the justice system.
I hope you’ll join me in supporting Jon’s campaign.
In politics these days, we too often see the mean and the ugly, the distortion of truth, hurtful words and misdeeds that have come to define the Trump era. Upton, through the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), benefits from this kind of politics.
Jon is different. Jon cares about people. Jon cares about this community. He's fighting for Kalamazoo in Lansing each and every day, and will do the same in Washington, D.C. when we send him to Congress this November. Let's help him get there.
I know this was a long email. If you've gotten to this line, thank you. Let's give Jon the best thanks we can in the coming weeks by voting to retire Upton.
Sincerely yours,
Joe

338,"Lizzie Fletcher Fails to Sign Abbott's Back the Blue Pledge
Today, Representative Lizzie Fletcher refused to sign a pledge to protect Texas cities from the defund the police movement. Wesley Hunt proudly signed the pledge, put forward by Governor Greg Abbott, which states:
""I sign this Texas Backs the Blue Pledge to oppose any efforts to defund the police and to show my support for the brave law enforcement officers who risk their lives to protect and serve. Defunding our police departments would invite crime into our communities and put people in danger. That is why I pledge to support any measure that discourages or stops efforts to defund police departments in Texas.
Our law enforcement officers have our backs every single day, and we need to show them that Texans have their backs.""
Efforts are already underway to cut police budgets in several Texas cities. In August, Austin’s City Council cut the Austin Police Department by one third and shortly thereafter the city of Dallas moved to defund $7 million from the Dallas Police Department’s overtime appropriations.
The far-left movement to cut funding for our police departments makes our cities less safe and puts vulnerable communities at risk. Wesley Hunt supports bringing positive reforms to our police departments but defunding the police does not accomplish that mission.
“Lizzie Fletcher's failure to sign a pledge stating that she won't defund the police should be disqualifying to voters in the 7th District,"" said Campaign Manager Jim Hilk. ""Her failure to sign this pledge mirrors her failure to stand up to the radical progressives in the Democratic party in Congress pushing to destroy Houston's energy jobs, eliminate employer sponsored healthcare and raise taxes on all Texans.""
Hunt is a Houston native and battle-tested leader willing to stand up for the 7th Congressional District. While his opponent Lizzie Fletcher made Pelosi Speaker of the House and refuses to condemn the most liberal of Democratic priorities, Wesley is a problem solver who will work with both sides to bring results home to the 7th District.

Patriot,
Our final TV ad for the general election went live this morning. Click here to watch it.
It is critical that our message gets out, so we can spread the truth about Mayor De La Isla’s reckless record. The Topeka violent crime rate has skyrocketed by almost 46% under her watch, but instead of adding police officers, she has defunded nearly 10% of police jobs, while taking lavish taxpayer-funded trips to Hawaii and LA.
We need to make sure this stays on the air. Donate Now to help us spread this message to cut through Mayor De La Isla's lies.
Here are some actions that took place under her leadership:
1. Topeka Police jobs cut by nearly 10%
2. Violent crime in Topeka skyrocketed 46%
3. While the police lost jobs, she used taxpayer money for vacations in places like Hawaii and California
In contrast, Jake LaTurner has returned over $80 million to taxpayers, because he knows every penny counts. You earned it, you should keep it. In Congress, Jake will work to jumpstart our economy with good-paying jobs from Main Street to the factory, boost take-home pay for Kansans, and bring our supply chain home from China.

SIGN ON
The Justice in Policing Act is a long-overdue first step towards putting in place policing reforms that will ensure equality for Black Americans — under the law.
This legislation will ban the use of chokeholds (which killed George Floyd), no-knock warrants in drug cases (which killed Breonna Taylor), and make lynching (which killed Ahmaud Arbery) a federal hate crime. It will improve police training and accountability and make it possible for communities to begin to rebuild trust in law enforcement.
We don’t have a minute to wait. Now is the time to reform the police system.

I have never had to worry about mistreatment from police because of my skin color — but I understand that the experience of Black America is very different.
Right now, I am listening, learning, and taking action to ensure that our nation finally addresses systemic racism and white supremacy.
I am committed to working with my colleagues and community to achieve equal justice for Black Americans — which is why I am asking for your help today.

Today is Juneteenth. President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation to declare an end to the vile institution of slavery in America in 1862. But, many enslaved people were still held captive even after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed.
On June 19, 1865, the word of freedom finally reached a community of enslaved people in Galveston, Texas. It was on that day that Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, arrived in Galveston to declare freedom for the people who were still enslaved. It had taken nearly two and a half years for this news to travel to the hundreds of thousands of enslaved people still remaining in Texas.
The celebration of rejoice and reunion that followed is one we continue to this day.
On this Juneteenth, I am taking time to remember our history, to rejoice in the progress we have made and reflect on the enormity of the work we have left to do.
The truth is that even once Black Americans were emancipated, our ancestors continued to face enormous barriers: to live free from racism and racialized violence, to work with dignity, to vote, to build wealth and economic security for themselves and for future generations.
Today, as those barriers remain, so must our commitment to justice.
That is why I am working to push Congress to act to take the transformative steps needed to address the hate and systemic racism that is still so deeply rooted in our laws and institutions. We must finally make lynching a federal crime, reform our criminal justice system, and critically, intervene to create more transparent and accountable police departments.
The injustices we must confront are interrelated: from environmental injustice that disproportionately affects Black Americans to disparities in health access and outcomes to the staggering racial wealth gap that disadvantages Black families. We have so much work to do.
Today, as I honor the sacrifices made by my ancestors and rejoice in their grace and relentless hope for this country, I renew my commitment to fighting for true justice and equality for all.
I hope you will join me.

We can’t believe it, but President Trump just attacked Cory AGAIN team — the third time in a matter of a week.
Last night at his political rally in Iowa — which defied CDC guidance and put hundreds of people at risk in the middle of a pandemic — Trump came for Cory by saying “stupid people like Cory Booker,"" and then mocked Newark, New Jersey.
Clearly Trump is reaching here, given the fact that Cory is a Rhodes Scholar who loves the city of Newark where he successfully ushered in an economic boom, drove down crime, and rooted out corruption during his tenure as Mayor.
Let’s show Trump once again that the people have Cory’s back, especially now that we’re only 19 days away from Election Day. Pitch in $10 or more to support Cory’s re-election and efforts to flip the Senate in less than three weeks:

Friend,
Since the tragic murder of George Floyd at the hands of police, the calls for justice have been loud and clear. Now is the time for policy change and legislative action.
That's why I'm a partner in the effort, along with Kamala Harris and Democratic Congressional leaders, to introduce the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, a set of comprehensive reforms that will create stronger systems of transparency and accountability while bringing needed reform to police departments across the country.
If you're ready for transformative change to America's policing, add your name right now to become a co-sponsor of this new legislation.
ADD YOUR NAME
As millions of Americans have continued to rise up and unite for justice in every corner of the country, I've spent the past few weeks working closely with Senator Harris as well as the Congressional Black Caucus to develop legislation that will address the unchecked bias and lack of accountability in our nation's police departments.
This bill is just the first step to stopping the gut-wrenching injustices that have taken the lives of too many Black Americans for decades on end.
It aims to shine a light on abuse and corruption by creating a federal database of police misconduct, and strengthening the consequences for such actions by ending the ""qualified immunity"" that has long protected police officers from being held accountable for violating a person's rights.
It would also prevent the escalation and brutality that killed George Floyd and Breonna Taylor by prohibiting chokeholds, banning no-knock warrants in drug cases, and putting an end to racial and religious profiling.
And finally, at long last, lynching would become a federal crime.
It's been decades since legislation to reform policing like this has been introduced in Washington, and quite frankly it's long overdue. Ending systemic racism will not happen overnight or with one bill, but through this legislation, we can make real progress.
Join me in supporting the passage of these critical police reforms by adding your name now.
ADD YOUR NAME
Together, let's rise and reform the system so we can end the institutionalized violence against Black lives in America.

#
Alex -
Yesterday, Congressman Ro Khanna and I led 21 lawmakers in a call on Donald Trump to de-escalate tensions with Iran and prevent war in the Middle East.
We sent a letter directly to the president calling out his reckless decision to assassinate General Soleimani and demanding authorization from Congress for any military action against Iran.
We need you to add your voice to ours:
Add your name to become a citizen co-signer and tell Donald Trump not to go to war with Iran. The American people do not want another endless war in the Middle East.
Donald Trump started this situation when he withdrew from the Iran Deal and imposed crushing sanctions on Iran.
Now is the time to pursue a diplomatic strategy that will defuse tensions and prevent further movement by Iran toward a nuclear-weapons program.
Our letter called on the Trump administration to take clear steps that would not only help de-escalate the situation, but would also get us off our march to war.
As part of that, we made it clear to Trump that any further military action against Iran must be authorized by Congress. We also demanded that the administration tell the public what specific “imminent threats” existed that led to this assassination — the most extreme choice on the administration’s list of options.
We also told them not to make any further threats to Iranian civilians or cultural sites. They must recognize that this action would be a war crime and violation of our international agreements.
If you agree that Donald Trump must cease his escalations with Iran and get us off a path to war, add your name to our letter as a citizen co-signer.
War with Iran would cost untold deaths and trillions of dollars. We must do everything we can to stop that from happening.

Alex -
Last night, Iran attacked air bases in Iraq that house U.S. troops and personnel. Fortunately, no lives were lost, but Donald Trump must take responsibility for the lives of our servicemembers, civilians, and allies that were put in danger with his dangerous escalation of conflict with Iran.
Over the weekend, Donald Trump tweeted threats of retaliation if Iran were to strike the United States.
He said that his administration has targeted 52 sites, including cultural sites, that he would hit should such an attack take place.
Let me be very clear here: Attacking cultural sites is a war crime, and the Trump administration knows it.
Imagine if the Statue of Liberty were attacked. Or the Tao Pueblo in New Mexico. Or the memorials along the National Mall. That’s why destroying cultural sites is a violation of international law.
The United States Senate must act to prevent any further escalation and block Donald Trump from launching unlawful military actions. We are dangerously close to going to war with Iran when we should instead be working to put a stop to the endless wars in the Middle East.
Today, I introduced a resolution condemning Trump’s threats to target cultural sites, and I need you to stand with me on this issue.
Add your name now to support my resolution condemning Donald Trump’s threats against Iran. We cannot allow him to commit war crimes.
His actions over the past week have made our country less safe. We cannot allow his threats to go unchallenged.
Thank you for standing with me in this fight.

We are excited to announce the release of our first TV ad. You can head over to our YouTube channel to subscribe and check out all of our ads by clicking the link HERE.​
## Standing With Trump Against Impeachment
Even before President Trump was sworn into office, the radical Left and Fake News media began working overtime to impeach him. This sham trial led by Nancy Pelosi and her socialist ""Squad,"" is not only trying to undo the results of the 2016 election but also steal the election in 2020.
Bill Hagerty will stand with President Trump to put an end to this impeachment witch hunt and get our Senate back to the important business of the American people. As Tennessee's next Senator, Bill will work each day to help advance President Trump's ""America First"" agenda so that we can secure our borders and continue our winning streak by keeping America great.

Hagerty's Statement On The Passing Of RBG
For more than two decades, Justice Ginsburg served on the Supreme Court, and she blazed trails for women and believed deeply in public service. President Donald Trump can – and should – nominate a constitutionalist to fill this Supreme Court vacancy; the future of our nation for generations to come depends on it.
Read Hagerty's full statement HERE.
#TeamHagerty Stands With Law Enforcement
Last week, Hagerty announced he has earned the support of over 100 members of the law enforcement community across Tennessee. Across the country, we are seeing violence and anarchy in several Democrat-run cities, as many leaders call to defund and dismantle police departments. It is unacceptable. In the Senate, Bill will fight for the men and women who stand on the thin blue line. They put their lives on the line every day to answer the call to protect and serve our communities, and I stand with them 120 percent.

ICYMI: Under Trump, US Marks Historic Peace In Middle East
President Trump and his Administration are making unprecedented, historic strides in advancing peace in the Middle East. In the last month alone, the Trump Administration has brokered and now signed two historic peace deals: between the United Arab Emirates and Israel, and Bahrain and Israel. These are critical steps toward stability in the Middle East, which set the precedent for peace and economic prosperity throughout the region. In the Senate, Bill will continue to work closely with the Trump Administration to ensure the U.S. continues to stand with Israel and work together for peace in the years ahead.
Read the full editorial HERE.
Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! We have another election to win in November. This time, it's not just sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must reelect President Donald Trump for four more years and expand our Republican supermajority in Tennessee so we can continue to stand up to the radical liberals who want to make America a socialist country.

#TeamHagerty Stands With Those Affected By Tornadoes
Last night’s tornadoes in Tennessee were devastating. Team Hagerty is praying for all Tennesseans affected by this disaster. We will continue to monitor the aftermath of this storm and will provide updates and information as it becomes available. We are thankful to President Trump for acting swiftly to work with Governor Bill Lee and local leaders to provide relief. The President will be in Tennesse on Friday to survey the devastated areas.
Tennesseans are resilient. We are strong and will come out of this stronger than ever before. Now is the time to reach out a hand to help friends and neighbors in need. To find out how you can help and to get information about resources in affected areas, visit our website HERE.
## In Case You Missed It...
Bill Hagerty released the first in a series of policy plans on Friday. ""Bill's Blueprint To Support Our Farmers"" outlines his commitment to support the 77,000 farmers in Tennessee. Bill learned the value of hard work at a young age while raising pigs and cattle and serving as the FFA president to his chapter. He understands the challenges that Tennessee farmers and agriculture workers face and will fight for them when he gets to the Senate. Be on the lookout as Bill releases more of his Blueprints to success for Tennesseans.
## Don't Miss Super Tuesday!
#TeamHagerty supports President Donald Trump because he is fighting for the American people and will protect the conservative values held by Tennesseans across the state. Today is your last chance to get out to the polls and cast your ballot for President Trump in the Presidential Preference Primary!

Mayor Rick Graham: Bloomberg's comments on farmers insulting
Our farmers must be well represented in Washington so that their products can be well represented across the globe. Bill Hagerty is running for the U.S. Senate this year and already has a proven track record of working with President Donald Trump to support our farmers, when he served as our Ambassador to Japan. I know that Bill Hagerty will work with President Trump, just as he did while Ambassador to Japan, to protect our farmers and make sure that they are treated fairly when it comes to trade. He has my support to be Tennessee’s next Senator.
Steve Osborn: Bill Hagerty’s Record Edges Dr. Manny Sethi’s Pledges
Since my meeting with the Bill, I spoke with conservative legislators in Nashville, who confirmed that Bill Hagerty is a man of faith, a conservative, and he has worked diligently for the betterment of the state. Taking everything into consideration, it is my conclusion that Bill Hagerty is the better candidate and will serve the nation and the state of Tennessee well, should he become our next U.S. Senator.
Jeff Broyles: Hagerty fights for conservatives
Bill’s broad range of experience both in business and government make him the best qualified for the job, period. He is a family man who not only displays the Christian conservative values we expect by those representing us but truly lives them in daily life. He genuinely cares about Tennesseans and is fully equipped to go to battle in Washington in our defense. After looking him in the eye, I can fully vouch for the fact that he is a pro-life, Second Amendment custodian in full support of our president’s agenda. Without hesitation, I intend to support and vote for him and humbly ask that you do as well.

One Year Of Team Hagerty
Last week, we celebrated one year since Bill Hagerty announced his campaign to represent Tennessee in the U.S. Senate. There is less than a month until early voting begins, and Team Hagerty isn’t slowing down. We're so grateful for the love and support Tennesseans have shown us throughout this journey so far. #TeamHagerty is going to keep pushing and continue our momentum until we can call him Senator Hagerty!
You can watch the full video HERE.
NFIB Is On #TeamHagerty
The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) PAC, the largest small business association in the United States, has endorsed Bill's campaign for U.S. Senate. Now more than ever, small businesses need leaders who understand the importance of reducing regulatory red-tape in a manner that creates an environment that supports small business growth. As Tennessee’s former chief economic leader and a businessman, Bill understands what it takes to stimulate economies and help small businesses. In the U.S. Senate, Bill will be a strong advocate of Tennessee’s small businesses.
Read the press release HERE.
Bill's Statement On President Trump's SCOTUS Nominees
Following President Trump’s announcement of potential Supreme Court nominees for his second term, Bill released a statement praising the President for continuing to support and nominate strict constitutionalist judges. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would work to destroy our democracy – packing the courts with liberal activist judges who seek to make law from the bench. We must re-elect President Donald Trump and send Bill to the U.S. Senate to confirm strong constitutionalist nominees who will not legislate from the bench.
Read the full statement HERE.
Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! We have another election to win in November. This time, it's not just sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must reelect President Donald Trump for four more years and expand our Republican supermajority in Tennessee so we can continue to stand up to the radical liberals who want to push America toward a socialist state.

Mayor Dean Dickey: Why former Mayor Dean Dickey supports Bill Hagerty
In Tennessee, Bill Hagerty is the only U.S. Senate candidate that has been endorsed by President Trump. As President Trump’s former Ambassador to Japan, I know that Bill is ready to hit the ground running on Day 1 to stand with the President to fight back against the Democrats’ radical liberal agenda. He is not afraid to stand up to Nancy Pelosi, “The Squad” and RINOs like Mitt Romney. President Trump backs Bill Hagerty, and so do I.
Jeff Broyles: Hagerty fights for conservatives
Bill’s broad range of experience both in business and government make him the best qualified for the job, period. He is a family man who not only displays the Christian conservative values we expect by those representing us but truly lives them in daily life.

Without hesitation, I intend to support and vote for him and humbly ask that you do as well.
Kenneth Eaton: Hagerty As US senator, Hagerty would fight socialist agenda
As the commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development under Gov. Bill Haslam, Hagerty worked with companies such as Nissan and Bridgestone to help bring hundreds of jobs to Tennessee. As our state’s next U.S. senator, I know he will support bills that will benefit Tennessee’s booming economy. He will fight for lower taxes and vote against socialists, whose expensive plans will hurt Tennesseans tremendously. According to the Tennessee Department of Labor & Workforce Development, unemployment was 3.9% in 2019 — a record low in the state. Let’s keep this record going with Bill Hagerty representing us in the United States senate. He has already proven he is the man for the job.

ICYMI: Tele-Town Hall With President Trump
Last week, President Donald Trump joined #TeamHagerty for a tele-town hall to kick off early voting in Tennessee. While speaking to Bill and Tennesseans across the state, President Trump said, ""I'm calling to tell everyone in Tennessee to get out and vote early. You can get out there and vote right now for Bill Hagerty for Senate... He was one of my earliest supporters. He worked on my campaign in 2016, and my transition after we won. He's been so great in so many ways.""
You can listen to the full tele-town hall HERE.
WATCH: Massachusetts Manny Sethi's True View On Obamacare
Today, #TeamHagerty released a new ad exposing the real Massachusetts Manny Sethi, who says one thing and does another depending on where he lives and what is politically expedient at the time. Tennesseans cannot trust Massachusetts Manny. He has been masquerading as a conservative who supports President Trump when in reality he is the most liberal candidate in the race. Watch the ad HERE and learn more about Massachusetts Manny HERE.
Early Voting Is Happening Now
Early voting is underway in Tennessee for the Republican Senate Primary. #TeamHagerty is proud to have the support of Tennesseans, including over 1,000 local leaders in communities across the state. Make sure you get out to the polls and cast your ballot to send Bill to the U.S. Senate.
You can find your polling location HERE.
WATCH: This Madness Must Stop
Our country is under attack as the angry liberal mob seeks to destroy the fabric of our country and erase our history. Next, they’ll attack our religious statues and erase our religious freedoms. Now, more than ever, we need someone with a backbone to stand up to the angry mob and protect our conservative values. In the Senate, Bill will stand tall with President Trump to put an end to this madness and support our law enforcement officers, who risk their lives every day to keep our communities safe.
Watch the ad HERE.
Join #TeamHagerty & Sen. Tom Cotton
This Friday, July 24, #TeamHagerty is hosting Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas in Clarksville, Tennessee. Sen. Cotton is a good friend to #TeamHagerty and has spoken out about his support for Bill's campaign for Senate. You can listen to Bill and Sen. Cotton's recent tele-town hall HERE.

ICYMI: Bill's Statements On ANTIFA
With the recent riots around the country, including Tennessee, Bill Hagerty issued a statement on Saturday night calling for the end of violence and looting by Antifa. Yesterday, Bill issued another statement calling President Trump to use the Insurrection Act to mobilize active-duty military forces in order to defend our communities from further acts of domestic terrorism, and the President listened! Antifa is a hate group that commits violent acts of domestic terrorism. And it's past time for it to be designated as such. Read Bill's full statement HERE.
Veterans For Hagerty
Last week, Team Hagerty released a coalition that includes over 1,200 Tennessee veterans from all branches of our distinguished military. Following the release of Bill's Blueprint To Support Our Veterans, the Veterans for Hagerty coalition has released videos sharing their support of Bill. Deputy Speaker Curtis Johnson, a member of the coalition, even published an editorial in the Leaf Chronicle stating, ""I am proud to join many other veterans across Tennessee in supporting Bill Hagerty for the United States Senate because he will stand alongside President Trump to support our veterans and make sure they have access to quality health care and job opportunities.""
Freedom is not free, and we must always take care of those who have risked so much to protect our American way of life. As your next Senator, Bill will continue to work alongside President Trump to ensure our veterans are equipped with the tools they need to transition successfully into civilian life. Find out more about Veterans For Hagerty HERE.
WATCH: Tele-Townhall With Lara Trump
We are so proud to have another member of the Trump family on Team Hagerty. Last week, Lara Trump became the second member of the Trump family to hold an event in support of Hagerty's campaign for Senate. Lara gave Team Hagerty an update on the President’s campaign and discussed the need to retain a Republican majority in the U.S. Senate. Listen to the full tele-townhall HERE.

Congressman Fleischmann Is On #TeamHagerty
Congressman Fleischmann Endorses Bill Hagerty
Congressman Chuck Fleischmann, representing Tennessee’s 3rd congressional district, joined President Donald Trump in endorsing Bill Hagerty’s campaign for Senate last week, highlighting his business experience. When speaking about his endorsement, Congressman Fleischmann said, ""Bill Hagerty is a trustworthy conservative businessman, just like President Trump, who has my complete support. Bill’s economic background more than qualifies him for the U.S. Senate. As businesses in Tennessee and around the country begin to open again, we need someone like Bill helping lead our state. Tennesseans will be well-served with Bill in the Senate.”

Made In The USA
In the wake of China unleashing the Wuhan coronavirus upon the world, resulting in a massive loss of life and the destruction of our economy, Bill released a new TV ad highlighting his readiness to stand up to China and his experience working with President Donald Trump to get our economy going again. In the Senate, Bill will stand strong against the predatory practices of Communist China, just like he did as Ambassador to Japan.

Bill's Statement On Tennessee Planned Parenthood
Standing Against The Angry Mob
Last week, in Tennessee, Planned Parenthood burned the American flag - they should be sent to jail. Nothing is more disrespectful than burning the American flag. Too many men and women have given their lives defending our flag and our freedoms. This behavior disrespects America and those who have been willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for our precious freedom. What we need now, more than ever, is law and order. We should defund Planned Parenthood, not the police. President Trump won’t stand for this, and neither will Bill. As our next Senator, Bill will stand up for America, and against the angry mob.

Last week, Bill released an editorital in the Tennesseean thanking the health professionals and first responders in Tennessee for working on the front lines of combatting the coronavirus in our state.

358,"The Chinese Communist regime’s efforts to conceal and destroy valuable evidence
Alex,
The Chinese Communist regime’s efforts to conceal and destroy valuable evidence - including silencing their own people - regarding the Wuhan coronavirus is the crime of the century and the greatest coverup in human history.
In our new ad, we're revealing the TRUTH about China and I need your help to keep it on the air.
Help Keep this Ad on the Air
The Communist Chinese leaders must be held accountable for the death and destruction leveled on their own people and for the widespread damage to the world’s health and economy.
In the Senate, I will continue to stand with President Trump to help put an end to Communist China’s deception about the origins and the impact of this deadly virus, along with holding organizations like the World Health Organization accountable for perpetuating the Communist regime’s propaganda.

Countdown To Early Voting
We're 8 days away from the start of early voting, and #TeamHagerty is ready to support Republicans up and down the ballot. Bill is traveling across the state, from Memphis to Mountain City, to talk with Tennesseans about what's important to us. Tennesseans want to send strong conservatives to Washington this November because conservative values are Tennessee values.
We Must Fill The Seat
President Trump has a constitutional duty to nominate a Supreme Court justice to fill the vacancy created by the passing of Justice Ginsburg. Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and their radical allies in the Democrat Party want to distract and threaten in a manner aimed at preventing the President from performing his duty. Last week, Team Hagerty released a video encouraging the President and the Republican Senate majority to fill the Supreme Court seat.
Watch the full video HERE.
Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! We have another election to win in November. This time, it's not just sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must reelect President Donald Trump for four more years and expand our Republican supermajority in Tennessee so we can continue to stand up to the radical liberals who want to make America a socialist country.

Justice Barrett proved herself highly qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. She is a well-respected jurist – a solid constitutionalist, who will steadfastly serve our nation. Justice Barrett’s confirmation is a vital step in protecting our constitutional rights. Should the Democrats retaliate by attempting to pack the court with liberal activist judges, Bill will oppose any effort to make the Supreme Court into a rubber stamp for the Democrats’ left-wing agenda.

Election Day Is One Week Away
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! It's not just about sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must re-elect President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for four more years and expand our Republican supermajority in Tennessee so we can continue to stand up to the radical liberals who want to make America a socialist country.

Hagerty Stands With Law Enforcement
Supporting Our Police Officers | Anderson County
Over the past couple of weeks, we have seen criminals and anarchists hijack First Amendment protests with a campaign for violence and crime. Dismantling and defunding our police departments will throw our country into chaos. This is the wrong message to send. Our law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every single day to keep our communities safe. They are the only thing standing between anarchy and your family's safety. As the next Senator for Tennessee, Bill will work to uphold the rule of law, stop ANTIFA, and fight to secure appropriate funding and support for our law enforcement officers. Read Hagerty's full statement on supporting our law enforcement officers HERE.
Bill Hagerty: Endorsed By SBA List
Last week, Team Hagerty released the latest in a series of policy plans: Bill's Blueprint To Protect The Right To Life. Tennesseans value life; we believe that all people — including the unborn — are valued. In his plan, Bill details how he will protect the right to life from socialist Democrats in Washington.
As the radical liberals look to implement their socialist agenda, which includes taxpayer-funded abortions, now more than ever we need conservative leaders in the Senate to protect our unborn children. That's why the Susan B. Anthony (SBA) List Candidate Fund PAC has joined President Trump in endorsing Bill's campaign. He has always said abortion takes a human life, and we must do everything we can to be a strong voice for the voiceless. Bill will stand up to end taxpayer-funded abortions and to defund Planned Parenthood once and for all. Find out more about SBA's endorsement HERE.
RSVP: Tele-Townhall With Marilyn Musgrave
Team Hagerty announced today that the Honorable Marilyn Musgrave, Vice President of Government Affairs for the Susan B. Anthony (SBA) List Candidate Fund PAC will join us for a tele-town hall on June 10th at 2:15 p.m. ET/1:15 p.m. CT. The tele-town hall will focus on providing Tennesseans with an update on the SBA List's latest issue campaigns and how they are working to support the right to life.

Let us know you'll be listening by responding to this RSVP.
Bill's Blueprint To Support Our Veterans
Last week, Bill released his latest in a series of policy plans: Bill's Blueprint To Support Our Veterans. Freedom is not free, and we must always take care of those who have risked so much to protect our American way of life. It’s crucial for the federal government to care for our military service members, who sacrifice so much. As the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Bill saw first-hand the dedication and impact of our military as they ensure the security of our nation and allies in a very challenging region. In his plan, Bill lays out how he will stand with President Donald Trump to ensure American veterans have access to the health care and benefits they were promised and have earned. Read the full plan HERE.
WATCH: Dr. Tedros Is China’s Enabler
Following President Donald Trump’s scathing letter to the World Health Organization (WHO) holding them accountable for enabling the Communist Chinese regime to misreport and cover-up valuable information regarding the Wuhan virus, #TeamHagerty released a timeline video exposing the WHO’s leader, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, for his close ties to Communist regime. Dr. Tedros has been a long time ally and enabler of the Communist Chinese regime. In the Senate, Bill will continue to work with President Trump to hold Communist China and the organizations it influences responsible for their complicity and cover-up of the Wuhan virus that put hundreds of thousands of lives and the world economy in danger. Watch the latest video exposing Dr. Tedros HERE.

READ: Bill's Latest Op-Ed In Fox Business
Bill Hagerty released an editorial in Fox Business with Andy Puzder calling out the Communist Chinese regime for acting more like a trade enemy than an ally. The op-ed, which was shared by the White House, points out the efforts of China’s Communist leadership to conceal and destroy evidence regarding COVID-19; including silencing their own people. China's actions in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 exposes the regime’s true intentions: to preserve their power and evade responsibility for their gross misconduct. Read Bill's latest editorial HERE.
ICYMI: Hillary Clinton Endorses #BeijingBiden
Last week, Hillary Clinton announced her endorsement of Joe ""Beijing"" Biden's campaign for president. Make no mistake- the two corrupt members of the Obama administration are cut from the same cloth and enrich their family’s finances from the Washington swamp. Hillary and Beijing Biden’s failed, socialist policies would increase taxes and provide fewer choices for hard-working Americans. That’s why Tennesseans resoundingly rejected Hillary at the ballot box in 2016 and will do the same for Beijing Biden in 2020. To read Bill's statement on Hillary's endorsement, visit our website HERE.

Team Hagerty celebrated a big victory last week as Bill Hagerty was elected the Republican nominee in the U.S. Senate race for Tennessee.

You can watch Team Hagerty's Election Night Watch Party in full HERE.
Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! We have another election to win in November. This time, it's not just sending Bill to the Senate, we must elect President Donald Trump for four more years and stand up to the radical liberals who want to pust America into a socialist state.
#TeamHagerty Is Strong
In his latest tweet supporting Bill's campaign, President Trump said that Team Hagerty is running an excellent campaign. We couldn't agree more, and it's because of all of the hard work and support of each of you. Team Hagerty released a new video last week highlighting the hard work of our team. Over the course of the campaign so far, we have made over two million personal voter contacts.
You can see some of these moments by watching the full video HERE.

Vote Team Hagerty
Over a year ago, Team Hagerty began the journey to send Bill Hagerty to the United States Senate to represent Tennesseans and fight for our conservative values. Since then, we have grown our momentum to a statewide grassroots movement. We are so proud of all the work that has been done, from knocking doors to making calls, each and every member of Team Hagerty has played a part in getting us where we are today. Now, on Election Day, we couldn't be more excited to get out to vote for Bill Hagerty and re-elect President Trump.
Watch our recap video HERE.
ICYMI: Boots & Jeans, BBQ & Beans
This weekend Team Hagerty joined Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson for his 14th Annual Boots & Jeans, BBQ & Beans. We were joined by some of the state's biggest conservative leaders like Governor Bill Lee, Senator Marsha Blackburn, Congressman Mark Green and Lt. Governor Randy McNally. Now more than ever, it is important that we get out and support Republicans up and down the ballot.
Election Day Is Here
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! It's not just about sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must re-elect President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for four more years and expand our Republican supermajority in Tennessee so we can continue to stand up to the radical liberals who want to make America a socialist country. There's still time to get out to vote, so head to the polls and make your voice heard!

Hagerty Releases Statement On Facebook
Read Bill's Statement on Facebook
Bill released a statement this morning on an explosive investigation revealing that Facebook employees were flagging and deleting posts in support of President Trump to undermine the 2020 presidential election. No social media platform should be the arbiter of what’s true and what’s not. In the Senate, Bill will continue to stand with President Trump and Senator Marsha Blackburn to ensure conservatives’ voices are protected from biased social media platforms. You can read Bill's full statement on our website HERE.

Bill's Blueprint To Protect The Right To Life
Bill released his latest editorial in the Jackson Sun last week. The op-ed reinforces Bill's position as 100 percent pro-life. The right to life is enshrined in our First Amendment, and Bill believes it is our Constitutional duty to be a voice for the voiceless. In the Senate, Bill will fight first and foremost to stop the taxpayer funding of abortions across the country, which begins with defunding big abortion businesses like Planned Parenthood once and for all. You can read the full editorial HERE and Bill's blueprint to protect the right to life HERE.

Join #TeamHagerty For Tonight's Presidential Debate
Joe Biden will finally leave his basement and answer real questions without using a teleprompter or pre-screened talking points. Tonight, the American people will have the opportunity to compare Biden's public record, nearly 50 years full of empty promises and failed policies, to President Donald Trump’s record over the last four years - a record of promises made and promises kept.
Follow along with Bill during tonight's debate HERE.
Confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett Now
Last week, President Donald Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill Justice Ginsberg's seat on the Supreme Court. Judge Barrett is a dedicated Christian public servant — a solid constitutionalist, who will steadfastly serve our nation. The Democrats are already attacking her faith - just think of what they’re capable of doing to our religious freedom. We must support President Trump and the Republican Senate Majority and confirm Judge Barrett now.
Read Hagerty's full statement on Judge Barrett's nomination HERE.
Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! We have another election to win in November. This time, it's not just sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must reelect President Donald Trump for four more years and expand our Republican supermajority in Tennessee so we can continue to stand up to the radical liberals who want to make America a socialist country.
Are You Registered To Vote?
Early voting begins in only 15 days! Make sure you're registered to vote and are ready to support President Trump and Team Hagerty in the election this November.

President Trump Is On #TeamHagerty
President Trump Endorses Bill Hagerty
Building on his endorsement, last week President Trump tweeted his support of Bill Hagerty's campaign for U.S. Senate for the second time. First, he tapped Bill to lead his Tennessee Victory team, then to help lead the Trump Transition Team in 2016. Then the President asked Bill to represent our great nation overseas as the U.S. Ambassador to Japan. President Trump gave Bill his complete and total endorsement before Bill announced his campaign, and then President Trump personally asked Bill to join his Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups to help re-open the American economy. Now, President Trump has endorsed Bill's campaign again because he knows Bill is the ally he needs in the Senate.
You can read Bill's statement about the President's continued support in the press release HERE.
Over 1,000 Local Leaders Are On #TeamHagerty
Team Hagerty announced over 1,000 endorsements from government officials, business leaders, law enforcement officers and community leaders across all 95 counties joined President Trump in endorsing Bill Hagerty for U.S. Senate last week. We are continuing to gain momentum every day, and we can't do it without you! To read the full release announcing this grassroots coalition of support, visit our website HERE.
Follow @BillHagertyTN On Parler
Bill Hagerty announced yesterday that he has joined the social media platform Parler. Social platforms like Twitter and Facebook are censoring and even silencing conservative voices and the coastal elites of Silicon Valley are relentless with their bias against conservative viewpoints. The radical Democrats leading these social media companies will continue to censor us until we think like liberals. That’s why Bill and Team Hagerty have joined Parler. Follow @BillHagertyTN for another great way to follow along and connect with Team Hagerty. You can read the release about this announcement HERE.
ICYMI: Majority Leader William Lamberth Is #TeamHagerty
William Lamberth is Team Hagerty
Majority Leader William Lamberth of Sumner County, Bill's home county, released an editorial in the Tennessee Star yesterday endorsing Bill's campaign to represent Tennessee in the U.S. Senate. We are so proud to have so many local leaders across the state supporting Team Hagerty. You can read the full editorial in support of Bill by clicking HERE.

President Trump Is All In On #TeamHagerty
President Donald J. Trump reminded Tennessee voters of the importance of sending Bill Hagerty to the United States Senate last week. This is the third time that President Trump has tweeted his support of Bill's campaign for Senate and we couldn't be more proud to have him on Team Hagerty. With endorsements from strong conservative leaders like the President, Vice President Mike Pence, Senator Marsha Blackburn, Congressman Chuck Fleischmann and Fox News host Sean Hannity, Team Hagerty has never been stronger.
Election Day Is Almost Here
Election Day for the Tennessee Republican Senate Primary is almost underway. #TeamHagerty is proud to have the support of Tennesseans, including over 1,000 local leaders in communities across the state. Make sure you get out to the polls and cast your ballot this THURSDAY to send Bill to the U.S. Senate.
You can find your polling location HERE.
We Are #TeamHagerty
In his latest tweet supporting Bill's campaign, President Trump said that Team Hagerty is running an excellent campaign. We couldn't agree more, and it's because of all of the hard work and support of each of you. Over the past year, we have had some incredible moments on the trail, connecting with Tennesseans across the state. You can see some of these moments by watching the video highlighting our strong grassroots support HERE.
WATCH: Sen. Blackburn Is #TeamHagerty
Senator Marsha Blackburn recently announced her endorsement of Bill Hagerty for the United States Senate. We couldn't be more grateful to have the support of the most conservative member of the Senate. Sen. Blackburn is a proven fighter for Tennesseans. When Bill gets to the Senate, he will continue working alongside Sen. Blackburn and President Trump to protect our conservative values. You can read the press release announcing Sen. Blackburn's endorsement HERE.
Diamond & Silk Are #TeamHagerty
Last week, at the Hamilton County Lincoln Day Dinner, conservative leaders, Diamond and Silk, endorsed Bill Hagerty for the U.S. Senate.
While speaking about their support for Bill, Diamond said, ""We need to make sure that we put people in these seats that are behind the President of the United States. Bill is one of them!""
You can watch the video of their endorsement HERE.
READ: Andy Holt Supports Bill Hagerty
Representative Andy Holt is a strong member of Team Hagerty and we are honored to have his support. In his latest editorial, Rep. Holt writes, ""I’ve known Bill for over almost a decade, and he has also earned my endorsement. Bill Hagerty is a Christian, a fine husband and father, a dedicated public servant, and a freedom-loving patriot. In the Senate, he will work tirelessly to defend our conservative values from those trying to undermine them.""

Early Voting Is Happening Now
Early voting is underway in Tennessee, and #TeamHagerty is ready to support Republicans up and down the ballot. Now more than ever, we must support candidates that will fight for our Tennessee conservative values. Bill is traveling across the state, listening to Tennesseans about what is important to them this election. It's freedom versus socialism on the ballot this November, and the choice is clear. We must re-elect President Donald Trump and vote Republican.
If you haven't already voted, you can find your nearest early voting location HERE.
ICYMI: Hagerty's Latest Editorial
President Trump has followed through on his promise to nominate strictly constitutionalists to the federal bench as a top priority. Since being sworn into office, President Trump and the Republican-led Senate have confirmed over 200 federal judges, which will have a long-lasting, positive impact on our future. Bill wholeheartedly supports Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a solid constitutionalist who will steadfastly serve our nation. In the Senate, Bill will continue to stand with President Trump and Senator Blackburn to confirm constitutional judges and justices who respect the Constitution and the rule of law.
Read Hagerty's latest editorial HERE.
Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! It's not just about sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must re-elect President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for four more years and expand our Republican supermajority in Tennessee so we can continue to stand up to the radical liberals who want to make America a socialist country.

Saturdays Should Be Game Days
Bill Hagerty released his latest editorial in the Knox News Sentinel last week calling for college football to come back this Fall. America needs football and sports now more than ever. We need a return to normalcy. We need something to bring us together. The sooner that our lives can return to a sense of normalcy, the sooner we can recover from the havoc this pandemic has wreaked.
You can read Bill's latest editorial in full HERE.
National Right To Life Is Team Hagerty
Last week, the National Right To Life Committee joined the Susan B. Anthony List in supporting Bill Hagerty for United States Senate. As a Christian conservative and a father of four children, Bill knows just how precious the right to life is. We are so proud to have yet another leader in the fight to protect the right to life join Team Hagerty.
You can read more about this announcement in the press release HERE.

Hagerty Has The Business Experience We Need
Team Hagerty released a digital video last week, highlighting Bill Hagerty’s economic experience. As a businessman and the former chief economic leader in Tennessee, Bill understands what turning around an economy takes. As our Senator, he will work to promote low taxes and a positive business environment in Tennessee and work with President Trump, Senator Blackburn and Tennessee’s Republican leadership to get our economy back on track and continue to expand our state's economy for years to come.
You can watch the full video HERE.
ICYMI: Bring Our Supply Chains Home
Last week, Bill released his latest editorial in Townhall. Under Bill’s leadership as Tennessee’s Commissioner of Economic and Community Development, tens of thousands of new jobs were created, lowering Tennessee’s unemployment rate from high above the national average to far below the national average. Bill understands what it takes to get our economy going again and that starts with bringing our supply chains back onshore.
Read the full editorial HERE.
Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! We have another election to win in November.

Bill's Blueprint To Hold China Accountable
Last week, Bill released his latest in a series of policy plans: Bill's Blueprint To Hold China Accountable. The Communist Chinese regime has an ongoing history of engaging in predatory business, military and diplomatic practices that endanger the United States and the rest of the world. As the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Bill witnessed first hand the threat that they posed. Now, the regime has unleashed and attempted to cover up a deadly virus that has caused great devastation to the physical and economic health of the entire globe. As our next Senator, Bill will continue working closely with President Trump as we prioritize holding China responsible for the greatest cover-up in human history and for their continued efforts to undermine our infrastructure and democracy. Read the full plan HERE.
Read: Bill's Op-Ed In Townhall
Bill's latest editorial, released in Townhall yesterday, calls for the Communist Chinese regime to be held accountable for their attempt to cover-up and hide valuable information related to the Wuhan coronavirus. Communist China poses an existential threat to the United States and for too long, they have been allowed to use predatory practices against the global community. Read Bill's most recent op-ed HERE.

Countdown To Early Voting
Early voting starts tomorrow, and #TeamHagerty is ready to support Republicans up and down the ballot. Bill is traveling across the state, from Memphis to Mountain City, listening to Tennesseans about what's important to us. Tennesseans want to send strong conservatives to Washington this November because conservative values are Tennessee values.
It's Time To Confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett
As the Senate holds hearings on Judge Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court, Bill Hagerty has been outspoken calling for the Republican Senate Majority to fill the seat. Judge Barrett is a principled constitutionalist who will interpret the law NOT make it. We need to confirm more constitutionalist judges and justices to the federal bench, and Bill will work to make sure that's the case.
Sign the petition confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett HERE.
Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! We have another election to win in November. This time, it's not just sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must reelect President Donald Trump for four more years and expand our Republican supermajority in Tennessee so we can continue to stand up to the radical liberals who want to make America a socialist country.

READ: Bill's Latest Op-Ed In TN Star
Bill Hagerty released his latest editorial in the TN Star last week calling out the Washington liberals seeking to bail out the reckless spending of local and state governments. Twice now, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have held American families, workers, and businesses hostage for days by delaying relief funding in the name of securing tens of millions of dollars for the Kennedy Center, pushing her Green New Deal, changing voting laws, and growing government to advance her radical socialist agenda. More recently, there have been calls to give handouts to failing state and local governments, not because of the coronavirus, but because these states have been mismanaged and run irresponsibly. The American taxpayer should not bail out state and local governments for the reckless fiscal decisions made before the coronavirus. Read Bill's latest editorial HERE.
ICYMI: DOJ Dropped Cases Against General Michael Flynn
After years of political harassment, General Michael Flynn, former National Security Advisor, has been exonerated. The criminal cases against General Flynn were dropped by the Department of Justice after an internal memo raised “serious questions about the nature of the investigation."" To read Bill's statement on the dropped criminal cases against General Michael Flynn, visit our website HERE.
Barack Obama, Joe Beijing Biden and their administration spied on President Donald Trump during their time in office. It's time to drain the swamp. Share this GIF on Twitter and Facebook if you agree.

ICYMI: Bill's Statement On Getting Back To School
Last week, Metro Nashville Public Schools announced that the start of the 2020-2021 school year would be through remote learning. In response, Bill released a statement calling for families who depend on schools for healthy meals, for a safe environment and for a great education to go back to the classroom this Fall. So often the American dream is laid with a good education. That's why Bill strongly believes it’s not when we get our children back in school – it’s how. He agrees with President Trump, it’s imperative that we open our schools safely this fall. Read Bill's full statement HERE.

ICYMI: We Must Support Farmers, Walking Horse Industry
Last week, Bill released his latest editorial in the Shelbyville Times-Gazette on the importance of protecting our farmers and the walking horse industry in our state. Our agriculture industry is an essential part of our economy, bringing in nearly $75 billion of revenue per year. The walking horse industry plays a vital role in Tennessee’s economy and agriculture. Having the center of the industry in Shelbyville means that it provides a huge boost to our state’s economy. As our next Senator, Bill will continue working closely with Tennesseans to support and protect our walking horse industry, support our agriculture industry and stimulate our state economy.
Read the full editorial HERE.
Looking To November

Beijing Biden

“The Communist Chinese Regime Is Responsible For The Crime Of The Century”
With the news reports indicating that the U.S. State Department warned about a research lab in Wuhan, China studying coronavirus in bats more than two years ago, Bill released a statement slamming the Communist Chinese regime. The new reports make it clear that Communist China prioritized a public relations campaign over a public health campaign - at the expense of the world’s health and economy.

Listen above as Bill talks about the President's plan to open American businesses again and get the economy going again.
ICYMI: Chinese Communist Regime’s Cover-up of the Coronavirus is the “Crime of the Century”
In his latest interview with Breitbart News, Bill calls for the Communist Chinese leadership and the World Health Organization (WHO) to be held accountable for COVID-19. China destroyed samples, silenced doctors and shut down air traffic within their country before shutting down international traffic, causing the virus to spread globally, while the WHO praised their transparency and handling of the health crisis. To listen to the interview and read more about China and the WHO's efforts to cover-up the impact of coronavirus, click HERE.
Beijing Biden
For years Joe Biden has been cozying up to the Communist Chinese leadership. In 2013, he secured his son, Hunter Biden, a position on the board of directors for a Chinese private-equity fund, where he continues to serve despite announcing his resignation in October 2019. Biden is a friend of Communist China. Click to share this graphic on Bill's Twitter and Facebook.

387,"""If Joe Biden were president, China would own the United States.""
Alex,
President Trump said it best:
“If Joe Biden were president, China would own the United States.”
We just released a new digital ad revealing #BeijingBiden's troubling track record of defending China.
Watch Our #BeijingBiden Ad
As President Donald Trump stands up to China and holds them accountable for the Wuhan virus, Beijing Biden has defended the Communist Chinese regime and even parroted their talking points.
Beijing Biden’s family's close economic ties to China are well known and his track record of defending China prove that he cannot credibly lead our nation.
In the Senate, I will continue to stand with President Trump to push back against the Communist regime’s propaganda and hold them accountable for what has become the crime of the century.
You can watch the ad here.
Thank you for your time.

#TeamHagerty supports President Donald Trump because he is fighting for the American people and will protect the conservative values held by Tennesseans across the state.

## Socialist Sanders Surges in Polls
Bernie Sanders Stands By Past Comments Defending Communist Cuban Leader Fidel Castro
If you are wondering whether or not this election matters, remember that Bernie Sanders is the front runner for the Democratic Party. Since the 1980s, Bernie has fought for socialist policies, and just this week, he defended Cuba's Communist regime. This support for communist, authoritarian regimes should trouble all Americans-- Democratic and Republican. Bill Hagerty will fight against the intrusion of socialism in America and will support President Donald Trump in his work to Keep America Great.

Richard Floyd: Bill Hagerty Will Stand With President Trump To Defend Our Unborn Children
I am supporting Bill Hagerty for U.S. Senate. As a Christian and a father of four, Bill understands how important it is to stand for life. Bill grew up with Tennessee values, and like so many of us, he truly values the sanctity of life. Bill always says, “abortion is not a human right; it takes a human life,” and he is exactly right. Bill will uphold his values and support legislation to strengthen protections for unborn children. He will also push to provide more options for mothers to turn to, such as crisis pregnancy centers, community groups, and faith outreach groups.
Sandy Still: Hagerty will support religious freedom
Bill Hagerty knows the attack on our religious freedoms is reprehensible and cannot be tolerated. He was raised with Christian conservative values and instilled those values on his four children. Bill, who is endorsed by President Trump, is running for the United States Senate in Tennessee to protect our religious freedoms.
Michael Tedder: In support of Hagerty’s U.S. Senate bid
If you think our health care system is broken now, just wait until the federal government takes over. And their Medicare-for-All plan is going to cost at least $32 trillion dollars, which would more than double our national debt. I believe this will destroy our country as we know it. Bill Hagerty is running for the United States Senate to combat the radical socialists and their agenda. I know Bill will stand with President Donald Trump to protect my conservative values and the conservative values of so many Tennesseans across the state.

ICYMI: Read Bill's Op-Ed in The Chattanoogan
Last week, Bill released an Op-Ed in the Chattanoogan addressing the serious issue of human trafficking in Tennessee and across the United States. Since 2007, in Tennessee, there have been 823 human trafficking cases reported, with 93 cases reported in 2019 alone. In his piece, Bill calls for a crackdown on websites and social media accounts that promote human trafficking, ensuring local agencies have the resources they need to educate our community on how to spot human trafficking and report it to law enforcement and violators to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law -- including the death penalty. Read Bill's full Op-Ed HERE.

Sandy Still: Hagerty will support religious freedom
As our next Senator, Bill will continue to stand with President Trump against radical liberals who seek to restrict our opportunities to speak about our faith and important values. President Trump and Bill Hagerty will faithfully stand for our Tennessee values and I proudly stand and support them.
Kenneth Eaton: As U.S. Senator, Hagerty would fight socialist agenda
The Democrats running for president would destroy our economy with their socialist takeover of our health care system. Their plan would cost trillions of dollars and take away the insurance you get at your job. That’s why it’s very important that we send a senator to Washington, D.C., who understands how dangerous this is and who will stop the Democrats’ extremely liberal agenda. I believe that representative is Bill Hagerty, a fiscal conservative running for the United States Senate who is endorsed by President Trump.
Mayor Dean Dickey: Why former Mayor Dean Dickey supports Bill Hagerty
In Tennessee, Bill Hagerty is the only U.S. Senate candidate that has been endorsed by President Trump. As President Trump’s former Ambassador to Japan, I know that Bill is ready to hit the ground running on Day 1 to stand with the President to fight back against the Democrats’ radical liberal agenda. He is not afraid to stand up to Nancy Pelosi, “The Squad” and RINOs like Mitt Romney. President Trump backs Bill Hagerty, and so do I.

Alex,
In the days since Trump ordered a drone strike on Qassem Soleimani, he has only exacerbated what was already a crisis.
Trump all but declared war on Twitter. He threatened to commit war crimes, vowing to target Iranian cultural heritage sites if Iran strikes back. He has no plan to deal with this disaster of his own making.
Ilhan is doing everything in her power to prevent another disastrous war. This week, she introduced a resolution to stop the military from taking action against Iran without congressional authorization.
Ilhan needs this grassroots movement behind her. She asked us to get 102 more signatures from Minneapolis to make sure Congress hears us loud and clear. Add your name to tell Congress: No war with Iran!

Thank you for speaking out for a more peaceful world,

Subject: Add your name: Congress must stop Trump from starting a war in Iran!
Alex,
Let this sink in: Donald Trump recklessly assassinated a foreign official and has no plan to deal with the consequences.
We don’t know for sure if he’ll start a war in Iran. But we do know that he wants war, knows his actions could spark war, and could use the distraction from his impeachment scandal.
It’s my constitutional duty to intervene when a president tries to overstep congressional authority. I will use the full power of my office to stop him — and I’m calling on my colleagues to do the same.
But we need every voice to rise up and demand that Congress stop Trump from recklessly starting an endless war. I need 92 people from Minneapolis to stand with me. Click here to be one of them.
Sign the petition
There’s no doubt that Qasem Soleimani was a violent, murderous man. But instead of exploring different approaches to the conflict, Trump ordered an airstrike without congressional approval.
We are currently engaged in a number of wars that have no end in sight. We can’t afford to enter another war that destabilizes regions, creates massive humanitarian crises, and further undermines our moral authority around the world.
Congress must step up and make sure this president’s reckless actions don’t get us into another war. I’m calling on you to be one of the 92 people from Minneapolis to demand that Congress hold Trump accountable.

Thank you for standing with me. Together, we’re going to bring peace around the world.

391,"Trump is riling up Islamophobes
Alex,
When the United States enters conflicts with Muslim-majority countries, it destabilizes nations and infringes upon human rights.
It also riles up Islamophobes and racists at home.
I've seen it on Twitter, where my calls to avoid a war with Iran were met with Islamophobic slurs and tropes in my replies. We've seen it at the U.S.-Canadian border, where dozens of Iranians and Iranian-Americans have been held for questioning for no reason at all.
From 2003 to 2007, we saw alarming rates of death threats, vandalism, and violence against Arab-Americans and others assumed to be of Middle Eastern heritage.
Violent rhetoric turns into violent acts.
Several of this president's hateful policies are rooted in Islamophobia. He's already empowered Islamophobes with the Muslim ban and his decision to accept the lowest amount of refugees in modern history. It will only get worse as he recklessly pushes us closer to an endless, unnecessary war with Iran.
Muslims should not have to keep living in fear of death threats and violent hate crimes simply because of their religion. Even as I make progress as one of the first Muslim Congresswomen, I face constant threats and hateful rhetoric.
The times we're in call for all of us to work harder to stamp out hate. If we stand together and speak truth to power, we can put Islamophobia in the dustbin of history where it belongs.

Alex,
Earlier this week, news broke that ICE has been forcefully sterilizing immigrants in detention centers — a hallmark of genocide that’s internationally recognized by the United Nations as a crime against humanity.
Time and time again, ICE has proven to be a cruel, unaccountable agency, rooted in racism, sexism, and a reckless disregard for the safety and well-being of immigrants and refugees. On top of the chilling allegations of mass hysterectomies, ICE has a well documented track record of abuse, neglect, and misconduct from guards sexually assaulting and harassing detainees to employees refusing to test and treat detainees with COVID-19. There must be a full reckoning with the torture and cruelty this administration has caused immigrants — and that starts with abolishing ICE.
Will you join the movement to abolish ICE right now by adding your name next to mine?
I SUPPORT ABOLISHING ICE
Since the Bush administration founded ICE in 2002, ICE has established itself as an agency designed to hurt, dehumanize, and terrorize immigrant and refugee communities. It has only become increasingly militarized and unaccountable over the years, and the movement to abolish it is grounded in the goal of creating an immigration system based on humanity and compassion. As the pandemic only exacerbates the unsafe conditions in ICE detention centers, it’s clearer than ever that the time to completely dismantle ICE is now.
ICE has proven itself to be beyond reform. Add your name right now to support the Abolish ICE movement.
Thank you for speaking out.

# Qualls Files for Congress
## First in Line and First to File with Minnesota Secretary of State
Plymouth, Minnesota – Kendall Qualls, endorsed Republican candidate for Congress in Minnesota’s Third Congressional District, today officially filed for office with the Minnesota Secretary of State. Qualls will face first term Democratic incumbent Dean Phillips in the November general election.
“While our campaign has been going full speed since entering the race last August, today makes it official,” said Qualls. “I wanted to be the first in line and first to file today to show the residents of the Third District that I’m ready to put my business turnaround and healthcare experience to work for them on day one,” stated Qualls.
Qualls, a U.S. Army Veteran and newcomer to politics, was overwhelmingly endorsed by Third District Republicans on April 30. The only one in his family to attend college, he grew up in the crime ridden ghetto of Harlem, NY, before upgrading to a trailer park in Oklahoma. After his Army service, he worked for Fortune 100 companies in the healthcare industry, including Johnson & Johnson, Roche Labs and Medtronic/Covidien. He now works for a small healthcare startup that helps cancer patients tackle their disease.
“Over the course of my life, I’ve been called many things–ghetto kid, trailer trash, veteran, businessman, husband, father–but I never dreamed I’d be called candidate for U.S. Congress,” said Qualls. “As your congressman, I’ll dedicate my efforts to moving people toward a goal that is larger than each individual and transcends racial, economic and gender differences. And in doing so, we’ll build bridges that will make America better, stronger and more united than ever before,” Qualls concluded.

# We Must Promote Two-Parent Families to Heal our Wounds
As the Twin Cities and our leaders look to rebuild, consider needed reforms in policing, and pursue justice for George Floyd, the enduring question is how to address the consistent disparities between African-Americans and other ethnic groups. It is time we address an uncomfortable truth. The chief barrier to the advancement of the African-American community is the rise of single parent households - not racism, police brutality, or white privilege.
Our country will not meaningfully resolve the significant economic, health, and educational disparities between black Americans and other groups until we address the single parent household crisis plaguing the African-American community.
We can do this through legislation, community engagement, and by shifting values in the African-American community to emphasize two-parent families.
The Dramatic Rise of Births Outside of Marriage in the African-American Community
The detrimental impact on children of their parents not being married was first described over fifty years ago in the Moynihan Report. The Moynihan Report concluded that in a majority-black community, the main predictor in growing up poor was not race but being born to parents who were not married.[1]
The single parent crisis has only worsened since the Moynihan report was issued: the black community has experienced almost a tripling of unmarried births. In 1965, 25 percent of child births in the black community occurred outside of marriage.[2] Today, it is 69.4 percent: 68 percent in urban areas 79 percent in rural areas.[3]
Children Born to Unmarried Couples are Less Likely to Succeed
Children born to unmarried couples are less likely to succeed educationally, emotionally, and financially.[4] Children born in single-parent homes are more likely to have contact with the criminal justice system, resent authority, join a gang, and have substance abuse issues. They are also more likely to suffer from mental health issues, obesity, poverty, homelessness, and child abuse. The effects are multigenerational: less-educated parents are less likely to marry and it begins a cycle of entrapment in the underclass.[5]
I don’t need the data to tell me this. I’ve seen it firsthand in my own family.
My Firsthand Experience with the Single-Parent Crisis
I was born in 1963, the year before Lyndon B. Johnson began the war on poverty with a series of well-intended government programs. In 1968, my father returned from the Vietnam War and my parents divorced. My mother moved my four siblings and me from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where my father was stationed, to live with my grandparents in Harlem. On our first day there, we were robbed on our way to my grandparent’s apartment – it was the middle of the day and there were no police officers in sight (that is the reality when police officers are “removed” from the community).
There was a common theme in the public-housing project that we lived in and the school I attended: there were mothers and children, but an absence of fathers. The only men in the neighborhood were drunks, drug addicts, or drug-dealers. For three years, that was my world. I saw the stressful and worried look on my mother’s face every night when it was time for bed. New York City never sleeps and in Harlem the screams, crime, and violence never seemed to end. My mother, despite her best efforts, could not raise all five us in that environment. My father came to Harlem and retrieved my brother and me to live with him in Oklahoma.
I am younger than all of my siblings and cousins. Between my age and the geographic divide, which resulted in semi-regular visits back east, I was able to watch them over the decades and see how their fatherless existence and personal decisions impacted their lives. The outcomes were similar to what is emblematic in the African-American community: poverty, crime, drug addiction, and joblessness. Most did not marry and they had kids outside of marriage. If they did marry, the marriages were short-lived and ended in divorce.
Of my four siblings, three went to prison. All four used drugs. One became addicted to heroin and contracted HIV/AIDS from intravenous drug use. He later died from complications related to AIDS. Sadly, my nieces and nephews followed a similar path: high school dropouts, drugs, joblessness, and dependency. Last year, my 42-year-old niece died from a drug overdose.
How to Address the Single Parent Crisis
The story of my extended family is emblematic of the crisis plaguing the African-American community. America has made significant strides in combating racism. However, the African-American community is mired in self-inflicted wounds and a mindset of victimization. The Democratic policies of the last fifty years have only exacerbated the issue.
We can address the crisis through legislation, community engagement, and by shifting values in the African-American community to emphasize two-parent families.
* Federal legislation to remove the marriage penalty in government programs and provide a tax deduction for those who complete marriage preparation.
* Support and promote nonprofits that include education on the value of marriage and the negative impact father absence has on children and the community.
* Partner with schools, community leaders, and Black churches to extol the values of marriage for children and for married couples.
We Must Acknowledge & Address the Single Parent Crisis in Order to Heal
Given the dramatic rise of births outside of marriage, it is no surprise that we continue to see the African-American community underperform and disproportionally suffer from incarceration, violence, and interactions with the police. This is no excuse for brutality and we must pursue policing reform. But we must also examine the hardened realities of police officers before we castigate the entire group for the actions of a few, let alone abolish police forces entirely.
The flashpoint of the last several weeks does not have to be a repeat of the flameout in 1968, 1992, or 2014. Instead, we should turn George Floyd’s tragic death to a re-examination of the single parent crisis in the African-American community and the government polices enabling men to abandon their responsibilities. As Barack Obama rightly declared, the “hole a man leaves when he abandons his responsibility to his children is one that no government can fill.”
Let us remember this lesson as we seek to rise up from the ashes of Lake Street, pursue policing reform, and rebuild our community. In doing so, we must candidly discuss how the single parent crisis that reverberates across America hurts us all, whether we acknowledge it or not.

# America the Exceptional: My Response to Dean Phillips and his Vision of America as Systemically Racist
Kendall's opponent, first-term Democratic Congressman Dean Phillips, has attempted to convey the Black-American experience and redefine America in the process. On June 22, Dean Phillips emailed his supporters and stated that ""Racism is deeply [[URL REDACTED]] our institutions, and in our everyday lives."" On June 23, he posted a message on Facebook to reiterate that message. He also created a ""resource guide"" on his website for ""racial justice allyship"" to “understand our nation’s” black experience and combat ""systemic racism"" in America.
Kendall Qualls, as a Black-American descended from slaves, takes umbrage with Dean’s characterization of America as a systemically racist country. In its place, Kendall offers a vision of hope because ""America is an exceptional place full of exceptional people” with opportunity for all. Kendall’s full response to Dean is below.
Kendall Qualls – In response to my opponent, Dean Phillips, and his attempt to convey the Black experience and redefine America in the process, I’m going to tell you what it’s really like to be a Black man in America.
My opponent’s virtue signaling insults me, and it should insult you too. Dean Phillips got his degree in Urban Studies from an Ivy League School in the Northeast. I got my degree in Urban Studies from the streets of Harlem in New York City.
Yet, unlike him, I’m not going to lecture you on the evils of white people, or guilt you into believing that “white privilege” makes you personally responsible for slavery and the struggles Black people face today.
I’m not going to lecture you like he did by telling you “racism is deeply ingrained in our history, in our institutions, and in our everyday lives, and white people [like you] have benefited from it.” I’m not going to lecture you from a place of privilege as the third wealthiest member of the House of Representatives and tell you racial justice will only be achieved if you “forgo” your comfort and take the blame as a white person.
I’m also not going to sit idly by as statues topple, and they tell you our history needs to be erased or rewritten. Why? Because I don’t believe it.
Like you, I know the overwhelming majority of white people aren’t racist. But as a Black man I am going to tell you that if you look for racism in America you will find it. At the same time, if you look for opportunity in America you will find it tenfold.
I am also going to tell you that in spite of spending part of my childhood in a crime and drug-infested housing project in Harlem, in spite of spending the other part in a trailer park in rural Oklahoma, and in spite of having to work nights and weekends to put myself through school, I made it.
I made it because America is an exceptional place full of exceptional people. And there are millions more just like me who made it – white, black, brown, and everything in between.
However, my opponent and his progressive comrades across the nation are using the tragic death of George Floyd to fuel the flames of racism and create a smoke screen to cover up how they failed our cities, our country, and the Black community.
When I was in high school, I remember big city politicians and urban elites calling America racist because Black-Americans struggled in the inner cities. Not much has changed. Black-Americans still struggle, the same urban elites dominate the conversation, and yet they present no fundamental plan for change. Empty platitudes and a reading list for white people won’t solve the struggles in the Black community.
Those on the left tell us “we have to have the tough conversations” about race. I agree. Let’s have the “tough conversations” by looking at the real barriers to progress:
* Progressive politicians and urban elites that want to shift accountability from the failed programs they’ve championed and benefited from the past 50 years.
* The destruction of two-parent Black families through social programs that discourage marriage and result in generational welfare.
* Policies that limit educational opportunities, prohibit school choice, and protect teachers' unions, preventing prosperity in the process.
This story isn’t being told in the halls of Congress but, rest assured, I won’t be afraid to speak truth to power. I won’t be afraid to “have the hard conversations.”
This election is about our country’s direction. We must fight the ideology of destruction and those who promote the vision of America as a systemically racist country. We must fight those who enable and spread this vision, paving the way for mob rule in the process.
My opponent can independently fund his political campaign from his trust fund. In fact, he already has. Do I begrudge him for his wealth? No, because this is America and everyone has a right to pursue prosperity and happiness. But I do take umbrage of his characterization of America given all that this country has given me and my family.
I’m not afraid to tell you that life isn’t fair. Like all countries, America has its imperfections. But with faith and hard work, you have the freedom in this country to overcome your circumstances and build a better life. I’m proof of it. I want to protect the freedom that allowed my opponent’s family to prosper, allowed me and my family to improve our lot in life, and make sure that freedom is here so you and your family can prosper too.
Today, we have a unique opportunity to put forth a model for racial healing and economic prosperity for all. The truth is when Black Americans prosper, we all prosper. But we will not get there by destroying monuments to abolitionists, removing pictures of Abraham Lincoln from the Minnesota House Chamber, or defunding police in the communities that need it most.
Instead, we must take action – in Minnesota and across our nation. We must speak up, protect our history, and promote principled solutions to heal our nation.
If we don’t, who will?

<<First Name,>>
We are facing a challenging time. With only a few days to go and early voting starts in the Tennessee Primary, the country’s calls for Criminal Justice reform grow louder & louder.
A central piece of our campaign is to abolish the inequities in our environment, justice, health care, and education system to strengthen our democracy.
The best way to fundamentally change our way of life is through restorative justice. Restorative Justice focuses on the harm caused by crime and, ultimately, the healing of all parties involved. It focuses on transformative alternatives. Our current structure only increases recidivism and benefits the for-profit prison system. We must ensure that everyone stands equal before the law and rehabilitate offenders. We must stop the school-to-prison pipeline.
####
Our campaign is focused on a win for The People–not for the large businesses or established power in Tennessee that exploit our systems. Now is our opportunity to make justice available to everyone, no matter the zip code. Furthermore, we can’t do it without your support. Every one of your contributions is making a meaningful difference. Can we count on you?
We will win together!
Onwards!

An Important Note From Marquita Bradshaw:
* * *
My spirit moved by seeing this hashtag #WeAreDoneDying. The mother of 25-year-old Ahmaud Aubrey will not have her child this Mother's Day. This was a hate crime with gun violence. One is too many when it comes to innocent blood. The false sense of privilege fueled by racism that spills innocent blood will only stop when we elect leadership that design policies to protect black, brown, and red bodies from the structural racism.
We have to participate in making this democracy reflective of our shared values by voting, engaging others to vote, and holding our three branches of government accountable. #WeAreDoneDying translates for me- I'm done chasing the symptoms of racism, gun violence, health disparities, poverty, over-incarceration, subpar education, environment degradation, addiction, lack of healthcare, lack of mental health services, and lack of equity. The strategy to be a better America is to publicly demonstrate, litigate in the courts, engage in all aspects of the political process.

# Sussex County Sheriff Mike Strada endorses Frank Pallotta for Congress
Sussex County Sheriff Mike Strada endorsed Frank Pallotta for Congress today. Sheriff Strada won re-election 68 percent to 32 percent in the Republican primary and with 94 percent in the General Election.
“I am endorsing Frank Pallotta today for Congress in the Fifth District,” Strada said. “Frank Pallotta stood with Sussex County and stood with me against the Murphy administration’s attempts to do away with effective border controls.”
“The battle we fought last year, on behalf of the people of Sussex County, has been proved right by the deadly virus we are now facing. Border controls are vital to the safety of our nation, our communities, and our families. Frank Pallotta stepped up and stood with us when we needed help. As a member of Congress, I know he will step up and fight for Sussex County and all the communities of the Fifth Congressional District.”
Frank Pallotta paid tribute to the service of Sheriff Strada: “Mike Strada is fighter and a leader. As a platoon leader in Iraq, as a police officer fighting crime, and as an elected County Sheriff keeping residents of the district safe, Mike Strada has shown he has what it takes and I thank him so very much for his support. It is an honor.”
New Jersey’s Fifth Congressional District includes parts of Bergen, Sussex, Passaic, and Warren Counties.

Dear Joe,
You’re only twelve. Your stutter is debilitating. It embarrasses you, and the bullies are vicious.
But listen to Mom when she says, “bravery resides in every heart” — and yours is fierce and clear. Listen to Dad when he says, “we get knocked down, and then we get right back up.”
Because if you listen, you’ll summon the bravery to overcome the stutter and stand up to the bullies.
You’ll learn from Dad who moved the family to look for work — that a job is a lot more than a paycheck; it’s about dignity and respect.
You’ll learn from him that the cardinal sin is the abuse of power — and you have an obligation to fight the abuse whenever you see it.
And that’s why you’ll follow your heart to serve your community, state, and your country.
An intolerance for the abuse of power will drive you to stand up for civil rights, end the scourge of violence against women, confront corporations polluting the environment, and fight crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing around the world.
And because you listened, you’ll live a life fully consistent with what you were taught by Mom and Dad and your faith.
That you should say what you mean and mean what you say.
That we cannot serve ourselves at the expense of others.
Leading by the power of example will define you, and one day, find yourself forging a relationship with a Jesuit Pope who embodies that universal truth.
But you’ll also learn early — and later — in life that reality has a way of intruding.
One day you’re on top of the world, only to be brought down in a flash with a profound loss and grief that leaves a black hole in your heart, questions of faith in your soul, and an anger beyond rage.
That’s when you’ll have to dig deep and live what Mom taught you — that out of everything terrible that happens, something good will come if you look hard enough.
You’ll hold on with faith and pure grit.
You’ll be blessed with a love that will anchor you as deeply as your faith.
Your bond with your children and grandchildren will be your redemption.
Your ties with your sister and brothers will hold you tighter together.
Because of a family grounded in unconditional love and loyalty, and the compassion of friends and strangers, you’ll not only get help.
You’ll get up. You’ll keep going. You’ll give back in kind.
You’ll realize that countless people have suffered equally or more, but with much less support and much less reason to want to get through it.
But they too get up. They too keep going. As you will.
You’ll learn what it means to be an American. There’s no quit in America.
You’ll learn that happiness and success in life is an accumulation of a thousand little things built on the character of who we are as Americans.
A country where no one is better than you, and everyone is your equal — regardless of who they are, what they do, where they come from, or who they love.
You’ll learn that it’s about being personal. Being there for family and friends. Serving your country.
Building real relationships, even with people with whom you vehemently disagree.
That’s America — made up of ordinary people, like you, doing extraordinary things.
And one day when you graduate from law school, you’ll decide to become a public defender.
In the midst of the epic struggle for civil rights, you’ll be walking the streets on the east side of Wilmington, much of which has been burned to the ground after your heroes were assassinated.
Forty years later, you’ll stand on a train platform overlooking the east side. Wilmington and the nation are no longer aflame, but awaiting a new ripple of hope.
You’ll be waiting for a young black man, inspired by the dream of a King, coming from Philadelphia to pick you up and take you on a 124-mile trip to Washington to be sworn in as President and Vice President of the United States.
Together, you’ll prove that change is hard but necessary; progress is never easy but always possible; and things do get better on our march toward that more perfect union.
That’s the history of the journey of America.
And believe it or not, because you listened to Mom and Dad, you’ll help write it.
Keep the faith, Joey.
Thanks for reading this letter all the way to the end. It's a powerful reminder that as Americans, there is nothing that we cannot overcome, especially when we stand together.
We hope you feel like you know Joe Biden a little bit better today.

BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT NEWSLETTER
Below is Joe Biden’s newsletter for August 23, 2020. Please submit questions and feedback here.
Folks,
What an incredible August it has been for this campaign.
I announced Kamala Harris as my running mate, we held a one-of-a-kind Democratic National Convention all across America, and on Thursday I accepted your nomination for President of the United States.
The last few weeks have been inspiring and humbling. Getting to hear from people across the country -- friends, family, and so many other folks -- about why they’re supporting me and this campaign for the presidency is something I’ll never forget.
I’ll be frank with you: these next 72 days won’t be easy. But when I need strength, I’ll think back to this week. And I hope you will too.
I’m excited to share in this newsletter all of what the campaign has been doing in August, but for now, I’ll leave you with a line I quoted in my convention speech on Thursday from Ella Baker, a giant of the civil rights movement:
“Give people light and they will find a way.”
I give you my word: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. I will be an ally of the light, not of the darkness.
Now is the time for us to come together, to choose hope over fear, to give people the light.
Let's get to work.
Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Kamala Harris, Doug Emhoff
Campaign Updates
I couldn’t possibly sum up everything that was said over the four days of the Democratic National Convention and everything else this campaign has been up to without making this email too long, so I’m excited to share just a few highlights with you.

When I first met Brayden on the campaign trail, I saw a familiar anxiety on his face. It was the anxiety of a kid with a stutter, something I struggled to overcome when I was a kid, too. I told him then that we can’t let the barriers in our life define us, and he took that message to heart. I’m proud to be a part of his story, and of the courage this remarkable young man had to share his story with the world on the last night of the convention. Click below to watch his speech:

Having my friend Jacquelyn nominate me for President of the United States meant the world to me. I’m so glad we got to share that elevator ride together, and that you were brave enough to say you supported me when so many were ready to count this campaign out. Jacquelyn, I hope you know -- we love you back.
Watch Jacquelyn nominate Joe Biden for President
And this campaign has been doing even more than just holding a historic convention.
Earlier this month, I announced my Agenda for the Latino Community. As president, I’ll invest in Latinos’ economic mobility, make far-reaching investments in ending health disparities by race, expand access to high-quality education, and tackle racial inequity in our education system. I’ll combat hate crimes and gun violence, and secure our values as a nation of immigrants. You can read my full plan by clicking on the images below:

And we made history in another way this month -- with the largest ad buy ever made by a general election presidential candidate. My team is planning to spend $280 million to advertise in battleground states online, on TV, and anywhere else we can reach voters.
But here’s the truth: we still have to keep fundraising to make sure we can afford to run these ads and fund our critical organizing work.
That’s why I have to ask: can you make your first donation to power our campaign to victory in November?

What’s Coming
Starting tomorrow, Donald Trump will hold the Republican National Convention. If I’m being honest, I hope you won’t spend too much time watching it -- their week is sure to be dark and divisive, and there is so much organizing work to be done on our end instead.
So here’s my ask: Will you do one extra thing this week to make sure Democrats up and down the ballot win in November? Whether it’s talking with friends and family, making calls with my campaign, or making your plan to vote, everything you do today counts. Here’s one of my favorite options:
Text Vote to 30330
We only have 72 days left in this election, and every single one of those days matters.
My campaign is hosting virtual events, running our advertising programs, and implementing massive organizing plans across the country. And I’m so glad you’re a part of it.
But running such an ambitious, historic campaign means we also have to set ambitious, historic fundraising goals. And since this is a grassroots campaign, we rely on supporters like you to reach them. That’s why I’m asking, one more time:
Will you chip in right now to power my campaign? Any amount you’re able to give will make a real difference.

I could keep reminiscing about these past few weeks for a lot longer, but that won’t help us win votes in November, so it’s time for me to wrap up.
But I hope you feel as energized and hopeful as I do right now -- for this campaign, and for our country’s future.
This is our moment to decide who we are as Americans. And I know that with you by my side, we can win this battle for the soul of the nation.
So for now -- keep the faith, and keep up the fight. We can do this.

We understand this is a challenging time, so please only donate if you can. Most importantly, take care of yourself and your loved ones during this difficult period in our nation's history.
Meet Dr. Cameron Webb, one of our NewDem Frontier candidates who is running to flip Virginia’s 5th district blue in November.
Service and hard work are in Cameron’s blood - his mother worked in a public school and his father worked as a law enforcement official in the Drug Enforcement Administration. Cameron took these values to heart, first as a fellow in the Obama Administration, and now as a practicing physician.
That’s a record of service to be proud of. And his right-wing Republican opponent Bob Good knows it.
Dr. Webb will be the first Black doctor elected to Congress. And Bob Good knows that Cameron has momentum in this race. That's why he started a smear campaign. He’s out with an ad that tells voters to “look past [his] smooth presentation” and tries to connect him with rioting and crime.
I’ll be blunt - this ad is racist and it has no place in our politics. That's why I'm asking our supporters to kick in for Dr. Webb today and help him fight back.
But these racist lies won’t scare Cameron. He’s firing back with an ad that sets the record straight and highlights his support from the law enforcement community. Now he needs to make sure he has the resources to keep it on the air. Will you chip in to help Cameron spread his message and stop the Republican lies?
Fear-mongering has no place in politics. Will you chip in to show that you stand with Cameron against this hateful smear campaign?
Cameron can win this and make history as the first Black doctor elected to Congress. He’s ready to get to work. Chip in now to ensure he has the resources to set the record straight and make sure this race is fair and honest.

Alex,
I'd like to tell you a story about Jon that you may not know. Nearly three years ago, I began doing some work in the community to stop domestic violence. A woman and her four-year old child had been murdered by her ex-boyfriend, who then killed himself. The case made an imprint on me. A mother and her child were dead. There was a vigil and some media coverage of the deaths, but nobody seemed to be asking many questions.
I had been prosecuting domestic violence cases for about four years at that time and believed more could be done in the community to stop interpersonal violence. I began meeting with experts in the field in Kalamazoo and throughout Michigan, learning about the role that trauma, and witnessing or experiencing violence as a child has on people who go on to become abusive themselves. I learned that suffering trauma is the leading indicator that a person will hurt someone else.
First, we wrestled with the question of which action or set of actions to take to create real change in the community. We knew that trauma contributed significantly to interpersonal violence in the community, but we weren't sure how to address it. After much discussion, the answer came in the form of a new treatment court - a court that treated trauma as a root cause of crime and family violence. Just as Drug Courts treat addiction to reduce crime and recidivism, this court program would treat trauma to reduce violence perpetration. The concept became known as the Kalamazoo County Trauma & Resiliency Court, a first of its kind endeavor in our country.
Next, we were faced with the question of where to turn to provide funding for trauma survivors and their families. Treatment for trauma survivors would help reduce interpersonal violence in the community, but as we all know, treatment costs money. And trauma survivors often lack the resources to pay for quality treatment out of pocket. Particularly, the kind of treatment that effectively calms trauma reactivity and heals families in the process.
Jon Hoadley answered the call. I met with Jon to discuss our efforts and he immediately offered to help. He fought for, and won, funding in the state legislature to create the new treatment court program in Kalamazoo County.
The Trauma & Resiliency Court program will fundamentally change the way we understand and treat trauma survivors in the community, offering survivors help and healing, instead of more pain and punishment. It will mean fewer trauma victims and more resilience in and through the justice system.
I want you to know the critical role Jon played in helping trauma survivors in this community. Nobody has ever done anything like this anywhere in the country or, so far as I know, the world. Unfortunately, the voices of trauma survivors are often ignored in the criminal justice system, as this survivor details in this piece. They repeatedly ask for more resources to treat and heal trauma, but are instead given pain and punishment. Jon is helping to end this injustice in Kalamazoo and bend the arc just a little more.
This is yet one more reason to support Jon Hoadley with your time and money. Jon is doing more for trauma survivors in this community than Upton ever has or ever will. He is quietly, but fundamentally, changing the way we view and treat survivors in the justice system.
I hope you’ll join me in supporting Jon’s campaign.
In politics these days, we too often see the mean and the ugly, the distortion of truth, hurtful words and misdeeds that have come to define the Trump era. Upton, through the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), benefits from this kind of politics.
Jon is different. Jon cares about people. Jon cares about this community. He's fighting for Kalamazoo in Lansing each and every day, and will do the same in Washington, D.C. when we send him to Congress this November. Let's help him get there.
I know this was a long email. If you've gotten to this line, thank you. Let's give Jon the best thanks we can in the coming weeks by voting to retire Upton.
Sincerely yours,
Joe

Alex --
Right now, we are in a cycle of escalation with Iran, with every moment carrying the potential to draw us into a wider war.
Our nation is at the brink of war, but our Commander in Chief has not provided a comprehensive plan or course of action. In a matter of 24 hours, he’s flipped from threatening to bomb cultural sites in Iran (a move that both Democrats and Republicans condemn as a war crime) to echoing Obama’s previous Iran strategy to avoid another war.
Trump’s yo-yo foreign policy is evidence that his administration does not have a solid strategy in place and that he is willing to put American lives at risk in the process to formulate a clear plan. In fact, several Democrats and Republicans were unimpressed by Trump’s briefing this week, with one Republican calling the briefing “insulting” and “probably the worst briefing I’ve seen, at least on a military issue…”
It’s time for Congress to stand up and carry out their duty under the Constitution. We must hold Congress accountable to prevent another endless war that puts American lives at risk and will cost billions of taxpayer dollars.
West Michigan -- and the country -- deserve leaders who understand the gravity of their actions and take their responsibilities seriously. We do not, and will not, tolerate leaders who carelessly make threats with no clear strategy behind their decisions.
Please add your name below to send a clear message to Congress, demanding our leaders form a clear, comprehensive strategy to de-escalate the situation in Iran and to stop Trump from further politically-motivated actions of war without authorization from Congress.

Friends,
It's no secret that my opponent values money and personal connections more than the well-being of his constituents -- but this article that appeared in The Post and Courier last week ([[URL REDACTED]]) gives us insight into just how bad it is.
Last year, William Timmons nominated George K. Lyall, a family friend of his, to be a judge in South Carolina's magistrate court. Nominating family friends for important judicial positions is questionable enough as is, but Lyall's nomination is particularly egregious. In the 1990s, Lyall pled guilty to stealing nearly $100,000 from accounts he managed.
George Lyall is a criminal guilty of stealing tens of thousands of dollars, and he's now putting low-income South Carolinians in prison when they can't afford to pay traffic tickets. Asked about Lyall's past, Timmons said that ""even with that, you’re not going to find somebody with more experience in the courtroom"".
Lyall's nomination is not only a reflection of how corrupt Timmons is, but it also a reflection of how broken our criminal justice system is. Poverty is treated like a crime, and wealthy white criminals like Lyall can steal $100k and face virtually no repercussions.
If you weren't already convinced, I hope this shows you just how critical next year's election will be. Big corporations and groups like the NRA continue to fund Timmons' campaign, but I'm relying entirely on you all.
Can you rush a donation now to help me beat Timmons and turn SC-04 blue? ([[URL REDACTED]])

[[URL REDACTED]]
Friend,
If you’re wondering what’s being done about violent ANTIFA rioters and the crimes they’re committing by assaulting police officers, looting small businesses, and burning cities across America, the answer is not enough.
When these radical rioters are rightfully arrested for their crimes, left-wing prosecutors release them from jail and allow them to wreak more havoc in the streets. This is not only dangerous to thousands of innocent citizens residing in American cities -- it’s eroding a sense of personal responsibility.
What makes it even worse is that violent ANTIFA rioters who have been arrested and convicted of crimes are still eligible for unemployment benefits set aside for those impacted by COVID-19.
You read that right: the very same dangerous convicted rioters who are burning down small businesses are stealing the money those business owners need to rebuild after the pandemic.
I’m leading the fight in Congress to STOP this and prohibit anyone who is convicted of looting or other violent protest-related crimes ineligible to receive coronavirus unemployment benefits.
I’ve made it clear where I stand on this friend, but I want to know what you think. Will you take a quick minute to take our CRITICAL survey and share your thoughts?
Should convicted rioters be eligible for unemployment benefits?

Friends,
There’s a lot of people in Washington that are afraid to stand up to the mob -- but Rep. Jim Banks is not one of them.
Let me cut to the chase -- the mob wants Joe Biden to be president because they know he’ll let them get away with anything. Right now, Washington Democrats are 100% focused on lining the pockets of the ANTIFA thugs destroying our cities.
That’s why my father needs strong representatives like Jim Banks in Washington. Jim is standing strong and immediately halting all taxpayer money from going to the violent members of ANTIFA who have been arrested and convicted. Jim is leading the charge in Congress to prohibit anyone who participated in violence or looting during protests from receiving any coronavirus aid.
Jim is exactly what we need in Washington. He’s a veteran, father, proud Hoosier, and strong supporter of our President. He’s fighting to hold the ANTIFA mob accountable and stop the destruction of our cities.
I’m fighting to send Jim back to Washington, but I need your help. Jim is fighting hard to STOP the mob, so will you join me in fighting for our values and Jim?

GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT OR INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN REPUBLICAN
Nancy Pelosi has officially ordered articles of impeachment. While the House Democrats reveal that there is no proof or evidence, House Democrats continue to show facts and evidence don't matter- they will proceed. In their view, You are guilty until proven innocent, or innocent until proven Republican.
The liberals focus on the impeachment of President Trump and neglect their real work that our elected officials -like Jared Golden- are expected to do, is the real crime. While President Trump continues the work to pass UMSCA, build the wall, lower our taxes, fight the opioid crisis, and promote business growth, the Democrats would rather betray voters who elected them and play political games.
We don’t have time to play games. These articles provide Democrats like Jared Golden with is a funding stream to continue to pushback on President Trump.

For Immediate Release
December 18th, 2019
Contact: Jonathan Moynahan; [[URL REDACTED]]
Dale Crafts Statement on Congressman Jared Golden’s Impeachment Vote:
""Make no mistake, Jared Golden’s vote today was a betrayal on not only Maine’s second district, but also on our Country. His vote was nothing more than a weaponized protest vote. Since September the House Democrats, including Jared Golden have held their elected offices hostage to the work of the American people. This historic, political, and partisan betrayal vote is a rebuke of all the successful accomplishments President Trump has worked so hard to achieve in just 3 years. While President Trump has continually worked to improve the country (by, bringing in roughly 4 million jobs, lifting 3.9 million Americans off of food stamps, signing right to try legislation, working to secure our borders, and awaiting to sign the USMCA; which would have a significant positive impact on Maine farmers) the Democratic party has been fixated on impeachment since the election of 2016.
Jared Goden stated that President Trump ""abused his power."" The real abuse of power was being a complicit accomplice to Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler’s process of this impeachment inquiry. The other abuse of power is firing an impeachment vote at a duly elected President for crimes that no evidence can sustain. Out of all the witnesses that were paraded in front of the house committees, not one could provide first hand knowledge of what took place, only hearsay and circumstantial evidence.
I had hoped that Jared Golden would choose to vote with his constituency and not be strong-armed by his own party. We need representation that will not bend to the wishes of their party and do what is right. Being in a wheelchair for 36 years and a businessman all my life, I can confidently tell you, “No one will ever strong-arm Dale Crafts.” Throughout my business career, I have learned to negotiate and work with different opinions in difficult situations to provide the best possible outcome. I have developed a lot of skills and negotiation is one of my strongest. This is a skill I believe Jared Golden and many others in Washington do not have.
Mainer’s deserve more from our elected officials, and as your Congressman, I will always pick the Maine people’s side and not the socialist agenda that is ripping our country apart.""

While Cuomo, de Blasio and New York Democrats seek to limit the rights and freedoms of law-abiding New Yorkers, dangerous criminals are allowed free rein.
That is why I am writing to you today to ask you to renew your New York Republican Party membership for the 2020 election cycle.
This is no time to sit back--our mission is more critical than ever. Democrats in New York have already delivered a disastrous end to bail laws that are putting violent criminals right back onto the streets. They have already gutted the NYPD's budget and they won't be happy until they have completely dismantled everything that makes our country so special.
We’re counting on loyal members like you to help us ensure our strong Republican candidates have the resources they need to fight back against this extremism.
According to our records, you have not yet renewed your New York Republican Party membership for the 2020 election cycle.

President Trump is counting on us to deliver him a big re-election victory, and he told me personally how important it is to him to win right here in New York.
We worked tirelessly to recruit strong Republicans to run for office and I’m so excited about the slate of new fighters who are running this year to restore common sense and balance to government.
Everything is on the line.
Restoring two-party government is essential to New York’s future. Our wins this year will preserve the New York Republican Party for the next decade after redistricting.
Democrats’ extreme policies have already driven more than a million New Yorkers to other states and we are facing an even greater mass exodus thanks to coronavirus and the unraveling of our public safety.
We cannot afford to let this radical agenda gain a permanent foothold in New York.
We can stop all of this NOW, and we WILL.
It’s time for common sense to make a comeback in New York and it starts now with the NYGOP.
As a sustaining 2020 member, you will play a vital role in our New York GOP operations. If we’re going to win again, we’re going to need every member to renew their commitment to the NYGOP.

418,"Hi ,
AOC's war on cops never ends. She started by attacking the NYPD's budget and saying that it was ""unethical"" that the biggest city in the U.S. has the biggest police budget.
Now she's attacking the police use of tear gas, which prevents police from having to use deadly force, and attacking police use of facial recognition, which helps them catch criminals.
It won't be long before she's calling to take guns away from our officers and leave them as helpless as the police are in Europe!
The only way to end AOC's war on cops is to defeat her this November. Help me finish her political career with a quick $25 donation to our campaign right now.
DONATE NOW
As a former NYPD officer myself, I can see where our police departments need reform. Less lethal options should be encouraged and body cameras should be required.
But trying to take away less lethal options, like teargas, will only encourage police officers to use greater force when it comes time to stop rioting and looting. While it is still an unfortunate option, it's better for police officers to use tear gas to disperse a crowd than for them to use their billy clubs.
Furthermore, police use of facial recognition isn't ""racist"". It helps our dedicated law enforcement officers catch criminals who would otherwise remain on our streets. Police have every right to use technology that makes their jobs more effective.
AOC should try spending a day in the shoes of our hardworking police officers before she dares to tell them how to do their jobs.
When I defeat her this November, I'll be putting an end to her ignorant attacks on our police. Join our campaign to defeat this anti-cop socialist right now with a one time donation of $35 or more.
The hardworking families of the Bronx and Queens that I've gotten to know over the past year of campaigning don't want to live in a city without police. They don't want the police department defunded because they know that will mean more crime in our neighborhoods and schools.
While our district is heavily Democratic, voters here are willing to vote for a Republican like me because they know I'll stand for law and order.
Police reform is quickly becoming the deciding issue of our race, and it has AOC scared. She knows how unpopular her ""defund the police"" position is within the district, and she knows it's threatening her reelection.
I have a real shot at defeating her this November, but I need your help to fight back against the millions of dollars she's going to spend attacking me.
Make a generous contribution of $60, $85, $110 or more to our campaign right now and help me stay in this fight. It's a long way to November, and I need the support of grassroots conservatives like you to keep going.
I'm counting on the generosity of Americans like you, who support our police, and stand for our flag, to maintain our campaign's momentum.

Alex,
When I was a cop in Queens and the Bronx we kept the peace, but now violent crime is skyrocketing.
Instead of finding solutions to keep our neighborhoods safe, AOC's waging a radical campaign to defund the police and attacking the brave men and women who keep us safe.
It's time we defund AOC and stop her from doing any more damage to our community.

421,"Dear Alex,
We always hear that socialists have the best intentions. Unfortunately, those intentions are paving the path to hell here in New York. The most recent example is so-called bail reform.
The new law makes it almost impossible for judges to require suspects arrested for non-felony crimes pay cash bail for their release. As a result, anyone who is charged with a misdemeanor or a nonviolent felony is automatically released without having to post bail.
Are you kidding me?
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Corez cheered the passage of the law, and has suggested that other states follow New York's lead. She's even talked about bringing it to the federal level!
The only problem is this ""reform"" has already driven up crime dramatically.
I was on Fox and Friends this week, to share some stats that come from my police precinct, in my district - District 14 - for the week ending February 9th:
Robbery is up 23%
Burglary is up 33%
Felony assault is up 47%
Grand Larceny Auto is up 225%
These policies are endangering our families, and making our neighborhoods and schools unsafe. If you want to help me defeat this weak on crime socialist, please donate $30, $45, or $60 to our campaign right now.
I will not stand for this. I won't let AOC turn New York City into a crime infested skid row. Proposals like bail reform are threatening everything that Mayor Giuliani worked for a decade to accomplish.
New York City was a dangerous place before his tough on crime policies saved our city. During his tenure, the police force was increased by 35 percent, and officers had the support of both the government and the people.
As a former cop, I know that hiring more officers isn't enough. They need to be able to do their jobs, and under Giuliani they were. Misdemeanor arrests increased by 70 percent compared to the previous decade, and violent crime dropped by 56 percent in the city by the time he left office.
Republicans like Rudy Giuliani saved New York City from decades of Democrat mismanagement, and the time has come for us to do it again.
I'm running to defeat AOC, and ensure that she doesn't have the chance to take bail reform to the federal level. Help me put an end to this insanity with a quick $50, $85, or $120 donation right now.
It won't be long before AOC and Bernie Sanders are campaigning for bail reform in your state. She's already been talking up the policy during her stump speeches in Iowa and New Hampshire, and there are dozens more states to go during the Democratic primary season.
If she's re-elected this November, and the Democrats hold onto control of the House, they could very well impose this same bail reform scheme nationwide.
We have to stop that from happening, and stopping AOC from winning a second term is a major step towards killing this dangerous proposal.
Your gift of $150 or more to our campaign will give us the financial support we need to fight her through November, and win on election day.
Together we can take back this district for the hardworking families of The Bronx and Queens who deserve a tough on crime approach from their Congressperson.

424,"Dear Alex,
There was some tragic news this past weekend here in the Bronx. Two NYPD officers were shot while sitting in their patrol car in an assassination style attack.
I'm praying for their quick recovery, and for their families, and I hope that you will join me.
Unfortunately, these horrible attacks are merely the latest in a series of anti-police violence. The left has been demonizing our law enforcement officers for years now, and this is the result of that endless propaganda.
Attacks like these prove that there needs to be a dramatic change in the way that New York City politicians act towards cops. And it has to start at the top.
Mayor Bill de Blasio has repeatedly undermined the hardworking officers of the NYPD and allied himself with leftist extremists. The radicals he's siding with are demanding police officers stop carrying guns, and stop patrolling crime ridden neighborhoods!
You and I both know that is no way to protect New York families.
The Sergeant's Benefit Association, a major New York City police organization, has had enough of Mayor Bill de Blasio's attitude towards police. They tweeted the following after the recent attacks:
This tweet is proof that liberal New York City politicians have failed our police officers. The left has created the violent atmosphere that lead to these attacks, and that must be ended before anyone else gets hurt.
Our police officers need support at the federal level too, and they will have it unreservedly when I am elected to Congress.
As a former NYPD officer myself, backing the blue will be a top priority for me in Congress after I defeat AOC this November.
Our police officers need to know that the politicians who represent them have their backs, and I will. I served as a police officer here in the Bronx, and with New York City's Harbor Unit.
That service taught me what our cops need to do their jobs - they need to know the public respects and supports them.
If you support our police officers, and want another ally of law enforcement in Congress, please join our campaign to defeat AOC right now. I need real Americans like you to fight against the radical socialists donating millions to her campaign.
With your help, we can put an end to this anti-police propaganda, and restore honest representation to the people of the 14th District who deserve change.
Thank you for your support.

Hi ,
I couldn't believe my ears when I heard AOC attempt to explain why New York City is facing the most violent crime wave in twenty years.
She claimed that we're having the bloodiest summer in decades because people ""need to shoplift some bread or go hungry that night.”
You've got to be kidding me!
Murders are up 23%. The number of shooting victims is up 70%. This is a direct result of Mayor Bill de Blasio suspending anti-crime NYPD units and AOC taking the side of gang members, rioters, and looters.
Join our campaign to defeat this deranged socialist today with a quick $25 donation today. I need your help to save New York City from AOC.
DONATE NOW
It is clear from the crimes being committed that these are not crimes of desperation. It is not the poor, who have been forced into unemployment by government mandated lockdowns, who are driving this crisis.
On July 4th weekend alone there were ten people shot and killed in the city. One was a man shot in a drive-by while walking his 6-year-old daughter across the street!
These are gang-related and drug-related crimes!
Anyone should be able to see that, and should be able to admit it, without having to cover for their political leanings. But not AOC!
She has proven herself incapable of putting politics aside to do what's best for our district. Siding with criminals who want less police, instead of hardworking families who want more police, is the last straw.
Voters in the district are ready to show AOC the door, but I need your help to continue reaching them. Help me continue our campaign's momentum by sending a fast $40 donation right now.
The New York City Council just voted to take $1 billion out of the NYPD's budget and AOC is supporting the move. She's upset it hasn't been cut more!
The families and neighbors I know in the district don't support making their schools and neighborhoods less safe by removing police officers. We need more officers now more than ever!
I've talked to lifelong Democrats who are ready to vote for me, and vote Republican for the first time, because of AOC's anti-cop positions.
As a former NYPD officer myself, voters of all political persuasions are looking to me to stop this socialist nightmare from destroying our city.
Our campaign has never been closer to defeating AOC this November, but I need your help to keep capitalizing on this moment. Your generous gift of $60, $85, $110 or more right now will go directly towards helping me make AOC a one-term Congresswoman.
I'm counting on Americans like you, who support our police and stand for our flag, to help me defeat this delusional socialist. I need you to become a member of our grassroots army today.

View in browser
Dear Alex,
When I entered this race last year I was running because my students told me that I would make a good Congressperson. They respected my knowledge of the Constitution and our country's history, and thought that our district deserved a Representative who would govern based on those principles.
I hoped and dreamed that our campaign would one day rise to the level of an official endorsement from the local Republican parties that I have always respected. And that day has finally come.
The Bronx Republican Party and Queens Republican Party have officially endorsed my campaign to defeat AOC this November!
It has never been more clear that our campaign is the choice for Republicans in the 14th District. We have already won the endorsements from the Bronx Conservative Party, Queens Conservative Party, and the New York State Conservative Party.
Conservatives and Republicans from across the district are united behind our campaign, and with their support, we can take the fight to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and win.
But we need help from conservatives like you as well. We need the financial support of Republicans from across the country to counter the millions of dollars that AOC's army of socialists has already donated.
Join our campaign to defeat socialism right now with a quick $35 donation.
The so-called bail reform that AOC is supporting has resulted in thousands of people arrested for crimes being released onto our streets without being required to pay cash bail. This policy is endangering the families who call The Bronx and Queens home.
The people of the 14th District were already upset with AOC for kicking Amazon out of Queens and costing them tens of thousands of high paying jobs. She has repeatedly thrown salt on that wound and refused to admit she was wrong.
These actions have made AOC more unpopular than ever before here in the district. My friends and neighbors are ready to make her a one-term Congresswoman.
But she still has millions of liberals on Twitter from San Francisco to Seattle who are donating to her campaign. All of the Hollywood celebrities who trash our President are donating millions more. She's going to try and buy reelection, and we need your help to stop her.
You can help stop this from happening with a gift of $60, $85, $110 or more right now. Our campaign relies on the support of real Americans like you.
Everything that AOC has done over the past year has diminished her support here in the district. She may be popular with Bernie Sanders socialists on social media, but she doesn't represent the honest families that I live and work with.
It is quickly becoming a close race, but we still have a lot of ground to cover before November. We need convince voters of all stripes, from independents to moderate Democrats, that it's time to try something new and vote Republican.
As a former NYPD officer and high school civics teacher who has lived and worked here my entire life, I have that cross-party appeal. We can win those voters over, but first we need to reach them with our message.
Help me reach those voters with a $90 donation to our campaign today. Your contribution will go directly towards defeating AOC this November.

NYGOP Chairman Nick Langworthy Calls for Cuomo, State Leaders to Condemn Democrat Socialists of America Violence and Riot Against President Trump Supporters in Ithaca
\--
Perpetrators Must be Prosecuted
Calls for Radical Cornell Professor Celebrating the Violence to Be Terminated
New York--October 17, [[URL REDACTED]] New York Republican Party today called on Governor Andrew Cuomo and the state’s Democrat leaders to condemn the violent protest and riot led by the Democrat Socialists of America’s Ithaca chapter yesterday and for the perpetrators who committed crimes to be prosecuted.
Democrat socialists descended on Republicans who organized a peaceful rally in support of President Trump in front of the Tompkins Republican Party campaign headquarters. Members of the DSA initiated violence, threats, destruction of property and forced the shutdown of the highway while cornering the President’s supporters.
A female Trump supporter had to be taken to the hospital after her shoulder was dislocated, rioters were ripping signs and hats from supporters and burning them while threatening their safety. The campaign headquarters was spray painted with “Trump Dies” and “Jesus Hates Cops.” Police were forced to close Route 13 as protestors yelled at them “Cops and Klan go hand in hand.” DSA members cornered the President’s supporters forcing them inside their building.
Despite news reports detailing what happened, no Democrats, including local candidates Tracy Mitrano who is running for Congress and Leslie Danks Burke who is running for state senate have come out to condemn the violence.
“The violence and rioting of Democrat Socialists against peaceful New Yorkers exercising their First Amendment rights is disgusting and must be unequivocally condemned by our state’s leaders,” said New York Republican Chairman Nick Langworthy. “The perpetrators of this violence must be prosecuted and there must be a clear message that this behavior will not be tolerated. It is the radical left who is filled with hate and violence and they must be stopped.”
“From their social media postings and what happened it looks like these Democrat Socialists came looking for trouble and to deprive the Republican rallies of their civil rights, using violence and intimidation to do so,” said Tompkins County Republican Chairman Mike Sigler. “They were an angry mob who terrorized people. Some were physically hurt and they destroyed our property. The vitriol and hate against people who don’t share their authoritarian views is nothing short of reprehensible. This is what we are fighting against in this election.”
Chairman Langworthy also blasted radical Cornell History Professor Russell Rickford, a member of the DSA for celebrating the violent event and calling it a “joyful display” and “positive affirmation of an alternative politics.”
He concluded, “Any adult who celebrates violence, destruction of property and physically threatening another human being has no business being employed by an educational institution. He completely crossed the line with his actions and his comments and he should be immediately terminated. Shame on him.”

Workplace Discrimination
Dear Friend,
Today, the Supreme Court delivered a landmark win for equality and justice in our country. In a 6-3 decision, the Court ruled that gender identity and sexual orientation are protected from workplace discrimination under Title VII of the Civil RIghts Act of 1964. Discrimination against LGBTQ persons, however, continues and is a goal of the current Administration and its supporters in Congress, including Jackie Walorski.
The decision highlights what is at stake in November. Jackie Walorski is virulently anti-LGBTQ. Pat Hackett will be the first openly LGBTQ member of Congress from Indiana and believes in Dignity and Justice for All. Unlike Jackie, Pat understands that discrimination is not a Hoosier or American value.
In 2016, Jackie offered her full support to the Russell Amendment, a horrific piece of legislation that made government funding of discrimination against LGBTQ persons under the guise of religious liberty perfectly legal. Jackie’s view was extreme and out of step with the bipartisan main. Jackie also opposed marriage equality and hate crime legislation that includes LGBTQ protections. She continues to oppose the Equality Act.
Jackie is out of step with the goodness of the people of this District. She is harmful to LGBTQ families and proud in her support of the Pence/Trump Administration. Can you invest in our campaign to send Pat Hackett to Washington as our Representative and advocate for Dignity and Justice for All?

Joe Biden's Job Killing Tax Increase Plan 💸
Wednesday, I joined Charles Payne on Fox Business to discuss Joe Biden’s plan to raise taxes in just about every facet of our lives. Biden made bogus claims that he will bring manufacturing jobs back to the US.
In reality, President Obama and Vice-President Biden permanently destroyed one million manufacturing jobs during their administration. President Trump then fostered an economic boom that added over half a million manufacturing jobs in his first three years.
City Council That Approved Abolishing Police:
""Where Are the Police?"" 😳
I wish I could say this headline was satire. Sadly, it's not. Months ago I predicted that efforts to defund law enforcement by the left would result in high levels of crime. Especially in neighborhoods that need protection the most. That is exactly what residents in NYC, Seattle, Chicago, and Minneapolis are now experiencing.
Police and local law enforcement need more funding and more support to do their jobs, not less. I hope these liberal Democrat politicians recognize the fatal errors in their radical policies. Alas, I am not holding my breath.

Senate Democrats Block Economic Relief 😠
Thursday, Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats unanimously voted against Mitch McConnell’s “skinny” COVID relief plan. The package would have funded the Paycheck Protection Program and delivered economic aid to Americans who need it most.

New York’s Attorney General, Letitia James filed a lawsuit against the National Rifle Association (NRA) last week, with the intent to dissolve the organization.
Her attempts to take down the association which protects our second amendment rights, is a political attempt to appease the far left. New York City crime is skyrocketing but, James would rather play politics than protect her constituents.

Members of the far-left continue to spread disorder and lawlessness. Not only do they refuse to condemn rioting and vandalism, they encourage it:
Representative Ilhan Omar thinks troublemakers are “angelic.” I disagree.
I need your help to restore law and order to our streets.
Yes, I Will Donate to Restore Order
We are lucky to live in a country where free speech is welcomed, and we should not take that for granted. We need to use our voices to bring about change - not violence.
Unfortunately, radical voices are promoting violence and I need your help to fight back.
The squad just introduced a bill that would:
❌ Prevent police officers from doing their jobs.
❌ Make it impossible to recruit qualified officers.
❌ Increase crime rates through the roof.
Can you help me stop this bill and stand up to the radical liberals in Congress?
Yes, I Will Donate to Restore Order
In liberty,

The DNC's convention was virtual; the rising stars featured from Texas are real
Along with the big names this week were a host of rising stars from Texas, including Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, who has led the fight against COVID-19 in Houston, keynote appearances by Congressman Colin Allred and State Rep. Victoria Neave, both from Dallas, and Congresswoman Veronica Escobar, who represented the state during the roll call vote and paid homage to the lives lost to gun violence last year.
In addition to the leaders from these areas, we’re seeing new leaders rise up for progress all over Texas. When progressive values are on the ballot, Texans are energized. In November, we can capture that energy, but only if we’re able to get every progressive registered to vote at their current address and out to the polls.

# More Progress
The COVID-19 pandemic has made one thing clear - we have serious problems with how Texans can access health care. Abortion care is no exception.
Democrats are confident Kamala Harris can unify the Party. Ed Espinoza, Executive Director of Progress Texas, thinks that progressives will be able to work with the Biden-Harris Administration if they win in November.
As cities like Dallas, Fort Worth, and San Antonio take up their annual budgets, it’s important to know that an overwhelming majority of Texas voters agree that police brutality is a problem. Local officials must act, regardless of the threats from Gov. Abbott.
Progressives made a big impact in South Texas elections this year, and while the candidates came up short - the strength of these campaigns signal a changing political landscape in South Texas.

Hi Alex,
The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the flaws in our state system. It’s shown us how a lack of access to health insurance, vast income inequality, and unaddressed racial inequities exacerbate the hardships faced during a crisis.
Read more: Legalizing marijuana could alleviate Texas economic losses
Marijuana legalization could address many of these flaws and is a win-win in more ways than one. Taxes from marijuana sales could help offset deficits from COVID-19, legalization would open the door to new business opportunities, and decriminalization could have an immediate impact on Texans imprisoned for marijuana-related crimes.
Legalizing marijuana can be a win for Texas
Many think it is only a matter of time before Texas eases restrictions and legalizes marijuana. If it is inevitable, then why wait? There are too many benefits to ignore.
Progressively yours,
Wesley Story

We need to win nine races to flip the Texas House
We have 22 opportunities to do so. And if we do, then we can change Texas politics for a decade.
Imagine the impact of a progressive Texas Legislature leading redistricting. That means expanding Medicaid, increasing funding for public schools, using the Texas Rainy Day Fund to help every day Texans, and more.
We can do it. Many of these seats overlap several counties so if you live in a red, blue, or purple county at the presidential level - every vote counts at the legislative level!

# More Progress
Whether Dan Patrick agrees or not, it is time to take down Confederate monuments across Texas.
This week the RNC featured one of Trump’s favorite congressmen, Dan Crenshaw. We didn’t want to hear from him, so we gave the spotlight to his progressive challenger, Sima Ladjevardian.
Gov. Abbott was right to expand early vote by a week, but now Republicans are suing to take it away. Even when they get something right, they find a way to screw it up!
There has been a 700% increase in crimes committed by White House advisors during Trump Administration. Putting him in charge for “law and order” is like asking the wolf to guard the sheep.

437,"Sen. Cornyn is putting politics over country, again.
Friend,
MJ Hegar and Senator Cornyn both took oaths. But Senator Cornyn is violating his -- he’s made it clear as impeachment proceedings move to the Senate that he will not judge the case on the facts. Just look at the email he sent his supporters below, blindly defending President Trump and pledging to “wrap up this sham impeachment with an acquittal” less than an hour after the House voted to impeach.
DONATE TO HELP MJ BEAT SEN. CORNYN >>
Instead of impartially listening to the facts, Sen. Cornyn will put his loyalty to his D.C. bosses ahead of his duty to defend the rule of law.
It’s no surprise, though: time and again Sen. Cornyn has helped bury legislation on critical issues -- like universal background checks, lower prescription drug prices, and improved election security -- in Mitch McConnell’s legislative graveyard.
We won’t let him hide from his record of putting his D.C. bosses and the special interests over Texans. MJ Hegar knows what it means to uphold an oath, and she’s not a political puppet who will put D.C. interests ahead of her constituents. Can you pitch in to help her build the campaign she needs to DEFEAT Senator Cornyn?
DONATE NOW

438,"Make your voice heard
Friends,
Since 1918, there have been nearly 200 failed attempts to make lynching a federal crime.
What you do now will determine if our next attempt fails again, or if we finally get it done. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Tim Scott have a bill that has strong bipartisan support. It would pass and be sitting on the President's desk to sign or veto -- but Mitch McConnell won't bring it to the floor for a vote. Yesterday, it took only one extremist Senator to block it.
This isn’t partisan. There are plenty of votes in both parties to pass this. That’s why Mitch McConnell won’t allow a vote. He wants it to fail for what is close to the 200th time.
Contact your Senator. Demand that a vote be held. Sign my petition and make your voice heard today >>
In this moment where we must come together as a country to meaningfully discuss steps toward ending centuries of systemic racism, what a horrible message the failure of this bill would be. Passing this bill is far from the only thing we must do to combat injustice and racism, but when we have an opportunity to right an obvious wrong with bipartisan support, we must seize it.
We cannot let Mitch McConnell stop what is so clearly the right thing to do.
Thank you.

Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend, my loyalty has always been with the people of Michigan and our country.
That’s why I swore to be an impartial juror and to defend our Constitution – so when facts presented over the last few weeks showed that the president put his personal and political interests ahead of our nation, I voted to remove him from office.
Here’s what it came down to for me: No one is above the law – no one, not even the president.
But it didn’t take long for Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump to set their sights on me for my vote – and now, Senate Republicans have announced they will stop at nothing to defeat me.
I’m not scared of them. I’ve been in tough fights before, and I won’t be intimidated. But the unfortunate truth is that Trump and McConnell are flooding Michigan with millions of dollars to try and ensure that I lose my race.
The good news: Democrats have a real shot at taking back the Senate this year. But if we lose here in Michigan, we also lose any chance to regain control. That means we’ll see at least two more years of a Republican Senate covering up Trump’s crimes.
I don’t have the same network of far-right billionaires and special interests that McConnell and Trump can dispatch at will. But I have grassroots supporters like you, friend.
We set a goal to raise $10,000 to prepare for the onslaught of attacks the GOP has promised are coming our way – unfortunately, we fell a bit short.
Now we’re hoping to close the gap. It would mean the world if you could chip in $3 before midnight – here’s your secure link: [[URL REDACTED]]

DEFEAT LINDSEY GRAHAM
Here’s what we already knew: Lindsey is one of the president’s most loyal lackeys in the Senate. After getting EMBARRASSED by Trump during their presidential runs, he turned into Trump’s loudest, proudest supporter in the Senate.
But it doesn’t end there… in his confirmation hearing to rush Amy Coney Barrett onto the Supreme Court, he referred to the “good old days of segregation.”
Lindsey Graham is unfit to represent South Carolina.
Jaime Harrison is on a mission to send Lindsey packing, and right now the polls have never been closer. Will you chip in a split donation between Jaime and Eric so that we can defeat Lindsey Graham?

Lindsey knows his seat is vulnerable this year. That’s why last month he was literally BEGGING for donations on Fox News. And yesterday, he commited a crime in plain sight by asking for donations from the Capitol!!!
But we have a message for Lindsey — No matter how many times you beg for GOP super PACs to swoop in and save the day, you won’t be able to stop the grassroots movement Jaime Harrison has created in South Carolina.
The polling between Jaime Harrison and Lindsey Graham is neck-and-neck. Will you split a donation between Jaime’s and Eric’s campaign to help us defeat Lindsey and flip the Senate blue?

Brynne Kennedy for Congress
Alex --
Back in 2003, Tom McClintock led a recall campaign to nullify the 2002 election of California’s Democratic Governor -- over a policy disagreement.
Earlier this week on Fox News (and yesterday on the House floor), McClintock said that we shouldn’t hold a President of his own party accountable for potential crimes against the constitution, because of the outcome of the 2016 election.
Huh? This is what blind partisanship looks like. And it’s why we need to retire Tom McClintock from Congress.
McClintock cares more about party than doing what’s right. And that’s why we must defeat him in 2020. Will you chip in to help?

I’m running for Congress to put our country and community first. That means reaching across the aisle to get things done. It means working with a President of either party when they are right -- and doing the right thing when the President or party bosses are wrong.
But that’s not how Tom McClintock rolls:
* He shut down our government and devastated the CA-04 economies that depend on our national parks in a partisan effort to eliminate healthcare for people with pre-existing conditions.
* He voted for a tax bill that literally took money out of the pockets of families, small businesses, and even wildfire victims in our community in order to give it to wealthy special interests out of state.
* Last week alone, he voted against bipartisan measures to support CA-04 farmers and save local families thousands of dollars in prescription drug costs because his party bosses and special interest funders told him to.
Please chip in to help me defeat McClintock and send someone who will put country over party to Congress.
Last night, the House of Representatives performed its duty to uphold our Constitution. Now that duty moves to the Senate.
The President deserves a fair trial and the American people deserve the full truth. Leaders Schumer and McConnell must work together to ensure a fair process in the Senate, and a jury that is focused on facts and free of partisan interference. And I hope the President will participate and tell his side of the story.
As important as this work is, there is so much more that also needs to be done to make life better for all Americans. But it is clear that Tom McClintock has no interest in anything beyond blind partisanship.
Our community deserves better, and that’s what this campaign is all about. Thanks for standing with us.

Jacob Blake is innocent. But that didn’t stop Kenosha police officers from shooting him 7 times in the back for no reason.
But the officers who shot Blake, leaving him paralyzed for life, still haven’t been charged with any crime -- it’s unbelievable, Alex.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are DEMANDING the officer who shot Blake be charged and held accountable for his crime, and they need EVERY good Democrat standing with them to call for IMMEDIATE justice.
Alex, Biden and Harris need 100,000 activists to sign on TODAY. Justice cannot wait. Sign your name now →
I DEMAND JUSTICE. ADD MY NAME ➞
Alex -- justice must be served.
Jacob Blake was shot in front of his three small children. He spent the following days in the hospital fighting for his life. He’s paralyzed.
“Dismantling systemic racism starts with demanding justice and holding offenders accountable. Based on what I've seen, it seems the officer should be charged.”
Kamala Harris
Jacob Blake is innocent. But his innocence couldn’t protect him from the horrors of police brutality. Just like it couldn’t protect George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and countless more.
What makes this all even worse is that Kenosha cops were seen cozying up to white supremacists in the ensuing protests. Their racism runs deep.
So we’re standing with Biden and Harris to DEMAND the officer who shot Blake be charged.
Biden and Harris need every Good Democrat standing with them to DEMAND justice for Jacob Blake. Sign on to demand the officer who shot Blake be charged →

Black Americans deserve the right to get into their own car, free from harm.

Tom O'Halleran for Congress
25 years ago, the United States signed into law the Violence Against Women Act. Since then, this watershed legislation has been foundational in our efforts to investigate, prosecute and eliminate violent crimes committed against women.
But last February, Congress failed to reauthorize the bill. I fought back then and I am continuing to fight back now because this is a massive blow to the safety of women and girls across our country and it must be corrected.
Inaction is just unacceptable. Add your name to this petition and tell Congress we need to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act now!
SIGN HERE
Protecting women from violence is not and should never be a partisan issue. Our job as representatives is to fight for everyone’s best interests, including women and girls.
I will proudly fight for reauthorization of this critical bill in Congress. It’s simple to me, but for others, they need to hear the urgency in our calls to action. That’s why I need your help.
Join your voice with mine to call on Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Every day we sit on our hands, we put another person’s life in danger. We cannot let this inaction go on any longer!
Thank you for making your voice heard,

460,"Alex,
The murder of George Floyd started with three words: “forgery in progress.”
You may know the story that brought us here. Mr. Floyd went to a grocery store and paid with a $20 bill — but the currency was no good. The shop owner called the police. And like so many times before, the officers who responded took a Black man’s life.
For a $20 crime.
This may go without saying, but I will say it: if I had paid with that bill, I would be alive today. My body would not have been on a Minneapolis street. No officer would have pushed their knee into my neck.
If a white man from a privileged background pays with a fake $20 bill? 99 times out of 100, it would be dismissed as “a mistake.”
The moment we are in is historic — massive nationwide protests to demand an end to racist police killings. During a health pandemic that has taken over 100,000 lives. During an economic crisis. Under a dictatorial and vindictive president.
Yet I am struck by this incident in another way — as a father.
Because I have a counterfeit $20 bill in my possession right now, given to me by my daughter.
How did she get it? Well, she’s eight years old, and a Girl Scout. Like countless girls across the nation, she was busy selling cookies this Spring. Learning economics and team-building and communication skills and more.
And one day, someone bought several boxes of cookies and gave her a fake $20 bill.
We didn’t realize it until later. If you haven’t sold Girl Scout cookies before — the parents buy cookies in advance, and then pay ourselves back as we make sales. Weeks ago, my wife went to deposit the money we collected, and happened to notice this bill. It didn’t feel right. On closer inspection, even though much of the design is the same, you can see words that are different. It says “Motion Picture Use Purposes.”
So we wrote it off as a loss. And I had the bill on my desk when I learned how George Floyd was killed.
You may know this: my daughter is Black. Her mother is Nigerian-American. Living in Texas—let’s be honest, living in the United States—she is perceived differently than I was at her age.
And maybe at 8-years old, a shop owner wouldn’t perceive her as a threat if she tried to buy candy or Pokémon cards with this counterfeit bill. Maybe.
But what if she was a little older? 10 years old? 12 years old? At what point does your life become expendable in this country, by virtue of the color of your skin?
It shouldn’t be this way. Racism may be the “original sin” of the United States, as some have said, but it does not have to be our destiny.
That is why we are in the streets. That is why in every state in the Union, in towns big and small, people young and old are marching for justice.
And to demand that Black Lives Matter.
As a candidate for Congress, my pledge is to fight for major criminal justice reforms. Several leading members of Congress, including Congresswomen Ayanna Pressley and Barbara Lee, have put forward essential bills that will create accountability for local police. A database of police abuse; ending qualified immunity for officers who violate constitutional rights; stopping the transfer of military equipment to local police; and investing in Black and other over-policed communities, to lay the foundation for transformative change.
I will certainly fight for these reforms. In the Texas 10th, we have our own history of racist policing. Sandra Bland died in police custody in Waller County, after a racist and unconstitutional arrest. Rodney Reed has been on Texas Death Row for decades — for a crime likely committed by a white former police officer.
There are countless reasons to demand change at every level of government, right now.
And one of those reasons is for the future. To protect our children as they grow up in this society. To ensure that their lives will be treated as sacred. To make certain that Black Lives Matter.
Fighting for you,
Mike Siegel

We need to win nine races to flip the Texas House
We have 22 opportunities to do so. And if we do, then we can change Texas politics for a decade.
Imagine the impact of a progressive Texas Legislature leading redistricting. That means expanding Medicaid, increasing funding for public schools, using the Texas Rainy Day Fund to help every day Texans, and more.
We can do it. Many of these seats overlap several counties so if you live in a red, blue, or purple county at the presidential level - every vote counts at the legislative level!

# More Progress
Whether Dan Patrick agrees or not, it is time to take down Confederate monuments across Texas.
This week the RNC featured one of Trump’s favorite congressmen, Dan Crenshaw. We didn’t want to hear from him, so we gave the spotlight to his progressive challenger, Sima Ladjevardian.
Gov. Abbott was right to expand early vote by a week, but now Republicans are suing to take it away. Even when they get something right, they find a way to screw it up!
There has been a 700% increase in crimes committed by White House advisors during Trump Administration. Putting him in charge for “law and order” is like asking the wolf to guard the sheep.

LISA SCHELLER ENDORSED BY THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE, STROUD LODGE # 75
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Brooke Race
[[URL REDACTED]]
Allentown, Pa. – Today, the Scheller Campaign is honored to receive its second unanimous endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police. 130 members of Stroud Lodge 75 FOP are committed to supporting Lisa in this upcoming election. The FOP is a fraternal organization consisting of sworn law enforcement officers in the United States. This endorsement is a testament to the fact that Lisa has shown that she will truly stand up and support our law enforcement. While Lisa’s opponent, Susan Wild, wants to risk our safety and the security of Pennsylvania families by defunding and dismantling the police.
Lisa released the following statement after the endorsement:
“I am honored to receive this endorsement from FOP Lodge 75. The law enforcement community has my complete support. I promise to stand up for those who continue to excel in making the Lehigh Valley a safe place to live for us and our families. We cannot allow the streets to be filled with chaos and lawlessness.

Alex,
Today, House Democrats did the unthinkable… After weeks of hearings that have failed to bring a single fact to light, they have abandoned due process and made it official:
President Donald J. Trump is now just the third president in U.S. history to be impeached by the House of Representatives.
Regardless of your own personal opinion on our president, what the Democrats just did tears at the fabric of our democracy.
Our constitution reserves impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors… things that require facts to prove… not just a personal dislike.
We can’t stand by idly as Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff use impeachment as a weapon to undo the results of the 2016 election! I’m asking you to join me in rejecting the misguided impeachment process that Democrats are pursuing… something our current representative FAILED to do.
STOP IMPEACHMENT
STOP THE RADICAL LEFT
Alex, this is bigger than any one of us.
This is even bigger than President Trump.
This is about the future of our democracy, and the preservation of our Constitution. I need you to join me in sending a message to Nancy Pelosi and the radical Democrats in Congress: the American people DO NOT support this unjust impeachment: Join me here!
Time’s running short. We need to send this message quickly!

LISA SCHELLER RELEASES FIFTH COALITION TODAY “POLICE FOR SCHELLER”
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Brooke Race
[[URL REDACTED]]
Allentown, Pa. – Today, the Scheller Campaign is proud to announce its fifth coalition, Police for Scheller. Lisa Scheller strongly stands with our men and women in blue. The police are the first responders to a broad range of public-safety issues and serious crime. Chairman, Patrick Cubbage, served in the US Army and has over 30 years experience in law enforcement.
Patrick released the following statement:
“Lisa is willing to stand up and fight for PA07. She is a patriot, not a socialist. I was motivated to support her when I first heard her speak at her congressional candidate announcement. She proved that by fighting for the people in Lehigh County to lower their taxes. Lisa will bring that same energy to fight for everyone in the 7th Congressional District, especially law enforcement. She supports Law and Order and will defend the police, not defund them. She is willing to give up her salary in support of veterans and other charities that will benefit the Lehigh Valley. She is the candidate we need.”
JOIN POLICE FOR SCHELLER NOW

We need to win nine races to flip the Texas House
We have 22 opportunities to do so. And if we do, then we can change Texas politics for a decade.
Imagine the impact of a progressive Texas Legislature leading redistricting. That means expanding Medicaid, increasing funding for public schools, using the Texas Rainy Day Fund to help every day Texans, and more.
We can do it. Many of these seats overlap several counties so if you live in a red, blue, or purple county at the presidential level - every vote counts at the legislative level!

# More Progress
Whether Dan Patrick agrees or not, it is time to take down Confederate monuments across Texas.
This week the RNC featured one of Trump’s favorite congressmen, Dan Crenshaw. We didn’t want to hear from him, so we gave the spotlight to his progressive challenger, Sima Ladjevardian.
Gov. Abbott was right to expand early vote by a week, but now Republicans are suing to take it away. Even when they get something right, they find a way to screw it up!
There has been a 700% increase in crimes committed by White House advisors during Trump Administration. Putting him in charge for “law and order” is like asking the wolf to guard the sheep.
Progress Texas is looking for a communications intern to join our team for the fall semester. Interns will receive $15/hour and the position is remote. Apply today!

466,"President Trump suggests supporters illegally vote twice to test mail-in vs in-person
Yeah… you read that right, Alex. Trump just told his own constituents to commit voter fraud.
To reiterate: illegally commit voter fraud.
This is just embarrassing. On top of who-knows-how-many crimes he’s committed of his own, he’s now asking voters to follow his lead.
As if. Join us and commit to voting Donald Trump out of the White House:
COMMIT TO VOTING TRUMP OUT THIS NOVEMBER
* * *
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. Donald Trump’s ignorance has tainted the soul of this nation and the very core of our democracy.
And we’re going to put an end to it.
Sign the petition and join our effort to show Trump -- we’re committed to voting this November… once:
COMMIT TO VOTING TRUMP OUT →
This is not a president who believes in democracy. He is an authoritarian who must be defeated. - Bernie Sanders
Bernie is absolutely right. This isn’t a president -- this is an authoritarian.
Trump will meddle in this election any way he can… but we’re not going to let him get away with it much longer.
COMMIT TO VOTING TRUMP OUT →
Let Trump know: these are your last few months in the White House. Enjoy them.

Lindsey Graham needs to go.
DEFEAT LINDSEY GRAHAM
Here’s what we already knew: Lindsey is one of the president’s most loyal lackeys in the Senate. After getting EMBARRASSED by Trump during their presidential runs, he turned into Trump’s loudest, proudest supporter in the Senate.
But it doesn’t end there… in his confirmation hearing to rush Amy Coney Barrett onto the Supreme Court, he referred to the “good old days of segregation.”
Lindsey Graham is unfit to represent South Carolina.
Jaime Harrison is on a mission to send Lindsey packing, and right now the polls have never been closer. Will you chip in a split donation between Jaime and Eric so that we can defeat Lindsey Graham?

Lindsey knows his seat is vulnerable this year. That’s why last month he was literally BEGGING for donations on Fox News. And yesterday, he commited a crime in plain sight by asking for donations from the Capitol!!!
But we have a message for Lindsey — No matter how many times you beg for GOP super PACs to swoop in and save the day, you won’t be able to stop the grassroots movement Jaime Harrison has created in South Carolina.
The polling between Jaime Harrison and Lindsey Graham is neck-and-neck. Will you split a donation between Jaime’s and Eric’s campaign to help us defeat Lindsey and flip the Senate blue?

Donald Trump is nothing if not consistent when it comes to serving the United States of America.
When our country needed him to serve in the Vietnam War, HE LIED to dodge the draft.
When our country needed him to protect us from COVID-19, HE LIED and more than 200,000 Americans have died.
And now we’ve just learned that when our country needed him to pay his fair share of taxes, HE LIED to get out of paying them.
Donald Trump is a liar. He’s been stealing from the American people for decades, doing the crime on your dime. He thinks he’s clever, and can avoid ever having to pay for his crimes and devious accounting.
I need your help to show Trump he’s dead wrong.
Ballots are dropping in many states any day now, and we NEED to make these latest revelations hurt Donald Trump where it matters most — at the ballot box.
My team did the math, and right now we need to raise $4,389 before midnight if we want this news to cut through the noise and reach voters in critical swing states across the country.
Can I count on you to chip in $5 or $25 right now before midnight tonight to help us reach that goal? Time is running out, FAST.

, President Trump reached out to you with an important update about our U.S. Senate race and asked a personal favor — he’s asking YOU to be one of the 7,500 conservatives who step up to keep this seat RED.
I wanted to make sure you hadn’t missed the email.
I couldn’t be prouder to have President Trump’s FULL SUPPORT, and he’s exactly right here.
Democrats and their liberal mega-donors are coming after Kansas with everything they’ve got… and if we don’t step up now, they could flip this seat for the first time in decades. That would hand Chuck Schumer the Senate majority.
I’m ALL-IN on stopping them, and so is President Trump. But we need YOU to join us. So, if you can, will you answer President Trump’s call to take this seat off the Democrats’ map?
We’re counting on you.

They’re raising MILLIONS from liberal mega-donors and Swamp special interests to prop up Roger’s opponent, Barbara Bollier. She is nothing but a rubberstamp for their SOCIALIST agenda.
Unlike the unhinged liberals, Roger Marshall is a champion of our America First agenda — and he has my FULL SUPPORT!

Nebraska Stonewall Democrats have announced their support of our campaign!
The Stonewall Democrats are the largest coalition of LGBTQ and allied Democrats in the country, and they fight every day for equal rights and dignity for all people.
I am so proud to have their support, and it’s an honor I take seriously. So I want to share an overview of my plans to advocate for the LGBTQ community in Congress:
* I will co-sponsor the Equality Act, a comprehensive piece of legislation that bans workplace, housing, and education discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.
* I will fight for the Safe Schools Improvement Act and Family Violence and Prevention Services Act, which make sure that schools are safe places for all students, and that homes are safe places for all members of the family.
* I will address the epidemic of violence against LGBTQ people, particularly transgender women of color, by requiring all hate crimes to be reported to the FBI and implementing anti-bias training for police and public officials.
As a state senator, I made it my mission to create workplace protections for LGBTQ Nebraskans.
Now, I’m taking my mission to Washington, D.C.

Exciting news from (virtual) campaign HQ!
Today our campaign was endorsed today by the Nebraska Stonewall Democrats!
I have always stood up for equal rights.
And I will stand up for equal rights in Washington.
If you are ready for a Congresswoman who will stand up for ALL Nebraskans, consider chipping in today.
Chip-in now >>
And, if you're interested, here's my plan to improve equal rights when I get to Washington:
As a Member of Congress, I will advocate for the best interests of young LGBTQ+ people in both Legislation and in advocacy to administrative agencies. I would add my name as a co-sponsor to the Equality Act.
I will support the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in educational settings, including development of safe spaces for LGBTQ+ students, genders and sexualities alliance networks, provision of mental health services to LGBTQ+ students, and professional development and training for school staff about the needs of LGBTQ+ students.  I will also support the Safe Schools Improvement Act which amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to protect every student from bullying and harassment in K-12 schools.
I will continue to advocate for the Affordable Care Act’s nondiscrimination protections - all people deserve access to quality, affordable health care. I will also advocate for a comprehensive HIV/AIDS strategy, including increasing funding for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program. I will advocate for mental health parity and improve access to mental health care for LGBTQ+ people, especially in schools and rural communities.
Young LGBTQ+ people, like everyone else, deserve fair treatment in the workplace. I made workplace protections legislation my personal priority bill in the Legislature in 2016 and will continue this commitment to equality as a Member of Congress.
I will advocate for LGBTQ+ veterans, including supporting additional training and supportive services under the Supportive Services for Veterans Families program to address fair and competent provision of family support services and health care.
I do not think that health care providers should be able to turn away LGBTQ+ and HIV+ people. I have worked on this issue as a part of the Nebraska Association of Social Workers, advocating that everyone deserves services and referrals. I will continue to do so as a Member of Congress.
I will address the epidemic of violence against LGBTQ+ people, particularly trans women of color, in the following ways:
A reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act should include additional protections for LGBTQ+ people and additional funding for specific programs to serve trans women of color. I also support strengthening nondiscrimination protections in the Family Violence and Prevention Services Act. I will advocate to make permanent the National LGBTQ+ Institute on Intimate Partner Violence.
I support requiring all hate crimes to be reported to the FBI to better understand, track, and prevent violence against LGBTQ+ people. I will also support stronger law enforcement policies to provide additional training to officers to prevent bias and mistreatment and increase community trust.
I'm ready to fight for all Nebraskans in Washington. I've fought for all Nebraskans from day 1 in the Nebraska Legislature.
If you are ready for a Congresswoman who will stand up for ALL Nebraskans, consider chipping in today.
We can't do this without you,

Dear Alex,
In the last few days, I've reached out to people in my community and I've done a lot of listening.
I've listened to the heartache of George Floyd's family and community and I share it.
I've listened to the heartache of James Scurlock's family and community and I share it.
I've listened to young people who have reached out to me, who were involved in peaceful rallies for racial justice and equality, and want their message to be heard.
I've listened to law enforcement officials navigating the balance between keeping people safe and responding humanely to the pain of racism and injustice.
I've listened to business owners while helping to clean up, and I know they are both concerned about their property and concerned about the people in our community.
I've listened to community leaders on phone calls with my friends and leaders in the minority community, working to help, understand, support, and learn.
We have a lot of work to do to confront uncomfortable truths and find a shared way forward.
One contribution I will make towards our shared progress towards more justice and equality is LB 1069, a bill I introduced in the Nebraska Legislature to create a collaborative research center for best practices in preventing violence and expand strategies to intervene in and prevent violence of all kinds. This bill was supported by health care experts, mothers of crime victims, and law enforcement. When we return to session, I'll work tirelessly to pass LB 1069.
I'll continue to listen, and I want to hear from you.
In peace and community,

483,"Team,
This week we saw a historic decision from the Supreme Court that determined people cannot be fired for their gender identity or sexual orientation — a landmark in the continued journey for equality and something we all here at #TeamGood are celebrating! But make no mistake, the fight continues every day.
Our Suncoast community is home to thousands of LGBTQ+ constituents, and while this week brought a huge and historic victory in the Supreme Court, just days before on the anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub shooting, the Trump administration rolled back health care protections for the transgender community.
But it’s not just the Trump administration that turns its back on LGBTQ+ Americans.
Vern Buchanan has stood with Trump and voted time and again against protecting LGBTQ+ Americans. He voted against the bipartisan Equality Act, which would prohibit discrimination against LGBTQ+ people and would have prevented the Trump Administration from rolling back healthcare protections for transgender Americans.
If you’ve had enough of Vern Buchanan, stand with Margaret Good. If you believe that LGBTQ+ Floridians deserve a representative who won't fall silent in the face of the bigotry and who will stand up for their rights, now is the time to take action.
Buchanan voted time and again against the bipartisan Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expands federal hate crime protections to LGBTQ+ individuals and makes it easier for the federal government to prosecute hate crimes based on race, religion, or national origin.
Vern Buchanan has turned his back on the LGBTQ+ community. He refuses to protect our friends, family, and neighbors from discrimination and hate.
If you know it is time for change, add your name to the thousands of reasonable people who are calling for Vern’s retirement.
This is our time.

Friend,
With all the uncertainty in the world, now is the time for our community to come together.
That is why I am outraged by recent reports of hate crimes against the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. From racial epithets to violent crimes, members of our community have endured discrimination that is never acceptable.
Let’s be clear: describing coronavirus as the “China virus”, “Chinese virus”, and “Wuhan virus”, is xenophobic and racist.
It is also unacceptable that the federal government has no plans to combat the rise in AAPI bias and hate crimes. During the SARS outbreak, and after 9/11, federal agencies made a concentrated effort to prevent targeted incidences of hate against minorities, but so far they have failed to address this growing problem during this public health crisis.
In response to this, over 50 local groups have come together to stand against this hate. I am proud to stand with them, and I’d like to use my platform to share their message. Click here to read their letter and then sign on to their letter of support.
Together, we must always stand against hate in all its forms.
In solidarity,
Sara

Friend,
There’s a lot of misinformation going around about coronavirus (also known as COVID-19), so I wanted to use this space to share a few facts in the hopes of dispelling any myths you may have heard. Here are the facts:
1. Even if you don’t have symptoms, you can still be contagious
Many people test positive for COVID-19 but don’t show any symptoms. It is highly contagious and spreads quickly, which is why social distancing and shelter in place orders are so important.
2. There are no current treatments or at-home remedies that can treat COVID-19
While the FDA is rapidly testing potential therapies to treat COVID-19, there is no drug or at-home remedy that is effective or safe. If you or a loved one starts showing symptoms, you should contact your health care provider, but only go to the emergency room if you experience life-threatening symptoms such as difficulty breathing
3. It’s not just seniors who are at risk. Young people can become infected with COVID-19
We now know that COVID-19 isn’t just dangerous for the elderly. Younger people who were otherwise healthy have contracted severe cases of COVID-19 that require hospitalization, and have even resulted in death.
4. It is not a “Chinese virus,” as President Trump has called it
COVID-19 is part of a family called Coronaviruses that does not originate from any specific geographic location or ethnicity. Calling it the “Chinese virus” or any other variation is xenophobic, divisive, and is leading to a rise in hate crimes and harassment against the Asian-American community. We’re all in this together.
For more facts, visit the World Health Organization’s page on advice for the public.
Please feel free to reach out to our campaign for more information, or if we can be of assistance in any way. Team SJ is here to help you during this difficult time.
Thanks,

Friend,
Our country is not living up to its ideals. The killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and others have rightfully caused a national uproar. Black lives matter — and we are not doing enough to protect them.
Fixing the institutionalized racism in our country will take many different steps, but here’s one action we can take now: we must make lynching a federal hate crime.
ADD YOUR NAME
Throughout history, and still now, thousands of Black Americans have been lynched and yet Congress has not made these racial killings a federal hate crime. This should not be controversial in 2020.
The House and Senate have both passed versions of anti-lynching bills in recent years, but one Kentucky Senator is holding up the bill. Enough is enough. Sign your name if you agree that lynching should be a federal hate crime.
In 1892, Ida B. Wells wrote that “the strong arm of the law must be brought to bear upon lynchers in severe punishment, but this cannot and will not be done unless a healthy public sentiment demands and sustains such action.” 128 years later, these words are still true — and it’s on us to show Congress what we, the public, demand.
TELL CONGRESS TO MAKE LYNCHING A HATE CRIME
Our reckoning with our national history of racism is far from over, but this crucial step is long overdue. Tell Congress: we must make lynching a federal hate crime.
Thank you,
Team SJ

487,"Today, the U.S. House of Representatives upheld their Constitutional oath and voted to impeach Donald Trump.
Friend,
Today, the U.S. House of Representatives upheld their Constitutional oath and voted to impeach Donald Trump.
I am grateful to those Members of Congress who voted to put their country over politics. I know that this decision weighed on each of the Members, just as the somber reality of impeaching a United States President is weighing on millions of Americans. It is not the easy decision or the politically expedient decision, but the right one.
There is no ambiguity here: the evidence conclusively shows that Donald Trump committed high crimes and misdemeanors, and that the threshold for impeachment has been met. At the State Department and at the United Nations, I saw how corrupt politicians across the globe undermined their countries’ democracies for personal and political gain. That’s why I know that it is critical for the health of our democracy and our standing in the world that we send a clear message that no one – not even the President – is above the law.
It is with solemnity and clarity that I support the President’s impeachment.
The House did their job, and now it’s time for the Senate to do theirs – to hold a fair trial and, ultimately, to remove Donald Trump from office. Sign your name if you believe the same.
SIGN YOUR NAME
Last week, Mitch McConnell announced that he will be “coordinating with the White House” as the Senate takes over impeachment proceedings. But we can’t give up hope. We need to stand together and say with one voice that the majority of Americans support and believe in our Constitution. Stand with me today and demand the Senate uphold their Constitutional oath and remove Donald Trump from office.
SIGN YOUR NAME
In solidarity,
Sara Jacobs

Right now, we face diplomatic and military uncertainty in the Middle East.
Senate Republicans and Democrats alike are dissatisfied with the White House briefing they received on Iran.
The House has voted on a war powers resolution.
Today, I'm thinking about these issues through my lens as a cybersecurity professional.
Odds are that a cyber-attack from Iran today would not likely be crippling, but this one-on-one approach is not a realistic assessment of what is at stake in cyber warfare. Attacks never come one at a time. Rather, in every second of every day our government, businesses, schools, medical centers, libraries, and homes receive millions of potential attacks generated from automated programs from nation-states as well as organized crime.
The United States may have cyber strength today, but we must battle much of the world that seeks to bring us down. Rule of security: hit the weakest link. When one country is a target and all that needs to be done is attack the weakest link, those challenges cannot be reduced to one country, one attack.
Cyber is different from conventional warfare. Taking the realities of that world into account leads to this conclusion: The United States must lead in diplomacy as well as in cybersecurity technologies. A first strike policy contradicts that sound strategy, and, ultimately, risks our national security.
If elected, I would be the only person in Congress, Democrat or Republican, with a background in internet policy and cybersecurity. With your help, I want to protect our country, maintain our economic viability, reinforce the integrity of our elections, defend our schools and teach our children how to use the internet safely. But in order to get there, I need your help! Please donate today?

Alex,
The urgency of beating Donald Trump and the GOP this November is growing with each passing day.
Our corrupt president is now working through Attorney General Barr to prevent the Department of Justice from investigating and prosecuting his, his family’s, and his friends’ crimes. He’s retaliating against whistleblowers, firing Inspectors General, fomenting racism, and stoking culture wars.

The urgency of beating Donald Trump and the GOP this November is growing with each passing day.
Our corrupt president is now working through Attorney General Barr to prevent the Department of Justice from investigating and prosecuting his, his family’s, and his friends’ crimes.

Dear Alex,
Liberal politicians’ bad decisions are now putting our safety at risk. Last year, law enforcement, district attorneys and community leaders spoke out against the radical policy to enact cashless bail in New York state. They were ignored.
Now our communities are less safe. Almost every day there is another story of a person accused of a serious crime being let out on bail without having to post bond. None is more outrageous than the tragic death of Rosie Osai on Christmas Eve, and the subsequent release of the illegal alien charged with her death.
If we can’t rely on our elected officials to keep us safe, it is time to send them home and elect new leaders who will. My opponent, Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney, is a strong supporter of ending cash bail. You can hear him say so himself in the video below.
Maloney: Ending Cash Bail &quot;Top Priority&quot;
Now that people are being let out into our communities to strike again, where is Sean Maloney? Nowhere to be found. It is time to send him home.
I won’t hide. I will speak out against bad policies. And I will fight to keep our communities safe. Please join me in helping send Sean Maloney home by
donating to my campaign today.

Facebook Join My List Logo
Dear Alex,
Sean Maloney has become a certified member of The Swamp. This shows he’s either out of touch with our Hudson Valley values or no longer cares.
Maloney clearly hasn’t gotten over the fact that his impeachment investigation failed to find a crime. So rather than move on and get to work on solving problems that matter to us, he’s lashing out and blaming any Senator who disagreed with him. But don’t be fooled by Maloney’s motives.
Maloney engaged in the swamp game himself last week:
1) go on a liberal, cable TV show on MSNBC;
2) throw out charges like authoritarianism and attack Republican Senators up for re-election; and
3) turn around and use the video to raise thousands of dollars from the members of The Resistance for your own campaign.
Watch the video of Maloney on Lawrence O’Donnell’s show.
Rep Sean Maloney Can't Let Impeachment Go
Within 24 hours of that appearance, Maloney sent out an email highlighting his hit job to raise money.
Alex, Sean Maloney tries to tell us he’s a centrist. The truth is he’s abandoned us to curry favor with liberal donors across the nation to fund his campaign. I’m running for Congress to represent you. I can’t, nor would I want to, leverage my office to benefit my political needs. So I’m counting on you to help me fight back against Maloney’s swamp tactics by chipping in even $5 now.
Chip in $5

Facebook Join My List Logo
Dear Alex,
President George W. Bush stood on the rubble of the Twin Towers and grabbed a bullhorn to speak over the noise of that moment with force and clarity. President Bush’s words rang true that day: “I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.”
As Americans, all of us were united in the fight for freedom, to protect our values and our way of life, to rid the world of terrorism.
It is in the memory of those who died that day that we built monuments to their bravery. They stand as a tribute to the sacrifice and greatness of our unity and our values. Every year on 9/11 we promise to remember and never forget.
We need to remember that, more than ever, because somehow the radical mob thinks it’s now okay to destroy these monuments. While protesting is a fundamental American right, vandalism, violence and lawlessness is never acceptable.
I was heartbroken to learn the news that a band of criminals would damage the Washingtonville World Trade Center Memorial this past week. These thugs must be found and prosecuted for their crimes. In the meantime, I’m inspired by the community members who are stepping up to protect the monument.
The radical left is about destruction with no plan to replace what they destroy with anything better. It is the prevalence of that agenda that motivated me to create my petition [[URL REDACTED]] If we allow them to continue, we run the risk of losing our freedoms, our way of life and our country.
Let’s unite,

That's why I am calling on Attorney General William Barr to resign immediately.
Please add your voice to the more than 40,361 Americans that have already called on him to resign.
Demand that Barr resign
Barr claims to be independent from Donald Trump. But, as we saw with his recent interference in the Roger Stone case, the truth is very different.
The facts?
* Roger Stone is guilty, and the career prosecutors on his case recommended a specific sentence for the crimes committed.
* Then, Trump whined publicly (via Twitter, of course) that his friend was being treated unfairly.
* The result? Barr jumped into action, working to secure a lighter sentence for a key Trump ally.
This is absolutely unacceptable. We cannot have the rule of law change at the whim of Trump's Twitter rants.
And that comes after he misled the American people about what was in the Mueller report. He has violated the promise he made during his confirmation hearing to ""keep the enforcement process sacrosanct from political influence.""
Because he clearly is willing to sacrifice the independence of our professional prosecutors in the service of Donald Trump and his allies, he is unfit to serve as Attorney General.
Sign the petition and let's make sure we're heard: William Barr must resign now.

499,"Today, I voted to acquit President Donald Trump on both articles of impeachment in the United States Senate. [[URL REDACTED]]
Dear Alex,
Today, I voted to acquit President Donald Trump on both articles of impeachment in the United States Senate.
First, I am glad the Senate soundly rejected impeachment and did not remove President Trump from office.
The articles of impeachment brought to the Senate from the Democrats in the House of Representatives represent an assault on the presidency itself and the weaponization of impeachment as a political tool.
I also believe that the impeachment effort was driven by a level of partisanship and 'Ends Justify the Means' behavior the American people have rejected.
The proper way to end this matter was a vote to acquit and allow the American people to vote for or against President Trump in November – not to remove him from office and prevent him from running for reelection.
Finally, I have detailed my views below if you want additional information about how I reached my decision on this important vote.
Sincerely,
Lindsey Graham
Lindsey Graham
United States Senator
* * *
THE PROCESS USED IN THE HOUSE TO CONSTRUCT THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT WAS FLAWED:
I feel compelled to condemn the impeachment process used in the House of Representatives because I believe it was devoid of basic, fundamental due process.
This impeachment was completed within 78 days and had a spirit of partisanship and revenge that, if accepted by the Senate, would lead to the weaponization of impeachment against future presidents.
In the House of Representatives:
* President Trump was entirely shut out of the evidence gathering stage in the House Intelligence Committee.
* President Trump was denied the right to counsel, right to cross-examine, and right to call witnesses.
* Much of the evidence gathered against President Trump by the House Intelligence Committee consisted of inadmissible hearsay.
* The House Judiciary Committee Impeachment hearings were, for lack of a better term, a sham.
More importantly, during the Senate trial the House managers admitted the reason they did not seek testimony from President Trump's closest advisers – former National Security Adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney – was because it would have required them to go to court and slowed their effort to impeach President Trump before the presidential election began.
It was a calculated decision to deal the courts out of President Trump's impeachment inquiry due to a political timetable.
With today's Senate vote to acquit President Trump, I hope the Senate has sent a clear message that this should never, ever happen again.
THE CASE AGAINST THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT:
As to the substance of the allegations against President Trump:
The Obstruction of Congress article is literally impeaching the President because he chose to follow the advice of the White House Counsel, the Department of Justice and was willing to use constitutional privileges in a manner consistent with every other president.
This article should be soundly rejected, not only in this case, but also in the future. Whether one likes President Trump or not, he is the president and has privileges attached to his office. To impeach him for exercising those privileges is unprecedented.
The Abuse of Power article of impeachment is beyond vague, does not allege criminal misconduct, and requires the Senate to engage in a subjective analysis of President Trump's motives and actions. It also represents an existential threat to the presidency.
The House managers argued the sole and exclusive purpose of freezing aid to Ukraine was for the private, political benefit of President Trump. It is clear to me that there is ample evidence that the actions of Hunter Biden and Vice President Biden were inappropriate and undercut American foreign policy.
Moreover, there was evidence in the record that officials in Ukraine were actively speaking against candidate Trump and were pulling for former Secretary of State Clinton. Based on the overwhelming amount of evidence of inappropriate behavior by the Bidens and statements by State Department officials about certain Ukrainians' beliefs that one American candidate would be better than the other would, I found it eminently reasonable for the President to be concerned about corruption in Ukraine, election interference, and the behavior of Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter.
It remains hard for me to believe that Vice President Biden was an effective messenger for reform efforts in Ukraine while his son Hunter was receiving $3 million from Burisma, one of Ukraine's most corrupt companies.
It is obvious to me that after the Mueller Report, President Trump viewed the House impeachment inquiry as a gross double standard when it comes to investigations. The House launched an investigation into his phone call with President Zelensky. At the same time, the House showed no interest in the actions of Vice President Biden and Hunter Biden.
The President, in my view, was justified in asking the Ukrainians to look into the circumstances surrounding the firing of Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma, and whether his termination benefited Hunter Biden and Burisma.
It is clear to me that the phone call focused on burden sharing, corruption, and election interference in an appropriate manner. The most vexing question was how President Trump was supposed to deal with these legitimate concerns.
THE HOUSE DOUBLE STANDARD:
The House managers suggest that President Trump could not have asked the Attorney General to investigate these concerns because that would be equivalent to President Trump asking for an investigation of a political rival. However, in the next moment, the House managers declare the proper way for President Trump to deal with those allegations would have been to ask the Attorney General to investigate.
They cannot have it both ways.
I believe that it is fair to criticize President Trump's over-reliance on his private attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate alleged corruption and conflicts of interest regarding the Bidens and Burisma. However, I do not find this to be a remotely impeachable offense and believe it would be beneficial for the country to find other ways to deal with such matters in the future.
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT CASE DOES NOT MEET REMOVAL STANDARD:
Assuming the facts — in the light most favorable to the House managers – that for a period of time the aid was suspended by President Trump to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and election interference, I find both articles fail as impeachable offenses.
I find this to be the case even if we assume additional facts from Mr. Bolton are accurate.
The simple fact is the Ukrainians received the military aid and did not open the requested investigation.
The allegations contained in this impeachment are not what the Founding Fathers had in mind as high crimes or misdemeanors. Our Founding Fathers, in my view, envisioned serious, criminal misconduct that would shake the foundation of the American constitutional system.
The Nixon Impeachment had broad, bipartisan support once the facts were revealed. The Clinton Impeachment started with bipartisan support in the House and ended with bipartisan support in the Senate, even though it fell well short of the two-thirds vote required to remove a president.
I hope my decision to vote not guilty on both articles of impeachment is seen as a rejection of WHAT the House of Representatives did and HOW they did it.
To remove a President from office requires conduct that shakes the very foundation of our constitutional system.
This impeachment effort fell far short of that high standard.

The impeachment charade continues unabated today in the House Judiciary Committee. Chairman Nadler ignores the rules and precedents set over the long history of our country in order to ram fake, unsupported charges against an elected President through this kangaroo court.
At the same time, Congressional Democrats continue to prevent meaningful reform of our immigration system and a physical barrier on our southern border even as American citizens are victimized by crime, drugs, and cheap labor pouring across it.
I came to Washington to fight for our shared values.
It is now obvious that the fight will continue through 2020 and beyond.
So, with prayerful consideration, today I officially filed to run again to be the Representative for the 6th Congressional District of Texas.
Representing you with passion and wisdom is my sacred obligation, and a great honor.
Will you support me as I stand with you by contributing $25, $50, or more to my reelection campaign?
Together we can stop the impeachment charade and take real action at the border.
With so many big issues at stake…USMCA, trade, prescription drugs, taxes, and debt…it is insane for the Democrats to focus on trying to undo an election.
That is why I keep fighting: to support President Trump’s policies and protect his reforms from the radical left that seeks to unmake the progress of the last three years.

Dear Friend,
The impeachment sham trial is just getting underway and after being denied due process by Nancy Pelosi, the President will finally have a chance to defend himself.
I hope you agree with me that the President’s team of legal experts are correct: These charges are constitutionally invalid because no crime has actually been committed.
The Democrats have no case and this has been a political witch hunt since the beginning. This entire hoax has been a waste of time and taxpayer dollars and Americans are tired of it.
It is more important than ever to take back the majority from Nancy Pelosi and I’m counting on you to help me do it.

Friend --
On Tuesday, Fulton County (GA) District Attorney announced criminal charges for the two police officers involved in the shooting death of Rayshard Brooks, the young black man found sleeping in his car at a Wendy's parking lot in Atlanta.
In protest, their fellow Atlanta police officers called out of their shifts. As a result, more than 65 police calls were ignored or delayed because of the callouts. While there weren't any serious crimes that occurred during their absence, this display of protest by officers continues to demonstrate the current issues with policing in America.
Simply put, this is unacceptable!
The lives of law enforcement officers are changing, and change is difficult. However, these changes are necessary to protect the most vulnerable around us.
This is why it's important to have leaders supporting reforms like the Justice in Policing Act of 2020 being pushed through the House.
Unfortunately, our representative Randy Weber, along with 19 other house republicans, have co-sponsored a resolution opposing all reforms to policing in America.
We are two and a half weeks out from the next FEC deadline, and it's important we send a message to Rep. Weber and the status quo that change is coming to TX-14.
Can I count on your support with a contribution of $50 to ensure our voices are heard in Washington?
I need you,
~ Adrienne

503,"At the end of the day, this trial is about doing what’s right for the American people.
Friend, I’m really disturbed by what I’ve seen of the impeachment trial so far. Senate Republicans were united in blocking the admittance of key witness testimonies – even though a new poll shows nearly three quarters of Americans believe those witnesses should be allowed to speak.
I have a hunch you’re ticked off, too – so I wanted to bump this back up to the top of your inbox. At the end of the day, this trial is about doing what’s right for the American people. So I’m asking 895 more supporters to make their voices heard before midnight tonight:
Should the Senate impeachment trial include witness testimony?
YES
NO
Thanks,

Subject: Your opinion on the impeachment trial:
Wendy Davis for Congress
Friend: For only the third time in our nation’s history, a presidential impeachment trial is underway in the Senate. Each U.S. senator took a solemn oath to serve as an impartial juror as they consider convicting Donald Trump of high crimes and misdemeanors.
But to execute the role of impartial juror, the Senate must receive full evidence of the president’s behavior. Sadly, Mitch McConnell is turning his back on the oath he swore – and turning his back on our Constitution – by not allowing for new witness testimony.
Is denying the American people the full truth really the standard for a fair and impartial trial? Moments like these test our country’s character – and right now, Mitch McConnell is failing. I don’t want my grandbabies to grow up in a world where their leaders take the easy way out – and that’s why, together, we must demand better from the Senate.
I’m counting on 2,700 supporters – including you – to make your voices heard on the impeachment trial before midnight. Speak out against Mitch McConnell by answering the following question:
Should the Senate allow witness testimony in the impeachment trial?
YES
NO
Thank you,

504,"This is a pandemic, not political theater
Wendy Davis for Congress
Friend, more than 6,000 Texans have already lost their lives to COVID-19. Last week, FEMA refrigerator trucks were delivered here because many of our morgues have run out of room to store the bodies of those who have lost their battle with this devastating virus. This is the very definition of a crisis, and it's happening here in our own backyard.
And yet what has Donald Trump's response been? Attacking the person actually trying to do something about it.
Dr. Anthony Fauci has been telling us hard truths since the start of this pandemic. He's the guy that puts science first – and he's not afraid to stand up to this administration when they're behaving in ways that put our lives in danger.
But Trump has repeatedly denied the science and discredited Dr. Fauci. Worse still? He's got rank-and-file Republicans like Chip Roy backing him up. Chip went on the offensive against a Republican congresswoman who spoke out in support of Dr. Fauci – as if trusting one of the world's experts on infectious diseases is some sort of political crime.
This is a pandemic, not political theater. So I'm calling on Donald Trump and Chip Roy to depoliticize this crisis and stop the attacks on Dr. Fauci – and I'm asking 585 concerned people like you to join me before midnight tonight.
Add your name right now: Tell Donald Trump and Chip Roy to stop the attacks on Dr. Fauci!

Really appreciate it,

Wendy Davis for Congress
Friend,
Today, the House of Representatives voted to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate – where they'll debate whether to convict Donald Trump of high crimes and misdemeanors.
Moments like these test our country's character: Will we stand up and do the right thing, even when it's hard? Or will we take the easy way out? My opponent, Rep. Chip Roy, took the easy way out. He voted to protect a president who undermined our national security for personal and political gain – putting his party before his country.
I don't want my grandbabies to grow up in a world where their leaders take the easy way out. That's why, when I was first sworn into the Fort Worth City Council, I made a promise to myself that I would always vote my conscience – even when it means speaking truth to power.
On this historic day for our nation, I want to know what your conscience is telling you. I'm hoping to hear from 3,200 supporters, including you, before midnight, so please respond now:
Should the Senate convict Donald Trump?
YES
NO
Thank you for speaking out.

What's happened to our district under Maxine's watch is the same thing that will happen to the rest of the country if we let her and her radical allies take control and implement their socialist and lawless agenda.

TRUMP PENCE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
BREAKING: Joe Biden picks PHONY Kamala Harris as running mate.
Friend,
Wow.
Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn't get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?).
Next, she ends her pathetic run at President.
Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP.
And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it's obvious that this radical duo is PERFECT for each other but WRONG for America.
They are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working tirelessly to restore LAW AND ORDER.

I’m the Republican nominee taking on Maxine Waters, but as a black man I’m not your typical Republican.

HELP JOE DEFEAT MAXINE »
I grew up in South-Central Los Angeles in the district Maxine is supposed to – but refuses to – represent in Congress.
Maxine’s policies are responsible for the poverty, crime and violence that plague our community... they’re responsible for the drive-by shooting that left bullet holes in my family’s windows and sofa when I was young.
After serving my country in the U.S. Navy, which included a combat tour as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, I have decided to serve my community and my country again and rescue us from Maxine Waters.
But to achieve this, I need help from other conservative patriots, like you.
Our campaign has already raised over $3 million to defeat Maxine. Victory is within grasp, but it’s going to take continued effort and support from every corner of the nation to kick her out of office after more than four decades.
Will you support our grassroots campaign with a contribution of $25 or more and help this black conservative Navy veteran defeat radical socialist Maxine Waters?

512,"ROGER STONE
Dear Alex,
I have shocking news. It is truly a life or death situation. Let me explain. My family and I are still in shock.
As you know, back in January I was the victim of a political hit-job by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’ Witch Hunt and was convicted on totally fabricated charges of lying to Congress by a vicious Obama appointed Left-wing Judge, a stacked jury of all Trump-hating Democrats and a corrupt Jury Forewoman.
I was essentially prosecuted because I refused under enormous legal and financial pressure to lie and become a witness against the President who I have known for 40 years and who I spoke to on the phone throughout his historic 2016 Campaign. Mueller’s Dirty Cops had the records of all those phone calls and wanted me to lie about what was discussed in order to impeach the President. I refused.
I was convicted in this political lynching and sentence to almost four years in prison plus two years of supervised probation. I immediately filed a notice of appeal based on the blatant misconduct of the Jury Forewoman. That appeal-if I live long enough to see it through- could take over a year and cost $1 million.
Here is the shocking news- Last week the US Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice told us that Attorney General Barr’s directives to the BOP that inmates convicted of non-violent crimes be transferred from prison to home confinement applies to Democrat super-lawyer Michael Avenatti who was convicted of stealing $25 million from his clients and still faces trial on additional charges, Rick Gates the former Trump campaign official who lied in his testimony against me at my trial and Michael Cohen, the former Trump lawyer who was found guilty of criminal fraud and multiple million dollar tax-evasion and then made a deal to testify against the President\- but NOT to Roger Stone. All these anti-Trump criminals have been released to home confinement.
Rather than home confinement, as ABC news reported today, I have been ordered to surrender to a COVID-19 infested prison in Georgia in just nine days. At 67 years old and with a lifelong history of asthma this is a DEATH SENTENCE!
Here is the proof that I am days away from going to this dangerous prison far from my home and family.
Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Georgia in recent weeks The Prison facility in Jessup has several confirmed cases, awaits tests results of 23 more inmates with symptom and has yet to even test some 1400 other inmates. USA Today reported last week that the BOP handling of COVID-19 has been a disaster and that there is evidence that they are misleading the public about how may cases they really have.
I have no choice but to file an EMERGENCY MOTION with the court that includes my medical records and extensive information from my doctor in a last-minute effort to extend my surrender date at least until the coronavirus crisis in our prisons has passed. We have 24 hours to do that.
This is a LIFE AND DEATH situation. It is clear that the Deep State wants to kill me because I refused to turn on the President and to avenge the 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton.
PLEASE GIVE TO THE STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
President Trump himself has said my trial and conviction was a “miscarriage of Justice” that I was treated “very unfairly” and that my trial was “disgraceful”. I have said openly that I am praying for a commutation of my sentence while my appeal plays out, or even a pardon, but I cannot do that until I have exhausted every legal remedy myself. With this legal motion I will have done so.
I have instructed my new appeals lawyers to prepare a motion challenging this dangerous situation to file in court IMMEDIATELY though I am skeptical about getting a fair ruling from this Judge. My health issues are very real as are the dangers of COVID-19. I don’t understand why I should be treated differently than Avenatti, Cohen, Gates and many others.
My personal physician was contacted just before the weekend and he went to the office Saturday to pulled together all of the records, lab tests and studies that show that a person at my age and in my condition will be highly susceptible to Coronavirus.
But I cannot file this emergency motion in court without your help. We literally don’t have a minute to lose.
As of today, I do not have enough in my STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND to fully pay my lawyers for the complicated legal work that is being done to save me from dying in a coronavirus infested hellhole including the possibility of an emergency appeal to the DC Court of Appeals if Judge Amy Berman Jackson denies me a delay- which based on history is likely.
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
Remember this must all happen in the next NINE days! My wife and family are petrified that I will die of COVID-19 before the election and are outraged by this unfair and unequal treatment!
I am trying to calm them down but I must hear from you.
I know you have been supportive in the past, contributing to help fund my legal defense in what turned out to be an outrageous Soviet-style Show trial in DC last January or signing a petition to the President for Clemency. Can I count on you?
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
This entire horrible ordeal where the legal costs have bankrupted me, the Fake News media has smeared me and the stress of fighting the dirty tactics of Robert Mueller’s now thoroughly discredited Witch-hunt has just worn me down. My wife Nydia now suffers from Rheumatoid Arthritis – Brought on by the stress I am convinced. We are struggling to keep a roof over or head and groceries on the table but I no regrets about my decision to refuse to bare false witness against the President in order to ease the contrived legal danger to myself.
It is only the reaffirmation of my Christian faith in God at the recommendation of Rev. Franklin Graham last January that has given me strength and resolve in this fight for my freedom.
The end is near. Whether I live or die will be decided in the next nine days. I would pay for this myself but I literally have nothing. Please send my Stone Defense Fund whatever you can today.
God Bless You,
Roger Stone
PS -I cannot formally apply for Clemency- either a commutation of sentence or pardon from President Trump, until my legal motions are heard before the trial court and potentially the DC Court of appeals and my legal remedies are exhausted so I need to hear from you today.

Mansion Maxine
Maxine Waters has ""represented"" Los Angeles for 44 years, but things are so bad here that even she refuses to live in our district.
While Maxine sits in her out-of-district mansion, the rest of us have to live with the crime, violence, drugs, poverty and homelessness that her decades of failed radical policies have created.
I'm running for Congress to undo the mess that Maxine Waters has created, and I need your help to defeat her in just a few weeks.
Will you help me kick Maxine Waters out of Congress and fight for safe streets and a strong economy by chipping in $25, $50, $100 or more now?
HELP JOE DEFEAT MAXINE »
When I turned 18, I joined the U.S. Navy. During my service, I was deployed to a combat zone during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
But while I was away serving my country and fighting in a war, Maxine Waters couldn't even be bothered to fight for our own community. So when I returned home from war, it was our district that looked like a war zone.
Los Angeles deserves better! America deserves better!
I need your help to hold Maxine Waters accountable for her failed soclialist policies, fix the mess she's created in our community, and ensure what has happened in Los Angeles doesn't happen to the rest of our country.
With just weeks left until Election Day, will you chip in $25, $50, $100 or even more to help me defeat Maxine Waters and restore responsible leadership in Congress?

Alex,
Maxine Waters is “overjoyed” that racist Joe Biden picked her buddy Kamala Harris to be his running mate, and we shouldn’t be surprised.
Maxine and Kamala are both radical liberals from California cities – Los Angeles and San Francisco – that their failed socialist and corrupt policies have turned into epicenters for homelessness, poverty, crime, high taxation, and high cost of living.

Help Joe defeat Maxine →
As a black conservative Navy veteran from South-Central Los Angeles, I have what it takes to finally kick Maxine Waters out of Congress.
I spent 13 years in the United States Navy – including a combat tour during Operation Iraqi Freedom – which taught me the importance of integrity, hard work and service to country ... things Maxine Waters absolutely does not comprehend.
She has completely ignored her crumbling district while spending all her time and energy on viciously attacking President Trump and, lately, aggressively pressuring Biden to pick her buddy Kamala as his running mate.
Radical California liberals like Maxine Waters, Pelosi, Schiff and now Kamala Harris have taken over the Democratic Party, and they're working together to push the same failed policies that have destroyed California, only on a national scale.
Maxine Waters is a ringleader of this new regime, and we need to remove her from Congress now before it’s too late.
We have less than three months until the election, so please chip in $10, $25, $50 or even $100 or more to help us push toward the finish line and defeat radical leftist Maxine Waters.

515,"While Maxine Waters is hiding from me, she’s sending gangsters and thugs to my events to harass me and my supporters. Joe Collins for Congress
Alex, Maxine Waters is hiding from me.
As the Republican nominee running against radical leftist Maxine, I publicly challenged her to a debate at the beginning of the month.
Typical of a 40+ year career politician who has done NOTHING to help her crumbing district, she has ignored my challenge.
But while Maxine Waters is hiding from me, she’s sending gangsters and thugs to my events to harass me and my supporters.
I need your help to flush radical, cowardly Maxine Waters out of hiding and hold her accountable for her failed socialist policies. Please chip in $250, $100, $50 or even just $25 or $10 to support my campaign and help me defeat Maxine.
Flush Maxine out »
Maxine Waters doesn’t care about our community, and she certainly doesn’t care about black lives.
She’s getting rich off of making a career out of viscously attacking President Trump and conservatives like you and me.
Meanwhile, her failed socialist policies have only resulted in more poverty, joblessness, homelessness, crime and violence in our district.
That’s what Maxine Waters has done to my home, and that’s what she’ll do to the rest of the country if we don’t remove her from office – which is why I need your support today.
Maxine Waters needs to face me and her constituents and answer for her failures. I need your help to flush Maxine out of hiding and force her to debate me – then I need your help to defeat her.
For the good of our country, help me hold radical Maxine Waters accountable by making a contribution of $250, $100, $50 or even $25, $10 or another amount today.
Flush Maxine out »
We can’t let Maxine Waters and her agenda continue to destroy our country. Please do whatever you can to help me defeat her.

TRUMP PENCE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
BREAKING: Joe Biden picks PHONY Kamala Harris as running mate.
Friend,
Wow.
Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn’t get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?).
Next, she ends her pathetic run at President.
Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP.
And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it’s obvious that this radical duo is PERFECT for each other but WRONG for America.
They are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working tirelessly to restore LAW AND ORDER.
It’s going to be up to Patriots like YOU to save our Nation from that dark fate, Friend. Election Day is right around the corner, and now that we know what we’re up against, I’m going to do something HUGE:

Alex,
I am used to getting attacked by the mainstream media and the Left. But this is something new.
I’ve been running ads in swing states to make sure voters know that a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for chaos, crime, and open borders. Joe Biden has turned his campaign platform over to Bernie Sanders and Joe would rather hide out in his basement than face the voters.

I’m all in to help my friend and great American, Alek Skarlatos. Alek is running for Congress in Oregon against career politician and far-left radical, Peter DeFazio.
Peter DeFazio thinks that the Green New Deal is a great idea, he supports open borders, and he’s soft on crime.
Alek stopped a terrorist attack on a Paris-bound train in 2015. In 2020, he stood up to radicalism once again on the streets of Portland during the recent riots.
Alek is a fighter and the Democrats are playing dirty to defeat him. I am lending my support to Alek right now. I need more enthusiastic conservatives in Washington to fight with me, and that’s why I need Alek Skarlatos in Congress.
Will you help me get this fighter to Congress by pitching in $15, $25, $50 or even more right now?

521,"ROGER STONE
Dear Friend,
I have shocking news. It is truly a life or death situation. Let me explain. My family and I are still in shock.
As you know, back in January I was the victim of a political hit-job by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’ Witch Hunt and was convicted on totally fabricated charges of lying to Congress by a vicious Obama appointed Left-wing Judge, a stacked jury of all Trump-hating Democrats and a corrupt Jury Forewoman.
I was essentially prosecuted because I refused under enormous legal and financial pressure to lie and become a witness against the President who I have known for 40 years and who I spoke to on the phone throughout his historic 2016 Campaign. Mueller’s Dirty Cops had the records of all those phone calls and wanted me to lie about what was discussed in order to impeach the President. I refused.
I was convicted in this political lynching and sentence to almost four years in prison plus two years of supervised probation. I immediately filed a notice of appeal based on the blatant misconduct of the Jury Forewoman. That appeal-if I live long enough to see it through- could take over a year and cost $1 million.
Here is the shocking news- Last week the US Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice told us that Attorney General Barr’s directives to the BOP that inmates convicted of non-violent crimes be transferred from prison to home confinement applies to Democrat super-lawyer Michael Avenatti who was convicted of stealing $25 million from his clients and still faces trial on additional charges, Rick Gates the former Trump campaign official who lied in his testimony against me at my trial and Michael Cohen, the former Trump lawyer who was found guilty of criminal fraud and multiple million dollar tax-evasion and then made a deal to testify against the President\- but NOT to Roger Stone. All these anti-Trump criminals have been released to home confinement.
Rather than home confinement, as ABC news reported today, I have been ordered to surrender to a COVID-19 infested prison in Georgia in just nine days. At 67 years old and with a lifelong history of asthma this is a DEATH SENTENCE!
Here is the proof that I am days away from going to this dangerous prison far from my home and family.
Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Georgia in recent weeks The Prison facility in Jessup has several confirmed cases, awaits tests results of 23 more inmates with symptom and has yet to even test some 1400 other inmates. USA Today reported last week that the BOP handling of COVID-19 has been a disaster and that there is evidence that they are misleading the public about how may cases they really have.
I have no choice but to file an EMERGENCY MOTION with the court that includes my medical records and extensive information from my doctor in a last-minute effort to extend my surrender date at least until the coronavirus crisis in our prisons has passed. We have 24 hours to do that.
This is a LIFE AND DEATH situation. It is clear that the Deep State wants to kill me because I refused to turn on the President and to avenge the 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton.
PLEASE GIVE TO THE STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
President Trump himself has said my trial and conviction was a “miscarriage of Justice” that I was treated “very unfairly” and that my trial was “disgraceful”. I have said openly that I am praying for a commutation of my sentence while my appeal plays out, or even a pardon, but I cannot do that until I have exhausted every legal remedy myself. With this legal motion I will have done so.
I have instructed my new appeals lawyers to prepare a motion challenging this dangerous situation to file in court IMMEDIATELY though I am skeptical about getting a fair ruling from this Judge. My health issues are very real as are the dangers of COVID-19. I don’t understand why I should be treated differently than Avenatti, Cohen, Gates and many others.
My personal physician was contacted just before the weekend and he went to the office Saturday to pulled together all of the records, lab tests and studies that show that a person at my age and in my condition will be highly susceptible to Coronavirus.
But I cannot file this emergency motion in court without your help. We literally don’t have a minute to lose.
As of today, I do not have enough in my STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND to fully pay my lawyers for the complicated legal work that is being done to save me from dying in a coronavirus infested hellhole including the possibility of an emergency appeal to the DC Court of Appeals if Judge Amy Berman Jackson denies me a delay- which based on history is likely.
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
Remember this must all happen in the next NINE days! My wife and family are petrified that I will die of COVID-19 before the election and are outraged by this unfair and unequal treatment!
I am trying to calm them down but I must hear from you.
I know you have been supportive in the past, contributing to help fund my legal defense in what turned out to be an outrageous Soviet-style Show trial in DC last January or signing a petition to the President for Clemency. Can I count on you?
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
This entire horrible ordeal where the legal costs have bankrupted me, the Fake News media has smeared me and the stress of fighting the dirty tactics of Robert Mueller’s now thoroughly discredited Witch-hunt has just worn me down. My wife Nydia now suffers from Rheumatoid Arthritis – Brought on by the stress I am convinced. We are struggling to keep a roof over or head and groceries on the table but I no regrets about my decision to refuse to bare false witness against the President in order to ease the contrived legal danger to myself.
It is only the reaffirmation of my Christian faith in God at the recommendation of Rev. Franklin Graham last January that has given me strength and resolve in this fight for my freedom.
The end is near. Whether I live or die will be decided in the next nine days. I would pay for this myself but I literally have nothing. Please send my Stone Defense Fund whatever you can today.
God Bless You,
Roger Stone
PS -I cannot formally apply for Clemency- either a commutation of sentence or pardon from President Trump, until my legal motions are heard before the trial court and potentially the DC Court of appeals and my legal remedies are exhausted so I need to hear from you today.

When I turned 18, I joined the U.S. Navy. During my service, I was deployed to a combat zone during Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Los Angeles deserves better! America deserves better!
I need your help to hold Maxine Waters accountable for her failed soclialist policies, fix the mess she's created in our community, and ensure what has happened in Los Angeles doesn't happen to the rest of our country.

What's happened to our district under Maxine's watch is the same thing that will happen to the rest of the country if we let her and her radical allies take control and implement their socialist and lawless agenda.

Alex,
I’m the Republican nominee taking on Maxine Waters, but as a black man I’m not your typical Republican.
I am determined to defeat Maxine because I have witnessed firsthand how her radical socialist policies have failed and even destroyed my community. I refuse to let her destroy the rest of our country.
HELP JOE DEFEAT MAXINE »
I grew up in South-Central Los Angeles in the district Maxine is supposed to – but refuses to – represent in Congress.
Maxine’s policies are responsible for the poverty, crime and violence that plague our community... they’re responsible for the drive-by shooting that left bullet holes in my family’s windows and sofa when I was young.
After serving my country in the U.S. Navy, which included a combat tour as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, I have decided to serve my community and my country again and rescue us from Maxine Waters.
But to achieve this, I need help from other conservative patriots, like you.
Our campaign has already raised over $3 million to defeat Maxine. Victory is within grasp, but it’s going to take continued effort and support from every corner of the nation to kick her out of office after more than four decades.
Will you support our grassroots campaign with a contribution of $25 or more and help this black conservative Navy veteran defeat radical socialist Maxine Waters?
DEFEAT MAXINE »
Maxine is not only a failure; she is openly hateful toward conservatives like you and me and has dedicated her entire attention to trying to impeach our President rather than serving her constituents.

526,"Biden's VP pick | Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn't get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
TRUMP PENCE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
BREAKING: Joe Biden picks PHONY Kamala Harris as running mate.
Friend,
Wow.
Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn't get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?).
Next, she ends her pathetic run at President.
Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP.
And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it's obvious that this radical duo is PERFECT for each other but WRONG for America.
They are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working tirelessly to restore LAW AND ORDER.

Alex,
I have a serious question for you...
Do you want the rest of America to look like the liberal-controlled, crime-ridden, impoverished, freedomless, feces-covered streets of San Francisco and Los Angeles?
...I didn’t think so.
But the liberal politicians who control these derelict cities are already controlling the House of Representatives – Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and Maxine Waters. And now they’re trying to elect San Francisco’s Kamala Harris as VP.
I’m Joe Collins – a black conservative Navy veteran from South Central Los Angeles – and I am the Republican nominee running for Congress against one of these radical leftists: Maxine Waters.
To defeat Maxine and stop California Democrats’ radical takeover of America, I need your support. Please rush $25 or more to my campaign today.
DEFEAT MAXINE: CHIP IN »
Maxine’s failed policies and ignorance of her constituents have already destroyed Los Angeles. I am running not only to save my home, but also to prevent what the Democrats have done to us from happening to the rest of my country.
We've already proven we have what it takes to defeat Maxine, and for the first time in her 40+ years as a liberal politician we have her scared.
But with less than 45 days until voting by mail in my race begins – and as a fellow pratriot who is also fighting to protect our country from the Left's radical agenda – I need your help today.
Please chip in $25 or more right now to defeat Maxine Waters and save America from the destructive, radical, socialist agenda that she, Pelosi, Schiff and Kamala Harris are planning to unleash nationwide.

Alex,
Recently declassified documents revealed the full scope of the crimes committed by the Obama administration and the Deep State to take down Trump's Presidency. Their barbaric treatment of General Flynn is just the tip of the iceberg.
Democrats and NeverTrump radicals have undermined our Democratic institutions going after President Trump and his supporters. And they’ve been able to get away with it because of their hold on the House Majority.
If they take this seat in November, our goal of taking back the House Majority and stopping the illegal witch hunts is almost impossible. That’s why Nancy Pelosi and NeverTrumpers across the Country are spending millions to defeat me.
If you want these attacks on President Trump and his supporters to stop so he can focus on putting America First, hurry over a donation to stop Nancy Pelosi from stealing this seat.

533,"ROGER STONE
Dear Alex,
I have shocking news. It is truly a life or death situation. Let me explain. My family and I are still in shock.
As you know, back in January I was the victim of a political hit-job by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’ Witch Hunt and was convicted on totally fabricated charges of lying to Congress by a vicious Obama appointed Left-wing Judge, a stacked jury of all Trump-hating Democrats and a corrupt Jury Forewoman.
I was essentially prosecuted because I refused under enormous legal and financial pressure to lie and become a witness against the President who I have known for 40 years and who I spoke to on the phone throughout his historic 2016 Campaign. Mueller’s Dirty Cops had the records of all those phone calls and wanted me to lie about what was discussed in order to impeach the President. I refused.
I was convicted in this political lynching and sentence to almost four years in prison plus two years of supervised probation. I immediately filed a notice of appeal based on the blatant misconduct of the Jury Forewoman. That appeal-if I live long enough to see it through- could take over a year and cost $1 million.
Here is the shocking news- Last week the US Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice told us that Attorney General Barr’s directives to the BOP that inmates convicted of non-violent crimes be transferred from prison to home confinement applies to Democrat super-lawyer Michael Avenatti who was convicted of stealing $25 million from his clients and still faces trial on additional charges, Rick Gates the former Trump campaign official who lied in his testimony against me at my trial and Michael Cohen, the former Trump lawyer who was found guilty of criminal fraud and multiple million dollar tax-evasion and then made a deal to testify against the President\- but NOT to Roger Stone. All these anti-Trump criminals have been released to home confinement.
Rather than home confinement, as ABC news reported today, I have been ordered to surrender to a COVID-19 infested prison in Georgia in just nine days. At 67 years old and with a lifelong history of asthma this is a DEATH SENTENCE!
Here is the proof that I am days away from going to this dangerous prison far from my home and family.
Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Georgia in recent weeks The Prison facility in Jessup has several confirmed cases, awaits tests results of 23 more inmates with symptom and has yet to even test some 1400 other inmates. USA Today reported last week that the BOP handling of COVID-19 has been a disaster and that there is evidence that they are misleading the public about how may cases they really have.
I have no choice but to file an EMERGENCY MOTION with the court that includes my medical records and extensive information from my doctor in a last-minute effort to extend my surrender date at least until the coronavirus crisis in our prisons has passed. We have 24 hours to do that.
This is a LIFE AND DEATH situation. It is clear that the Deep State wants to kill me because I refused to turn on the President and to avenge the 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton.
PLEASE GIVE TO THE STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
President Trump himself has said my trial and conviction was a “miscarriage of Justice” that I was treated “very unfairly” and that my trial was “disgraceful”. I have said openly that I am praying for a commutation of my sentence while my appeal plays out, or even a pardon, but I cannot do that until I have exhausted every legal remedy myself. With this legal motion I will have done so.
I have instructed my new appeals lawyers to prepare a motion challenging this dangerous situation to file in court IMMEDIATELY though I am skeptical about getting a fair ruling from this Judge. My health issues are very real as are the dangers of COVID-19. I don’t understand why I should be treated differently than Avenatti, Cohen, Gates and many others.
My personal physician was contacted just before the weekend and he went to the office Saturday to pulled together all of the records, lab tests and studies that show that a person at my age and in my condition will be highly susceptible to Coronavirus.
But I cannot file this emergency motion in court without your help. We literally don’t have a minute to lose.
As of today, I do not have enough in my STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND to fully pay my lawyers for the complicated legal work that is being done to save me from dying in a coronavirus infested hellhole including the possibility of an emergency appeal to the DC Court of Appeals if Judge Amy Berman Jackson denies me a delay- which based on history is likely.
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
Remember this must all happen in the next NINE days! My wife and family are petrified that I will die of COVID-19 before the election and are outraged by this unfair and unequal treatment!
I am trying to calm them down but I must hear from you.
I know you have been supportive in the past, contributing to help fund my legal defense in what turned out to be an outrageous Soviet-style Show trial in DC last January or signing a petition to the President for Clemency. Can I count on you?
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
This entire horrible ordeal where the legal costs have bankrupted me, the Fake News media has smeared me and the stress of fighting the dirty tactics of Robert Mueller’s now thoroughly discredited Witch-hunt has just worn me down. My wife Nydia now suffers from Rheumatoid Arthritis – Brought on by the stress I am convinced. We are struggling to keep a roof over or head and groceries on the table but I no regrets about my decision to refuse to bare false witness against the President in order to ease the contrived legal danger to myself.
It is only the reaffirmation of my Christian faith in God at the recommendation of Rev. Franklin Graham last January that has given me strength and resolve in this fight for my freedom.
The end is near. Whether I live or die will be decided in the next nine days. I would pay for this myself but I literally have nothing. Please send my Stone Defense Fund whatever you can today.
God Bless You,
Roger Stone
PS -I cannot formally apply for Clemency- either a commutation of sentence or pardon from President Trump, until my legal motions are heard before the trial court and potentially the DC Court of appeals and my legal remedies are exhausted so I need to hear from you today.

Fellow Conservative:
The Democrats are trying to exploit the coronavirus crisis so they can defeat President Trump and take over the Senate in November.
They want to force their socialist agenda on America with the Green New Deal, open borders, and liberal judges.
That's why I'm writing to ask you to support my friend Senator Steve Daines, a solid conservative from Montana.
Steve Daines \(R-MT\)
Steve is tough on crime, he stands up to China, and he's against illegal immigration. He's being challenged by Governor Steve Bullock who is weak on China, weak on immigration, and weak on human life.
Please join me in supporting Steve Daines.
Senator Chuck Schumer and former President Barack Obama recruited Steve Bullock to run in this race. They know that despite Bullock's shameless attempts to portray himself as a moderate, he's truly a liberal who will help advance their socialist agenda.
Liberals know Governor Bullock...
❌ Vetoed the born-alive bill to protect babies who survive abortion
❌ Called for a ban on semi-automatic weapons
❌ Opposes the border wall
❌ Supports sanctuary cities
❌ Supports the Iran nuclear deal
❌ Supports efforts to impeach President Trump
Conservatives must work together to help Steve Daines win this important U.S. Senate race.
But it won't be easy.
Steve Bullock has massively out-raised Steve Daines with the support of liberals across the country, and now the race is statistically tied!
Democrats know that their path to the Senate Majority runs through Montana and will work very hard to win it.
If Steve Daines loses in Montana, Chuck Schumer will become Senate Majority leader and the liberal mob will have total control.
We can't allow that to happen.
Please make a generous contribution to help my friend Senator Steve Daines today.
Conservatives can win this race if we work together to make sure voters in Montana know the truth.
Thank you for considering this request and for doing so much to help fight for conservative leadership in Washington.
Sincerely,

Maxine Waters is “overjoyed” that racist Joe Biden picked her buddy Kamala Harris to be his running mate, and we shouldn’t be surprised.
Maxine and Kamala are both radical liberals from California cities – Los Angeles and San Francisco – that their failed socialist and corrupt policies have turned into epicenters for homelessness, poverty, crime, high taxation, and high cost of living.

As a black conservative Navy veteran from South-Central Los Angeles, I have what it takes to finally kick Maxine Waters out of Congress.
I spent 13 years in the United States Navy – including a combat tour during Operation Iraqi Freedom – which taught me the importance of integrity, hard work and service to country ... things Maxine Waters absolutely does not comprehend.
She has completely ignored her crumbling district while spending all her time and energy on viciously attacking President Trump and, lately, aggressively pressuring Biden to pick her buddy Kamala as his running mate.
Radical California liberals like Maxine Waters, Pelosi, Schiff and now Kamala Harris have taken over the Democratic Party, and they're working together to push the same failed policies that have destroyed California, only on a national scale.
Maxine Waters is a ringleader of this new regime, and we need to remove her from Congress now before it’s too late.
We have less than three months until the election, so please chip in $10, $25, $50 or even $100 or more to help us push toward the finish line and defeat radical leftist Maxine Waters.

Fellow Patriot, control of the U.S. Senate is at stake — and it’s critical that YOU step up to help my friend Roger Marshall defend OUR Republican majority. Can you rush a generous donation RIGHT NOW?
DONATE $250
DONATE $100
RUSH DONATE $42
DONATE OTHER AMOUNT
Chuck Schumer and the Democrats only need to flip FOUR SEATS to win the Senate — and they’re doing everything they can to defeat my friend Roger Marshall.
They’re raising MILLIONS from liberal mega-donors and Swamp special interests to prop up Roger’s opponent, Barbara Bollier. She is nothing but a rubberstamp for their SOCIALIST agenda.
Unlike the unhinged liberals, Roger Marshall is a champion of our America First agenda — and he has my FULL SUPPORT!
I’m personally asking 7,500 conservatives like YOU to step up and help Roger Marshall WIN in Kansas and defend our U.S. Senate majority.
Your president needs you. Roger Marshall needs you. Everything is at stake in this election, and I need YOU to help conservative champions like Roger Marshall defend OUR Senate majority!
Rush a donation of any amount to help my friend Roger Marshall NOW. Please don’t let us down.
Thank you,

When I was a cop in Queens and the Bronx we kept the peace, but now violent crime is skyrocketing.
Instead of finding solutions to keep our neighborhoods safe, AOC's waging a radical campaign to defund the police and attacking the brave men and women who keep us safe.
It's time we defund AOC and stop her from doing any more damage to our community.

TRUMP PENCE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
BREAKING: Joe Biden picks PHONY Kamala Harris as running mate.
Friend,
Wow.
Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn’t get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?).
Next, she ends her pathetic run at President.
Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP.
And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it’s obvious that this radical duo is PERFECT for each other but WRONG for America.
They are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working tirelessly to restore LAW AND ORDER.
It’s going to be up to Patriots like YOU to save our Nation from that dark fate, Friend. Election Day is right around the corner, and now that we know what we’re up against, I’m going to do something HUGE:

542,"We have less than two weeks to succeed in kicking Maxine out of Congress and I need your help. Joe Collins for Congress
Alex,
In 15 terms in Congress – 30 YEARS – radical liberal Maxine Waters has accomplished absolutely nothing.
In the time this radical politician has been in office, here’s what I’ve been doing:
* Grew up in South Central L.A.
* Survived a drive by shooting while living in Maxine’s district
* Graduated high school
* Enlisted in the U.S. Navy
* Participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom
* Retired from the military after 13 proud years
And now, I am running for Congress against Maxine Waters to hold her accountable for not only doing nothing to help our district, but for devestating it with her radical socialist policies.
HELP JOE DEFEAT MAXINE »
Maxine's district – my home – is overrun with crime, drugs, violence, poverty, and homelessness. Yet, her focus is on attacking Donald Trump from the comfort of her $6 million mansion outside the district.
And because she has no accomplishments to stand on, she's counting on attacking my military service record and my support for President Trump in order to keep her seat.
My mission is two-fold:
1. Defeat Maxine so we can began repairing the damage she and her failed policies have done to Los Angeles
2. Make sure these destructive policies don't spread to your community and the rest of our country
We have less than two weeks to succeed in kicking Maxine out of Congress and I need your help. Will you chip in $25, $40, $100 or more to help me and my campaign get the job done?
Thank you!

It's been a month since I challenged my radical liberal opponent Maxine Waters to a public debate... and silence is all we've gotten in return.
Maxine is hiding from me because she knows she has no defense for how her failed socialist policies have only created more poverty and crime in our community.

The only thing Maxine Waters has to offer is hate toward conservatives like you and me, which she cowardly delivers from behind the safety of a TV camera.

TRUMP PENCE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Friend,
It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
For the sake of American strength, jobs, law and order, our lives, and our liberties, we must defeat this radical duo on Election Day. The stakes have never been higher, and we need your help to send a message that this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS.

553,"ROGER STONE
Dear Alex,
I have shocking news. It is truly a life or death situation. Let me explain. My family and I are still in shock.
As you know, back in January I was the victim of a political hit-job by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’ Witch Hunt and was convicted on totally fabricated charges of lying to Congress by a vicious Obama appointed Left-wing Judge, a stacked jury of all Trump-hating Democrats and a corrupt Jury Forewoman.
I was essentially prosecuted because I refused under enormous legal and financial pressure to lie and become a witness against the President who I have known for 40 years and who I spoke to on the phone throughout his historic 2016 Campaign. Mueller’s Dirty Cops had the records of all those phone calls and wanted me to lie about what was discussed in order to impeach the President. I refused.
I was convicted in this political lynching and sentence to almost four years in prison plus two years of supervised probation. I immediately filed a notice of appeal based on the blatant misconduct of the Jury Forewoman. That appeal-if I live long enough to see it through- could take over a year and cost $1 million.
Here is the shocking news- Last week the US Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice told us that Attorney General Barr’s directives to the BOP that inmates convicted of non-violent crimes be transferred from prison to home confinement applies to Democrat super-lawyer Michael Avenatti who was convicted of stealing $25 million from his clients and still faces trial on additional charges, Rick Gates the former Trump campaign official who lied in his testimony against me at my trial and Michael Cohen, the former Trump lawyer who was found guilty of criminal fraud and multiple million dollar tax-evasion and then made a deal to testify against the President\- but NOT to Roger Stone. All these anti-Trump criminals have been released to home confinement.
Rather than home confinement, as ABC news reported today, I have been ordered to surrender to a COVID-19 infested prison in Georgia in just nine days. At 67 years old and with a lifelong history of asthma this is a DEATH SENTENCE!
Here is the proof that I am days away from going to this dangerous prison far from my home and family.
Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Georgia in recent weeks The Prison facility in Jessup has several confirmed cases, awaits tests results of 23 more inmates with symptom and has yet to even test some 1400 other inmates. USA Today reported last week that the BOP handling of COVID-19 has been a disaster and that there is evidence that they are misleading the public about how may cases they really have.
I have no choice but to file an EMERGENCY MOTION with the court that includes my medical records and extensive information from my doctor in a last-minute effort to extend my surrender date at least until the coronavirus crisis in our prisons has passed. We have 24 hours to do that.
This is a LIFE AND DEATH situation. It is clear that the Deep State wants to kill me because I refused to turn on the President and to avenge the 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton.
PLEASE GIVE TO THE STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
President Trump himself has said my trial and conviction was a “miscarriage of Justice” that I was treated “very unfairly” and that my trial was “disgraceful”. I have said openly that I am praying for a commutation of my sentence while my appeal plays out, or even a pardon, but I cannot do that until I have exhausted every legal remedy myself. With this legal motion I will have done so.
I have instructed my new appeals lawyers to prepare a motion challenging this dangerous situation to file in court IMMEDIATELY though I am skeptical about getting a fair ruling from this Judge. My health issues are very real as are the dangers of COVID-19. I don’t understand why I should be treated differently than Avenatti, Cohen, Gates and many others.
My personal physician was contacted just before the weekend and he went to the office Saturday to pulled together all of the records, lab tests and studies that show that a person at my age and in my condition will be highly susceptible to Coronavirus.
But I cannot file this emergency motion in court without your help. We literally don’t have a minute to lose.
As of today, I do not have enough in my STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND to fully pay my lawyers for the complicated legal work that is being done to save me from dying in a coronavirus infested hellhole including the possibility of an emergency appeal to the DC Court of Appeals if Judge Amy Berman Jackson denies me a delay- which based on history is likely.
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
Remember this must all happen in the next NINE days! My wife and family are petrified that I will die of COVID-19 before the election and are outraged by this unfair and unequal treatment!
I am trying to calm them down but I must hear from you.
I know you have been supportive in the past, contributing to help fund my legal defense in what turned out to be an outrageous Soviet-style Show trial in DC last January or signing a petition to the President for Clemency. Can I count on you?
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
This entire horrible ordeal where the legal costs have bankrupted me, the Fake News media has smeared me and the stress of fighting the dirty tactics of Robert Mueller’s now thoroughly discredited Witch-hunt has just worn me down. My wife Nydia now suffers from Rheumatoid Arthritis – Brought on by the stress I am convinced. We are struggling to keep a roof over or head and groceries on the table but I no regrets about my decision to refuse to bare false witness against the President in order to ease the contrived legal danger to myself.
It is only the reaffirmation of my Christian faith in God at the recommendation of Rev. Franklin Graham last January that has given me strength and resolve in this fight for my freedom.
The end is near. Whether I live or die will be decided in the next nine days. I would pay for this myself but I literally have nothing. Please send my Stone Defense Fund whatever you can today.
God Bless You,
Roger Stone
PS -I cannot formally apply for Clemency- either a commutation of sentence or pardon from President Trump, until my legal motions are heard before the trial court and potentially the DC Court of appeals and my legal remedies are exhausted so I need to hear from you today.

Alex –
It's been a month since I challenged my radical liberal opponent Maxine Waters to a public debate... and silence is all we've gotten in return.
Maxine is hiding from me because she knows she has no defense for how her failed socialist policies have only created more poverty and crime in our community.
HELP JOE DEFEAT MAXINE »
The only thing Maxine Waters has to offer is hate toward conservatives like you and me, which she cowardly delivers from behind the safety of a TV camera.
Because Maxine won't show her face, clearly the only way we can hold her accountable is by kicking her out of Congress.
As the official Republican nominee, will you help me defeat radical liberal and cowardly Maxine Waters by chipping in $25, $50 or even $100 or $250 to my campaign today?
Remember, this is the same woman who said impeachmentment wasn't enough for Pres. Trump, but that he should be imprisoned in solitary confinement:
Maxine Tweet
We never hear from Maxine Waters unless she wants to bash on our President. Meanwhile, my community – which has already been destroyed by her failed socialist policies – is suffering from riots and vandalism.
No wonder Maxine is too scared to face me!
It's way past time for Maxine Waters to be retired, so I need your help to show her the door.

BREAKING: Joe Biden picks PHONY Kamala Harris as running mate.
Friend,
Wow.
Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn't get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?).
Next, she ends her pathetic run at President.
Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP.
And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it's obvious that this radical duo is PERFECT for each other but WRONG for America.
They are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working tirelessly to restore LAW AND ORDER.

Mansion Maxine
Maxine Waters has ""represented"" Los Angeles for 44 years, but things are so bad here that even she refuses to live in our district.

When I turned 18, I joined the U.S. Navy. During my service, I was deployed to a combat zone during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
But while I was away serving my country and fighting in a war, Maxine Waters couldn't even be bothered to fight for our own community. So when I returned home from war, it was our district that looked like a war zone.
Los Angeles deserves better! America deserves better!
I need your help to hold Maxine Waters accountable for her failed soclialist policies, fix the mess she's created in our community, and ensure what has happened in Los Angeles doesn't happen to the rest of our country.

563,"While Maxine Waters is hiding from me, she’s sending gangsters and thugs to my events to harass me and my supporters. Joe Collins for Congress
Alex, Maxine Waters is hiding from me.
As the Republican nominee running against radical leftist Maxine, I publicly challenged her to a debate at the beginning of the month.
Typical of a 40+ year career politician who has done NOTHING to help her crumbing district, she has ignored my challenge.
But while Maxine Waters is hiding from me, she’s sending gangsters and thugs to my events to harass me and my supporters.
I need your help to flush radical, cowardly Maxine Waters out of hiding and hold her accountable for her failed socialist policies. Please chip in $250, $100, $50 or even just $25 or $10 to support my campaign and help me defeat Maxine.
Flush Maxine out »
Maxine Waters doesn’t care about our community, and she certainly doesn’t care about black lives.
She’s getting rich off of making a career out of viscously attacking President Trump and conservatives like you and me.
Meanwhile, her failed socialist policies have only resulted in more poverty, joblessness, homelessness, crime and violence in our district.
That’s what Maxine Waters has done to my home, and that’s what she’ll do to the rest of the country if we don’t remove her from office – which is why I need your support today.
Maxine Waters needs to face me and her constituents and answer for her failures. I need your help to flush Maxine out of hiding and force her to debate me – then I need your help to defeat her.
For the good of our country, help me hold radical Maxine Waters accountable by making a contribution of $250, $100, $50 or even $25, $10 or another amount today.
Flush Maxine out »
We can’t let Maxine Waters and her agenda continue to destroy our country. Please do whatever you can to help me defeat her.

Alex,
I have a serious question for you...
Do you want the rest of America to look like the liberal-controlled, crime-ridden, impoverished, freedomless, feces-covered streets of San Francisco and Los Angeles?
...I didn’t think so.
But the liberal politicians who control these derelict cities are already controlling the House of Representatives – Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and Maxine Waters. And now they’re trying to elect San Francisco’s Kamala Harris as VP.
I’m Joe Collins – a black conservative Navy veteran from South Central Los Angeles – and I am the Republican nominee running for Congress against one of these radical leftists: Maxine Waters.
To defeat Maxine and stop California Democrats’ radical takeover of America, I need your support. Please rush $25 or more to my campaign today.

Maxine’s failed policies and ignorance of her constituents have already destroyed Los Angeles. I am running not only to save my home, but also to prevent what the Democrats have done to us from happening to the rest of my country.

What's happened to our district under Maxine's watch is the same thing that will happen to the rest of the country if we let her and her radical allies take control and implement their socialist and lawless agenda.

566,"ROGER STONE
Dear Alex,
I have shocking news. It is truly a life or death situation. Let me explain. My family and I are still in shock.
As you know, back in January I was the victim of a political hit-job by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’ Witch Hunt and was convicted on totally fabricated charges of lying to Congress by a vicious Obama appointed Left-wing Judge, a stacked jury of all Trump-hating Democrats and a corrupt Jury Forewoman.
I was essentially prosecuted because I refused under enormous legal and financial pressure to lie and become a witness against the President who I have known for 40 years and who I spoke to on the phone throughout his historic 2016 Campaign. Mueller’s Dirty Cops had the records of all those phone calls and wanted me to lie about what was discussed in order to impeach the President. I refused.
I was convicted in this political lynching and sentence to almost four years in prison plus two years of supervised probation. I immediately filed a notice of appeal based on the blatant misconduct of the Jury Forewoman. That appeal-if I live long enough to see it through- could take over a year and cost $1 million.
Here is the shocking news- Last week the US Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice told us that Attorney General Barr’s directives to the BOP that inmates convicted of non-violent crimes be transferred from prison to home confinement applies to Democrat super-lawyer Michael Avenatti who was convicted of stealing $25 million from his clients and still faces trial on additional charges, Rick Gates the former Trump campaign official who lied in his testimony against me at my trial and Michael Cohen, the former Trump lawyer who was found guilty of criminal fraud and multiple million dollar tax-evasion and then made a deal to testify against the President\- but NOT to Roger Stone. All these anti-Trump criminals have been released to home confinement.
Rather than home confinement, as ABC news reported today, I have been ordered to surrender to a COVID-19 infested prison in Georgia in just nine days. At 67 years old and with a lifelong history of asthma this is a DEATH SENTENCE!
Here is the proof that I am days away from going to this dangerous prison far from my home and family.
Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Georgia in recent weeks The Prison facility in Jessup has several confirmed cases, awaits tests results of 23 more inmates with symptom and has yet to even test some 1400 other inmates. USA Today reported last week that the BOP handling of COVID-19 has been a disaster and that there is evidence that they are misleading the public about how may cases they really have.
I have no choice but to file an EMERGENCY MOTION with the court that includes my medical records and extensive information from my doctor in a last-minute effort to extend my surrender date at least until the coronavirus crisis in our prisons has passed. We have 24 hours to do that.
This is a LIFE AND DEATH situation. It is clear that the Deep State wants to kill me because I refused to turn on the President and to avenge the 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton.
PLEASE GIVE TO THE STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
President Trump himself has said my trial and conviction was a “miscarriage of Justice” that I was treated “very unfairly” and that my trial was “disgraceful”. I have said openly that I am praying for a commutation of my sentence while my appeal plays out, or even a pardon, but I cannot do that until I have exhausted every legal remedy myself. With this legal motion I will have done so.
I have instructed my new appeals lawyers to prepare a motion challenging this dangerous situation to file in court IMMEDIATELY though I am skeptical about getting a fair ruling from this Judge. My health issues are very real as are the dangers of COVID-19. I don’t understand why I should be treated differently than Avenatti, Cohen, Gates and many others.
My personal physician was contacted just before the weekend and he went to the office Saturday to pulled together all of the records, lab tests and studies that show that a person at my age and in my condition will be highly susceptible to Coronavirus.
But I cannot file this emergency motion in court without your help. We literally don’t have a minute to lose.
As of today, I do not have enough in my STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND to fully pay my lawyers for the complicated legal work that is being done to save me from dying in a coronavirus infested hellhole including the possibility of an emergency appeal to the DC Court of Appeals if Judge Amy Berman Jackson denies me a delay- which based on history is likely.
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
Remember this must all happen in the next NINE days! My wife and family are petrified that I will die of COVID-19 before the election and are outraged by this unfair and unequal treatment!
I am trying to calm them down but I must hear from you.
I know you have been supportive in the past, contributing to help fund my legal defense in what turned out to be an outrageous Soviet-style Show trial in DC last January or signing a petition to the President for Clemency. Can I count on you?
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
This entire horrible ordeal where the legal costs have bankrupted me, the Fake News media has smeared me and the stress of fighting the dirty tactics of Robert Mueller’s now thoroughly discredited Witch-hunt has just worn me down. My wife Nydia now suffers from Rheumatoid Arthritis – Brought on by the stress I am convinced. We are struggling to keep a roof over or head and groceries on the table but I no regrets about my decision to refuse to bare false witness against the President in order to ease the contrived legal danger to myself.
It is only the reaffirmation of my Christian faith in God at the recommendation of Rev. Franklin Graham last January that has given me strength and resolve in this fight for my freedom.
The end is near. Whether I live or die will be decided in the next nine days. I would pay for this myself but I literally have nothing. Please send my Stone Defense Fund whatever you can today.
God Bless You,
Roger Stone
PS -I cannot formally apply for Clemency- either a commutation of sentence or pardon from President Trump, until my legal motions are heard before the trial court and potentially the DC Court of appeals and my legal remedies are exhausted so I need to hear from you today.

BREAKING: Joe Biden picks PHONY Kamala Harris as running mate.
Friend,
Wow.
Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn’t get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?).
Next, she ends her pathetic run at President.
Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP.
And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it’s obvious that this radical duo is PERFECT for each other but WRONG for America.
They are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working tirelessly to restore LAW AND ORDER.
It’s going to be up to Patriots like YOU to save our Nation from that dark fate, Friend. Election Day is right around the corner, and now that we know what we’re up against, I’m going to do something HUGE:

Alex,
Maxine Waters is “overjoyed” that racist Joe Biden picked her buddy Kamala Harris to be his running mate, and we shouldn’t be surprised.
Maxine and Kamala are both radical liberals from California cities – Los Angeles and San Francisco – that their failed socialist and corrupt policies have turned into epicenters for homelessness, poverty, crime, high taxation, and high cost of living.
What they’ve done to LA and SF are exactly what they will do to the rest of America unless we stand up and fight back!
I am the Republican nominee running for Congress to defeat Maxine Waters in November, and I need your continued support to ramp up our campaign in these final months.
Help Joe defeat Maxine →
As a black conservative Navy veteran from South-Central Los Angeles, I have what it takes to finally kick Maxine Waters out of Congress.
I spent 13 years in the United States Navy – including a combat tour during Operation Iraqi Freedom – which taught me the importance of integrity, hard work and service to country ... things Maxine Waters absolutely does not comprehend.
She has completely ignored her crumbling district while spending all her time and energy on viciously attacking President Trump and, lately, aggressively pressuring Biden to pick her buddy Kamala as his running mate.
Radical California liberals like Maxine Waters, Pelosi, Schiff and now Kamala Harris have taken over the Democratic Party, and they're working together to push the same failed policies that have destroyed California, only on a national scale.
Maxine Waters is a ringleader of this new regime, and we need to remove her from Congress now before it’s too late.
We have less than three months until the election, so please chip in $10, $25, $50 or even $100 or more to help us push toward the finish line and defeat radical leftist Maxine Waters.

569,"As I'm sure you heard only minutes after the corrupt and left-wing DC Circuit Court of appeals, against all legal precedent, in violation of current Department of Justice and US Bureau of Prison policy and with complete disregard for my age and history of asthma ordered that I surrender to a prison in Georgia where there are now 60 confirmed COVID-19 Cases tomorrow, a near certain death sentence. FROM THE DESK OF ROGER STONE
Alex,
God is good!
As I'm sure you heard only minutes after the corrupt and left-wing DC Circuit Court of appeals, against all legal precedent, in violation of current Department of Justice and US Bureau of Prison policy and with complete disregard for my age and history of asthma ordered that I surrender to a prison in Georgia where there are now 60 confirmed COVID-19 Cases tomorrow, a near certain death sentence…
President Donald Trump in an act of justice and mercy issued a full commutation of my sentence!
Roger Stone
The truth is, my life would never have been saved without your help!
The President knows that I did not receive a fair trial and that I was facing near-certain fatality in a Corona Virus-infected prison in rural Georgia. In an election year, it was an enormous act of courage and loyalty.
The President knows that I was pressured mercilessly to bear false witness against him and lie about the content of multiple phone calls between us during the 2016 presidential campaign. Even though this would have lessened my legal and financial peril, I refused to be used by the Deep Sxtate in their diabolical plan to impeach the President.
A commutation, however, is not a pardon. While my sentence has been commuted, I will remain a convicted felon unless I appeal my conviction and win a new trial. It is my full intention to pursue this appeal to clear my name.
The unconstitutional and corrupt conduct of the judge, the stunning misconduct of the jury forewoman, and the criminal misconduct of Mueller's dirty cops who prosecuted me – all of which were concealed in my original trial by the judge, will be fully exposed know that I know I will live long enough to get a hearing of my appeal.
Even worse, many powerful Democrats and CNN are demanding that New York State bring a new prosecution against me based on the false claim that I sought to conceal misconduct by the President (when in fact I refused to bear false witness against him) and traded this for the commutation of my sentence – it is a lie! My lawyers now anticipate an entirely new fight in New York State where the state Attorney General is an anti-Trump psychopath and the Manhattan District Attorney is already scrutinizing every business transaction President Trump did as a private citizen looking for something – anything – to prosecute him for.
It is not coincidental that only hours before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals voted 3 - 0 send me to my death, and the president stepped in in the knick of time to save me from this gross injustice. Facebook announced that I would be banned from their platform for life as well as being banned on the Instagram platform which they own.
They base this outrageous act of censorship on the false claim arising from the Mueller report that I owned and operated 100 ""Fake"" Facebook pages. This claim – which was the conclusion of a left-wing New York research firm is 100 percent false. I have never owned or operated any Facebook page in the name of another person or in the name of a political organization that did not legitimately exist.
This was clearly an effort to silence me at the same time as they were essentially planning to lynch me.
Now I have no choice but to wage a three-front battle. I must finance an appeal to overturn my verdict to clear my name. When the President called to tell me that he had commuted my sentence, he strongly urged me to pursue this appeal. I must finance a defense if New York State seeks essentially to retry me on Mueller's false charges and I must also sue Facebook as well as the New York based research firm that created this phony report in order to get my voice back.
Needless to say, these 3 battles could cost another $2 million. Thanks to your generosity, I have raised and spent almost $2 million in my initial legal defense, but now realize that it didn't matter how much I spent for lawyers or how skilled those lawyers were, my trial in DC was rigged from the beginning.
Won't you help me finish and win this vital fight? Won't you please consider a contribution to the STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND today?
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND »
I always thought that this completely phony investigation and the trumped-up charges against me were always designed to ensure that I was off the battlefield in 2020. Although I have signed up at Parler – a great new social media platform that does not censor Republicans, Conservatives, or Trump supporters, it is clear that the Deep State and their Silicon Valley collaborators want to limit my voice in the upcoming presidential showdown.
If you have seen the latest polls you know that the deadly COVID-19 virus has destroyed the strongest and most vibrant economic comeback in our Nation's history – destroying President Trump's signature accomplishments, record job growth, record wage growth, and a record level of employment have been brought low when the President had no choice but to protect the public health. This economic crash explains why the President is running slightly behind his democratic opponent Joe Biden in virtually every swing state.
I urgently need to put this appeal behind me and maximize my voice on social media in order to do what I did in 2016, which is to work hard to win this election for the President. I need your help to do that.
God bless you for all you have done for me and my family in this horrific ordeal.
Even today Robert Mueller, Rod Rosenstein, Andrew Weissmann, Adam Schiff, and Jerry Nadler are recycling all of their most vicious falsehoods and claiming yet again that I was colluding with Russian Intelligence to benefit the Trump Campaign in 2016. They just keep recycling the same lies even though they know that Mueller's investigation never produced any evidence whatsoever that this was true and even after Mueller's invasive investigation, I was never charged with any such crime.
This ordeal has left me broke, having lost my home, my savings, most of our insurance, and my car. We continue to struggle to pay for rent, groceries, utilities, gasoline (my wife's car is 10 years old), medical expenses, and prescription drugs. I am excited to know that I can get back to making a living and rebuild our life but, in the meantime, if you want to help my family you can give to the STONE FAMILY SUPPORT FUND.
I will keep fighting but I need your help today.
God Bless You,

I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.

I grew up in South-Central Los Angeles in the district Maxine is supposed to – but refuses to – represent in Congress.
Maxine’s policies are responsible for the poverty, crime and violence that plague our community... they’re responsible for the drive-by shooting that left bullet holes in my family’s windows and sofa when I was young.
After serving my country in the U.S. Navy, which included a combat tour as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, I have decided to serve my community and my country again and rescue us from Maxine Waters.
But to achieve this, I need help from other conservative patriots, like you.
Our campaign has already raised over $3 million to defeat Maxine. Victory is within grasp, but it’s going to take continued effort and support from every corner of the nation to kick her out of office after more than four decades.
Will you support our grassroots campaign with a contribution of $25 or more and help this black conservative Navy veteran defeat radical socialist Maxine Waters?
DEFEAT MAXINE »
Maxine is not only a failure; she is openly hateful toward conservatives like you and me and has dedicated her entire attention to trying to impeach our President rather than serving her constituents.
It’s time for Maxine Waters to go!
Don’t let hateful socialist Maxine Waters go unopposed any longer. Chip in $25 or more now and help me give Maxine the boot!
Thanks,

Fellow Patriot, my friend Dr. Roger Marshall is OUR Republican U.S. Senate nominee in Kansas — and he needs your help to WIN!
Roger has served our country in the military. He’s strong on crime and securing the border, he’s fighting for our farmers, and he stood with me from DAY ONE against the Democrats’ impeachment SHAM.
Because Roger is with US — not the SWAMP — he has a target on his back. Chuck Schumer and the radical Democrats have raised $10 MILLION to defeat him.
Fellow Patriot, control of the U.S. Senate is at stake — and it’s critical that YOU step up to help my friend Roger Marshall defend OUR Republican majority. Can you rush a generous donation RIGHT NOW?
DONATE $250
DONATE $100
RUSH DONATE $42
DONATE OTHER AMOUNT
Chuck Schumer and the Democrats only need to flip FOUR SEATS to win the Senate — and they’re doing everything they can to defeat my friend Roger Marshall.
They’re raising MILLIONS from liberal mega-donors and Swamp special interests to prop up Roger’s opponent, Barbara Bollier. She is nothing but a rubberstamp for their SOCIALIST agenda.
Unlike the unhinged liberals, Roger Marshall is a champion of our America First agenda — and he has my FULL SUPPORT!
I’m personally asking 7,500 conservatives like YOU to step up and help Roger Marshall WIN in Kansas and defend our U.S. Senate majority.
Your president needs you. Roger Marshall needs you. Everything is at stake in this election, and I need YOU to help conservative champions like Roger Marshall defend OUR Senate majority!
Rush a donation of any amount to help my friend Roger Marshall NOW. Please don’t let us down.
Thank you,

Maxine Waters doesn’t care about our community, and she certainly doesn’t care about black lives.
She’s getting rich off of making a career out of viscously attacking President Trump and conservatives like you and me.
Meanwhile, her failed socialist policies have only resulted in more poverty, joblessness, homelessness, crime and violence in our district.
That’s what Maxine Waters has done to my home, and that’s what she’ll do to the rest of the country if we don’t remove her from office – which is why I need your support today.
Maxine Waters needs to face me and her constituents and answer for her failures. I need your help to flush Maxine out of hiding and force her to debate me – then I need your help to defeat her.

Fellow patriot,
I'm Joe Collins, the Republican and Navy veteran running for Congress against Maxine Waters. You've probably seen my new ad ""Mansion Maxine"" on social media:
Mansion Maxine
Maxine Waters has ""represented"" Los Angeles for 44 years, but things are so bad here that even she refuses to live in our district.
While Maxine sits in her out-of-district mansion, the rest of us have to live with the crime, violence, drugs, poverty and homelessness that her decades of failed radical policies have created.
I'm running for Congress to undo the mess that Maxine Waters has created, and I need your help to defeat her in just a few weeks.
Will you help me kick Maxine Waters out of Congress and fight for safe streets and a strong economy by chipping in $25, $50, $100 or more now?
HELP JOE DEFEAT MAXINE »
When I turned 18, I joined the U.S. Navy. During my service, I was deployed to a combat zone during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
But while I was away serving my country and fighting in a war, Maxine Waters couldn't even be bothered to fight for our own community. So when I returned home from war, it was our district that looked like a war zone.
Los Angeles deserves better! America deserves better!
I need your help to hold Maxine Waters accountable for her failed soclialist policies, fix the mess she's created in our community, and ensure what has happened in Los Angeles doesn't happen to the rest of our country.
With just weeks left until Election Day, will you chip in $25, $50, $100 or even more to help me defeat Maxine Waters and restore responsible leadership in Congress?

What's happened to our district under Maxine's watch is the same thing that will happen to the rest of the country if we let her and her radical allies take control and implement their socialist and lawless agenda.
Maxine Waters MUST be held accountable and forced to explain herself to her consituents, so I am calling her out for a debate and I need you to get my back.

Alex,
Maxine Waters is “overjoyed” that racist Joe Biden picked her buddy Kamala Harris to be his running mate, and we shouldn’t be surprised.
Maxine and Kamala are both radical liberals from California cities – Los Angeles and San Francisco – that their failed socialist and corrupt policies have turned into epicenters for homelessness, poverty, crime, high taxation, and high cost of living.
What they’ve done to LA and SF are exactly what they will do to the rest of America unless we stand up and fight back!

As a black conservative Navy veteran from South-Central Los Angeles, I have what it takes to finally kick Maxine Waters out of Congress.
I spent 13 years in the United States Navy – including a combat tour during Operation Iraqi Freedom – which taught me the importance of integrity, hard work and service to country ... things Maxine Waters absolutely does not comprehend.
She has completely ignored her crumbling district while spending all her time and energy on viciously attacking President Trump and, lately, aggressively pressuring Biden to pick her buddy Kamala as his running mate.
Radical California liberals like Maxine Waters, Pelosi, Schiff and now Kamala Harris have taken over the Democratic Party, and they're working together to push the same failed policies that have destroyed California, only on a national scale.
Maxine Waters is a ringleader of this new regime, and we need to remove her from Congress now before it’s too late.

Alex,
I'm Joe Collins, the Republican and Navy veteran running for Congress against Maxine Waters. You've probably seen my new ad ""Mansion Maxine"" on social media:
Mansion Maxine
Maxine Waters has ""represented"" Los Angeles for 44 years, but things are so bad here that even she refuses to live in our district.
While Maxine sits in her out-of-district mansion, the rest of us have to live with the crime, violence, drugs, poverty and homelessness that her decades of failed radical policies have created.
I'm running for Congress to undo the mess that Maxine Waters has created, and I need your help to defeat her in just a few weeks.
Will you help me kick Maxine Waters out of Congress and fight for safe streets and a strong economy by chipping in $25, $50, $100 or more now?
HELP JOE DEFEAT MAXINE »
When I turned 18, I joined the U.S. Navy. During my service, I was deployed to a combat zone during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
But while I was away serving my country and fighting in a war, Maxine Waters couldn't even be bothered to fight for our own community. So when I returned home from war, it was our district that looked like a war zone.
Los Angeles deserves better! America deserves better!
I need your help to hold Maxine Waters accountable for her failed soclialist policies, fix the mess she's created in our community, and ensure what has happened in Los Angeles doesn't happen to the rest of our country.
With just weeks left until Election Day, will you chip in $25, $50, $100 or even more to help me defeat Maxine Waters and restore responsible leadership in Congress?

What's happened to our district under Maxine's watch is the same thing that will happen to the rest of the country if we let her and her radical allies take control and implement their socialist and lawless agenda.

592,"ROGER STONE
Dear Alex,
I have shocking news. It is truly a life or death situation. Let me explain. My family and I are still in shock.
As you know, back in January I was the victim of a political hit-job by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’ Witch Hunt and was convicted on totally fabricated charges of lying to Congress by a vicious Obama appointed Left-wing Judge, a stacked jury of all Trump-hating Democrats and a corrupt Jury Forewoman.
I was essentially prosecuted because I refused under enormous legal and financial pressure to lie and become a witness against the President who I have known for 40 years and who I spoke to on the phone throughout his historic 2016 Campaign. Mueller’s Dirty Cops had the records of all those phone calls and wanted me to lie about what was discussed in order to impeach the President. I refused.
I was convicted in this political lynching and sentence to almost four years in prison plus two years of supervised probation. I immediately filed a notice of appeal based on the blatant misconduct of the Jury Forewoman. That appeal-if I live long enough to see it through- could take over a year and cost $1 million.
Here is the shocking news- Last week the US Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice told us that Attorney General Barr’s directives to the BOP that inmates convicted of non-violent crimes be transferred from prison to home confinement applies to Democrat super-lawyer Michael Avenatti who was convicted of stealing $25 million from his clients and still faces trial on additional charges, Rick Gates the former Trump campaign official who lied in his testimony against me at my trial and Michael Cohen, the former Trump lawyer who was found guilty of criminal fraud and multiple million dollar tax-evasion and then made a deal to testify against the President\- but NOT to Roger Stone. All these anti-Trump criminals have been released to home confinement.
Rather than home confinement, as ABC news reported today, I have been ordered to surrender to a COVID-19 infested prison in Georgia in just nine days. At 67 years old and with a lifelong history of asthma this is a DEATH SENTENCE!
Here is the proof that I am days away from going to this dangerous prison far from my home and family.
Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Georgia in recent weeks The Prison facility in Jessup has several confirmed cases, awaits tests results of 23 more inmates with symptom and has yet to even test some 1400 other inmates. USA Today reported last week that the BOP handling of COVID-19 has been a disaster and that there is evidence that they are misleading the public about how may cases they really have.
I have no choice but to file an EMERGENCY MOTION with the court that includes my medical records and extensive information from my doctor in a last-minute effort to extend my surrender date at least until the coronavirus crisis in our prisons has passed. We have 24 hours to do that.
This is a LIFE AND DEATH situation. It is clear that the Deep State wants to kill me because I refused to turn on the President and to avenge the 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton.
PLEASE GIVE TO THE STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
President Trump himself has said my trial and conviction was a “miscarriage of Justice” that I was treated “very unfairly” and that my trial was “disgraceful”. I have said openly that I am praying for a commutation of my sentence while my appeal plays out, or even a pardon, but I cannot do that until I have exhausted every legal remedy myself. With this legal motion I will have done so.
I have instructed my new appeals lawyers to prepare a motion challenging this dangerous situation to file in court IMMEDIATELY though I am skeptical about getting a fair ruling from this Judge. My health issues are very real as are the dangers of COVID-19. I don’t understand why I should be treated differently than Avenatti, Cohen, Gates and many others.
My personal physician was contacted just before the weekend and he went to the office Saturday to pulled together all of the records, lab tests and studies that show that a person at my age and in my condition will be highly susceptible to Coronavirus.
But I cannot file this emergency motion in court without your help. We literally don’t have a minute to lose.
As of today, I do not have enough in my STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND to fully pay my lawyers for the complicated legal work that is being done to save me from dying in a coronavirus infested hellhole including the possibility of an emergency appeal to the DC Court of Appeals if Judge Amy Berman Jackson denies me a delay- which based on history is likely.
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
Remember this must all happen in the next NINE days! My wife and family are petrified that I will die of COVID-19 before the election and are outraged by this unfair and unequal treatment!
I am trying to calm them down but I must hear from you.
I know you have been supportive in the past, contributing to help fund my legal defense in what turned out to be an outrageous Soviet-style Show trial in DC last January or signing a petition to the President for Clemency. Can I count on you?
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
This entire horrible ordeal where the legal costs have bankrupted me, the Fake News media has smeared me and the stress of fighting the dirty tactics of Robert Mueller’s now thoroughly discredited Witch-hunt has just worn me down. My wife Nydia now suffers from Rheumatoid Arthritis – Brought on by the stress I am convinced. We are struggling to keep a roof over or head and groceries on the table but I no regrets about my decision to refuse to bare false witness against the President in order to ease the contrived legal danger to myself.
It is only the reaffirmation of my Christian faith in God at the recommendation of Rev. Franklin Graham last January that has given me strength and resolve in this fight for my freedom.
The end is near. Whether I live or die will be decided in the next nine days. I would pay for this myself but I literally have nothing. Please send my Stone Defense Fund whatever you can today.
God Bless You,
Roger Stone
PS -I cannot formally apply for Clemency- either a commutation of sentence or pardon from President Trump, until my legal motions are heard before the trial court and potentially the DC Court of appeals and my legal remedies are exhausted so I need to hear from you today.

Friend,
It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
For the sake of American strength, jobs, law and order, our lives, and our liberties, we must defeat this radical duo on Election Day. The stakes have never been higher, and we need your help to send a message that this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS.

Alex,
I’m the Republican nominee taking on Maxine Waters, but as a black man I’m not your typical Republican.
I am determined to defeat Maxine because I have witnessed firsthand how her radical socialist policies have failed and even destroyed my community. I refuse to let her destroy the rest of our country.
HELP JOE DEFEAT MAXINE »
I grew up in South-Central Los Angeles in the district Maxine is supposed to – but refuses to – represent in Congress.
Maxine’s policies are responsible for the poverty, crime and violence that plague our community... they’re responsible for the drive-by shooting that left bullet holes in my family’s windows and sofa when I was young.
After serving my country in the U.S. Navy, which included a combat tour as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, I have decided to serve my community and my country again and rescue us from Maxine Waters.
But to achieve this, I need help from other conservative patriots, like you.
Our campaign has already raised over $3 million to defeat Maxine. Victory is within grasp, but it’s going to take continued effort and support from every corner of the nation to kick her out of office after more than four decades.
Will you support our grassroots campaign with a contribution of $25 or more and help this black conservative Navy veteran defeat radical socialist Maxine Waters?
DEFEAT MAXINE »
Maxine is not only a failure; she is openly hateful toward conservatives like you and me and has dedicated her entire attention to trying to impeach our President rather than serving her constituents.

It’s going to be President Trump and Vice President Pence on the ballot against two of our Nation’s most RADICAL Democrats: Sleepy Joe Biden and Phony Kamala Harris.
Both of them are corrupt career politicians who LOVE anarchy and HATE America. They are WEAK on crime and they would DESTROY everything we’ve worked so hard for.
We know that Joe and Kamala don’t stand a chance against President Trump and Vice President Pence, but we can’t ignore the fact they are being FLOODED with dirty Mega Donor Money coming from ELITES who live on the COAST.
It’s REAL Americans vs. SOCIALISTS, and President Trump is calling on YOU to step up and make a statement that AMERICA IS NOT FOR SALE.
For the NEXT HOUR: all gifts 600%-MATCHED!
Please contribute $42 in the NEXT HOUR to FIGHT for President Trump and Vice President Pence and your gift will be 600%-MATCHED. >>
Fight for Your Country! Contribute Now.
CONTRIBUTE $250 = $1750 CONTRIBUTE $100 = $700 CONTRIBUTE $50 = $350
CONTRIBUTE $42 = $294 CONTRIBUTE ANY AMOUNT
The future of our Country is at stake and we need EVERY Patriot to step up if we’re going to protect it from Joe and Kamala’s RADICAL Left-ist agenda.
* Kamala embraced Bernie Sanders plan for SOCIALIZED medicine
* She called for TRILLIONS in new taxes
* She attacked Joe Biden for RACIST policies
* And then voters REJECTED her because she’s a PHONY.
President Trump wants to know who stood with him during this critical time. He’ll be looking for your name on the donor list in ONE HOUR.

TRUMP PENCE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
BREAKING: Joe Biden picks PHONY Kamala Harris as running mate.
Friend,
Wow.
Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn’t get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?).
Next, she ends her pathetic run at President.
Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP.
And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it’s obvious that this radical duo is PERFECT for each other but WRONG for America.
They are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working tirelessly to restore LAW AND ORDER.
It’s going to be up to Patriots like YOU to save our Nation from that dark fate, Friend. Election Day is right around the corner, and now that we know what we’re up against, I’m going to do something HUGE:
For the NEXT HOUR, all contributions will be 600%-MATCHED!
I want a list of all Patriots who donate in the NEXT HOUR. I know I’ll see your name at the very top.

Alex,
I'm Joe Collins, the Republican and Navy veteran running for Congress against Maxine Waters. You've probably seen my new ad ""Mansion Maxine"" on social media:
Mansion Maxine
Maxine Waters has ""represented"" Los Angeles for 44 years, but things are so bad here that even she refuses to live in our district.
While Maxine sits in her out-of-district mansion, the rest of us have to live with the crime, violence, drugs, poverty and homelessness that her decades of failed radical policies have created.
I'm running for Congress to undo the mess that Maxine Waters has created, and I need your help to defeat her in just a few weeks.
Will you help me kick Maxine Waters out of Congress and fight for safe streets and a strong economy by chipping in $25, $50, $100 or more now?
HELP JOE DEFEAT MAXINE »
When I turned 18, I joined the U.S. Navy. During my service, I was deployed to a combat zone during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
But while I was away serving my country and fighting in a war, Maxine Waters couldn't even be bothered to fight for our own community. So when I returned home from war, it was our district that looked like a war zone.
Los Angeles deserves better! America deserves better!
I need your help to hold Maxine Waters accountable for her failed soclialist policies, fix the mess she's created in our community, and ensure what has happened in Los Angeles doesn't happen to the rest of our country.
With just weeks left until Election Day, will you chip in $25, $50, $100 or even more to help me defeat Maxine Waters and restore responsible leadership in Congress?

How we as people act matters.

There is a battle being fought for the soul of our nation. This is a historic moment of division and divisiveness. How our country acts now will have lasting effects on the future. How we as people act matters.
When the Democrats accused me of being a “token” for introducing legislation which would support the good cops and weed out the bad cops and take common sense steps to rebuild lost trust between communities of color and law enforcement, they implied that I was a traitor to African Americans.
Alex, I need your help to show the Democrats that caring about this country and ALL of the people who live here takes more than wearing a stereotypical scarf for a photoshoot.
Can you chip in $15 to send a message that we don't have time to play politics?
As a nation we need to unite. It is through hard times like these that we come out stronger. Can you help me ensure that we have a Republican majority to help us get there?

Roger has served our country in the military. He’s strong on crime and securing the border, he’s fighting for our farmers, and he stood with me from DAY ONE against the Democrats’ impeachment SHAM.
Because Roger is with US — not the SWAMP — he has a target on his back. Chuck Schumer and the radical Democrats have raised $10 MILLION to defeat him.

Alex, Maxine Waters is hiding from me.
As the Republican nominee running against radical leftist Maxine, I publicly challenged her to a debate at the beginning of the month.
Typical of a 40+ year career politician who has done NOTHING to help her crumbing district, she has ignored my challenge.
But while Maxine Waters is hiding from me, she’s sending gangsters and thugs to my events to harass me and my supporters.

Flush Maxine out »
Maxine Waters doesn’t care about our community, and she certainly doesn’t care about black lives.
She’s getting rich off of making a career out of viscously attacking President Trump and conservatives like you and me.
Meanwhile, her failed socialist policies have only resulted in more poverty, joblessness, homelessness, crime and violence in our district.
That’s what Maxine Waters has done to my home, and that’s what she’ll do to the rest of the country if we don’t remove her from office – which is why I need your support today.
Maxine Waters needs to face me and her constituents and answer for her failures. I need your help to flush Maxine out of hiding and force her to debate me – then I need your help to defeat her.
For the good of our country, help me hold radical Maxine Waters accountable by making a contribution of $250, $100, $50 or even $25, $10 or another amount today.

This week we saw a historic decision from the Supreme Court that determined people cannot be fired for their gender identity or sexual orientation — a landmark in the continued journey for equality and something we all here at #TeamGood are celebrating! But make no mistake, the fight continues every day.
Our Suncoast community is home to thousands of LGBTQ+ constituents, and while this week brought a huge and historic victory in the Supreme Court, just days before on the anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub shooting, the Trump administration rolled back health care protections for the transgender community.
But it’s not just the Trump administration that turns its back on LGBTQ+ Americans.
Vern Buchanan has stood with Trump and voted time and again against protecting LGBTQ+ Americans. He voted against the bipartisan Equality Act, which would prohibit discrimination against LGBTQ+ people and would have prevented the Trump Administration from rolling back healthcare protections for transgender Americans.
If you’ve had enough of Vern Buchanan, stand with Margaret Good. If you believe that LGBTQ+ Floridians deserve a representative who won't fall silent in the face of the bigotry and who will stand up for their rights, now is the time to take action.
Buchanan voted time and again against the bipartisan Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expands federal hate crime protections to LGBTQ+ individuals and makes it easier for the federal government to prosecute hate crimes based on race, religion, or national origin.
Vern Buchanan has turned his back on the LGBTQ+ community. He refuses to protect our friends, family, and neighbors from discrimination and hate.
If you know it is time for change, add your name to the thousands of reasonable people who are calling for Vern’s retirement.
This is our time.

The future of our country and our state is on the line. Chaos, anarchy and violent crime has gripped cities across New York and our leaders have turned their backs on the brave heroes in law enforcement who keep us safe.
While Cuomo, de Blasio and New York Democrats seek to limit the rights and freedoms of law-abiding New Yorkers, dangerous criminals are allowed free rein.
That is why I am writing to you today to ask you to renew your New York Republican Party membership for the 2020 election cycle.
This is no time to sit back--our mission is more critical than ever. Democrats in New York have already delivered a disastrous end to bail laws that are putting violent criminals right back onto the streets. They have already gutted the NYPD's budget and they won't be happy until they have completely dismantled everything that makes our country so special.
We’re counting on loyal members like you to help us ensure our strong Republican candidates have the resources they need to fight back against this extremism.
According to our records, you have not yet renewed your New York Republican Party membership for the 2020 election cycle.
Make sure you stand up and are counted. If you don’t renew soon, you will miss access to critical information about the 2020 election cycle, including President Trump’s reelection and our important congressional and state legislative races.
You must act now.
Get your exclusive 2020 NYGOP Membership Card TODAY!
President Trump is counting on us to deliver him a big re-election victory, and he told me personally how important it is to him to win right here in New York.
We worked tirelessly to recruit strong Republicans to run for office and I’m so excited about the slate of new fighters who are running this year to restore common sense and balance to government.
Everything is on the line.
Restoring two-party government is essential to New York’s future. Our wins this year will preserve the New York Republican Party for the next decade after redistricting.
Democrats’ extreme policies have already driven more than a million New Yorkers to other states and we are facing an even greater mass exodus thanks to coronavirus and the unraveling of our public safety.
We cannot afford to let this radical agenda gain a permanent foothold in New York.
We can stop all of this NOW, and we WILL.
It’s time for common sense to make a comeback in New York and it starts now with the NYGOP.
As a sustaining 2020 member, you will play a vital role in our New York GOP operations. If we’re going to win again, we’re going to need every member to renew their commitment to the NYGOP.
Can we count on you to renew your 2020 New York Republican membership today with a generous donation of $25 today? When we receive your contribution, we will ship you an exclusive 2020 membership card.
FOR $25 SECURE YOUR OFFICIAL 2020 REPUBLICAN MEMBERSHIP TODAY
Your membership goes directly toward helping our Republican candidates WIN. Please contribute $25 or more to ensure President Trump has four more years and our New York Republican Party can deliver big victories this November.
Thank you.

Nick Langworthy,

﻿Chairman’s Report
Dear Alex,
As a New Yorker, you have witnessed the impact of the deadly policies put in place by the progressive left. Our public safety is threatened like never before. Violent crime is no longer an occasion, and instead, has become a way of life.
Every day we are reading headlines of multiple shootings, stabbings and robberies in every part of the state. New York is on the precipice of a disaster from which it might not recover unless we make an immediate change in direction and leadership -- the very opportunity we have this November.
I have seen an outpouring of support everyday from New Yorkers who are fed up with the insanity of the Democrat Party and are joining our cause. We need to seize this momentum for our state government -- and our best chance to make a change this year is in the New York State Senate. We have to channel the energy and support of New Yorkers to not only win some seats in the State Senate, but to take back control and restore balance in our state government.
A statewide police union coalition just doubled down on its campaign against the New York State Senate’s anti-police, pro-criminal Democratic conference, issuing 15 new endorsements of Republican incumbents and challengers in contested races across the state.
These unprecedented joint endorsements follow last week’s announcement of six endorsements in Long Island and Hudson Valley battleground districts. They see what failed programs and laws of the current NYS Legislature are doing to our neighborhoods and they stand against the Democrats’ destructive agenda of putting felons before families.
As Election Day quickly approaches, it’s imperative that we continue to do all that we can to remove the radical New York Democrats that are controlling the entire New York State agenda and return sanity and balance in our state government.
Together, we can impact change. Together we can win.
Sincerely,
Nick Langworthy

“It was Republicans who took New York City from a criminal’s paradise to a global attraction for business, tourism and residency, and we’re prepared to do it again,” said NYGOP Chairman Nick Langworthy. “The policies of the radical left have destroyed all of that hard-fought progress and created version 2.0 of their disaster. We cannot give up on New York City--its success is essential to our state and our country--so we are launching a call to action to save it. We want people to know that we care about every New Yorker and we are offering an agenda that puts their safety and security as our number one priority.”

Chairman’s Report
Dear Alex,
In August 2020, NYC witnessed a 166% increase in shooting incidents -- 242 compared to 91 from August 2019, while murders are up 47% -- 53 versus 36. This is thanks to Governor Cuomo, Mayor deBlasio and the Democrats in the NYS Legislature whose coddling of criminals, anti-police policies and the dangerous elimination of police funding has created a dangerous environment throughout our state, and especially in New York City.
The official NYPD crime statistics were recently released for the month of August, and New York City notched another huge increase as the NYPD is coping with the lowest number of cops on the streets in six years.
Why is the NYPD seeing a dramatic drop in officers? It is due to the combination of Mayor deBlasio’s $1 billion defund-the-police budget cuts, no overtime, no new police class, and a dramatic increase in the number of police officers retiring. They have calculated that there are approximately 2,000-4,000 less officers out on the streets on any given week.
The violence is terrifying residents and families in the community are afraid. People are moving out of the city in droves, and the Democrats and those aiding them in the media are working hard to ignore this problem.
While Cuomo, deBlasio and the NYS Democrats have clearly walked away from law enforcement, I am proud to say the New York State Republican Party backs the blue. We want every person in every corner of the state to hear us loud and clear: our feet are planted firmly on the thin blue line with the brave heroes who risk their lives to keep us safe every day.
Our law enforcement does a job that deserves our respect and our thanks. We need to DEFEND the police, not DEFUND the police, and we will continue to do everything that we can to stop this radical agenda that is destroying the fabric of our society and the safety of our communities.
If you are with us, join me in solidarity by donating today.
Sincerely,
Nick Langworthy
New York State Republican Chairman

﻿Chairman’s Report
Dear Alex,
While New York State is facing a $14.5 billion deficit, it’s important to point out that over $6 billion of that existed before anyone knew the word coronavirus. Because of the terrible management of our state, New York is now in an even deeper hole.
Governor Cuomo has run this state into the ground, but the Democrat-controlled State Legislature is also to blame. They handed the Governor unchecked dictatorial powers and then abandoned their constitutional duties as a co-equal branch of government. They dodged their responsibilities and then they went missing in action. The Senate and Assembly Democrats also turned their backs on our police officers and are the ones responsible for the failed bail reform law that allows criminals to walk away to commit more crimes.
We are less than five weeks away from a critical election for New York State. The Democrats who control the NYS Legislature have failed us and New Yorkers must send them a message. We need to support candidates that are willing to fight for the safety of our law enforcement and the communities we live in -- as well as for our economic recovery.
On this week’s video town hall, I was pleased to chat with three strong candidates who are all running for office in the New York State Assembly -- Dave Catalfamo, Jodi Giglio and Patricia Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick. They are leading the way by campaigning on how smart, Republican policies will rebuild our economy, restore public safety and security and create a bright future for New York.
We're proud to have them representing the NYGOP in their races this year and we are thrilled they joined us to share their insights, updates on their campaigns, and to take your questions. If you were unable to attend, I encourage you to watch the town hall below.
Lastly, I ask that you join me in prayer for the swift recovery of our President, First Lady, and everyone who has tested positive for COVID-19 this week.
Sincerely,
Nick Langworthy
New York State Republican Chairman

614,"Friend,
Our Chairman Nick Langworthy is in Charlotte and just cast New York's 94 delegate votes UNANIMOUSLY for President Donald J. Trump!
Chairman Langworthy Casts All of New York's Votes for President Trump!
But he didn't stop there--he also used his time at the microphone to SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT on President Trump's incredible leadership for New York throughout coronavirus. Despite the lies told during Democrats' fictional convention last week, Chairman Langworthy reminded America that President Trump gave New York everything it asked for. Even dishonest Governor Cuomo thanked President Trump for his tremendous support.
From sending the U.S.S. Comfort, to providing PPE and thousands of ventilators to lifting up New Yorkers and small businesses with financial aid, President Trump delivered for the state of New York.
But it's New York's leadership that has created turmoil. Our worst-in-the-nation business climate, multi-billion dollar budget deficit and crime-riddled [[URL REDACTED]] failed New York agenda will be the failed national agenda under the Biden-Harris ticket.
That is why the New York GOP is fighting to give President Trump FOUR MORE YEARS! Will you stand up with us and FIGHT?
FIGHT WITH US TO RE-ELECT PRESIDENT TRUMP
We are 70 days away from Election Day and President Trump Needs us to have a strong NYGOP in fighting shape. Help us beat back the Democrats' lies and fake news!

As one of our loyal supporters, I wanted you to be one of the first to know about our new ad campaign we are launching today called:
""Save New York: A Call to Action.""
Join Us
HELP US GET THIS MESSAGE IN FRONT OF EVERY NEW YORKER!
Every day, news reports detail horrific stories of how violent crime and chaos is gripping our cities. In New York City, new statistics revealed shootings have already doubled in 2020 from last year. It's a similar story in cities across Upstate.
The radical left has surrendered our streets to dangerous criminals who have no respect for human life or property. THAT MUST END.
It was Republicans who took New York City from a criminal’s paradise to a global attraction for business, tourism and residency, and we’re prepared to do it again.
We cannot give up on New York City--its success is essential to our state and our country--so we are launching a call to action to save it.
We want all New Yorkers--regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or political affiliation--to join our cause to save New York.
Elections matter. And if we are united in our cause, we can restore safety and sanity to New York. Join us before it's too late.

NYGOP Chairman Nick Langworthy Calls for Cuomo, State Leaders to Condemn Democrat Socialists of America Violence and Riot Against President Trump Supporters in Ithaca
\--
Perpetrators Must be Prosecuted
Calls for Radical Cornell Professor Celebrating the Violence to Be Terminated
New York--October 17, [[URL REDACTED]] New York Republican Party today called on Governor Andrew Cuomo and the state’s Democrat leaders to condemn the violent protest and riot led by the Democrat Socialists of America’s Ithaca chapter yesterday and for the perpetrators who committed crimes to be prosecuted.
Democrat socialists descended on Republicans who organized a peaceful rally in support of President Trump in front of the Tompkins Republican Party campaign headquarters. Members of the DSA initiated violence, threats, destruction of property and forced the shutdown of the highway while cornering the President’s supporters.
A female Trump supporter had to be taken to the hospital after her shoulder was dislocated, rioters were ripping signs and hats from supporters and burning them while threatening their safety. The campaign headquarters was spray painted with “Trump Dies” and “Jesus Hates Cops.” Police were forced to close Route 13 as protestors yelled at them “Cops and Klan go hand in hand.” DSA members cornered the President’s supporters forcing them inside their building.
Despite news reports detailing what happened, no Democrats, including local candidates Tracy Mitrano who is running for Congress and Leslie Danks Burke who is running for state senate have come out to condemn the violence.
“The violence and rioting of Democrat Socialists against peaceful New Yorkers exercising their First Amendment rights is disgusting and must be unequivocally condemned by our state’s leaders,” said New York Republican Chairman Nick Langworthy. “The perpetrators of this violence must be prosecuted and there must be a clear message that this behavior will not be tolerated. It is the radical left who is filled with hate and violence and they must be stopped.”
“From their social media postings and what happened it looks like these Democrat Socialists came looking for trouble and to deprive the Republican rallies of their civil rights, using violence and intimidation to do so,” said Tompkins County Republican Chairman Mike Sigler. “They were an angry mob who terrorized people. Some were physically hurt and they destroyed our property. The vitriol and hate against people who don’t share their authoritarian views is nothing short of reprehensible. This is what we are fighting against in this election.”
Chairman Langworthy also blasted radical Cornell History Professor Russell Rickford, a member of the DSA for celebrating the violent event and calling it a “joyful display” and “positive affirmation of an alternative politics.”
He concluded, “Any adult who celebrates violence, destruction of property and physically threatening another human being has no business being employed by an educational institution. He completely crossed the line with his actions and his comments and he should be immediately terminated. Shame on him.”

They aren’t even keeping it a secret anymore. The Democrats want to buy our Congressional seat out from under us. Nancy Pelosi KNOWS how important NY-01 is to them keeping the House in November, which is why they’re POURING money into our district. She wants to put Radical Professor Nancy Goroff in Lee’s seat to act as her far-left puppet. We already have too many of those in Congress!
Alex, we can stop them. It took EVERYTHING we had to win in 2018, and this year, the far-left radicals are coming back harder than ever. But we can’t let them take the Long Island we know and love and turn it into a higher taxed socialist haven of eroded public safety and quality of life. This is why we’re asking for your donation TODAY to our Stop Radical Nancy Fund to help re-elect Lee.
Alex, we need you.

BREAKING NEWS: DEMOCRATS IMPEACH PRESIDENT TRUMP
Alex,
The Democrats did it.
After months of Adam Schiff’s scheming in the basement of the Capitol, the Democrats voted to impeach President Trump with ZERO crimes committed and NO impeachable offenses found.
This is completely outrageous! The Democrats and their media allies have been trying to spin-up allegations against President Trump since the day he won in 2016.
Alex, I’ve been fighting back against impeachment since day one. Now is not the time to give up; it’s time to double down fighting back against their ridiculous SCAMS and political schemes.
Join me in fighting back.
Rush in your emergency donation tonight >>
Fight Back
We cannot let the radical left get away with this.
I’m serious, I’ve never seen our country so divided. I’m standing by President Trump’s side and your side because our country is depending on him to keep us together during a time when the left has just ripped us apart.

In Case You Missed It…
[[URL REDACTED]] Launched Highlighting Radical Professor Nancy Goroff’s Anti-Police Rhetoric and Policies
[[URL REDACTED]] shines a spotlight on Goroff’s record of dangerous anti-police policies and statements in 2020, including:
• Calling the police “dangerous”
• Refusing to condemn the rioting, looting, and violence against police
• Calling for non-police to be sent in response to domestic violence crime scenes, instead of sending police
• Pushing legislation that would implement cashless bail nationwide and institute a massive prison release, including violent prisoners
• Refusing to support federal funding to help law enforcement eliminate MS-13
• Criticizing riot gear being given to police to respond to riots
Goroff is running against Congressman Lee Zeldin (R, NY-1) who, on the other hand, is a strong, outspoken, and unapologetic supporter of our law enforcement, military, first responders, and veterans.

ICYMI: Lee's First TV Ad
Image
ICYMI: Last week, I launched my first TV ad of this 2020 campaign for Congress. It's a 60 second ad, called ""Unapologetic"", about my support for our amazing law enforcement officers who risk their lives to keep our streets safe.
They deserve MORE support, not less, and certainly shouldn't be defunded. Many people even want to dangerously replace/prevent them from responding to calls at locations like domestic violence crime scenes!
The rioting, looting and violent attacks we have witnessed in US cities like New York City, Chicago, Seattle and Portland aren't what American streets should ever look like.
Now more than ever, we must support safety and security and our men and women in blue!

We are just 2 months from Election Day! None of us can spend any time at all on the sidelines with so much at stake for our country. As I mentioned at the end of my speech at the Republican National Convention last week, Keeping America Great is up to us and LOSING IS NOT AN OPTION!

EXCLUSIVE: Watch Lee’s New TV Ad Here First:
“Radical Professor”
Alex,
This is shocking. Instead of prioritizing safety and security, and law and order, in the midst of all the looting, rioting and violence targeting police and others on US city streets in recent months, Lee’s opponent, Radical Professor Nancy Goroff, is stabbing our police in the back!
Alex, you’re going to want to see this:
Alternate text
Radical Professor Nancy Goroff has fully embraced an extreme anti-law enforcement agenda:
* Calling the police ""damaging"" and ""dangerous""
* Saying that non-police should be sent to respond to domestic violence crime scenes instead of sending police
* Pushing legislation calling for a mass prison release, including violent criminals
* Complaining about riot gear being given to police to respond to violent riots
* Refusing to condemn the violence against police and others on U.S. city streets
Lee Zeldin, on the other hand, fully and unapologetically supports our police officers who put their lives on the line every day. Help Lee keep this new TV ad on air by donating $25 or more today!
Alex, we cannot reward the bad behavior of rioters and looters with more power in Washington. Politicians like Radical Professor Nancy Goroff are too weak to stand up AGAINST the far left and too weak to stand up FOR our amazing men and women in blue. Election Day is right around the corner, and we cannot take ANYTHING for granted.
100% of all donations the Zeldin for Congress campaign receives in response to this email will go directly to buying additional air time to get this message out to NY-1 voters ASAP! Can you chip in today?
It’s crucial that EVERYONE sees this ad. So Lee needs your URGENT help to keep it on air. Fight back and help us expose Radical Professor Nancy Goroff’s dangerous agenda >>>

Alex,
In the 50 days since Albany Democrats’ new Cashless Bail law has been in effect, an unprecedented number criminals have been instantly released back into our communities to commit more crimes.
Just last weekend in NYC, a thief thanked Democrats for releasing him after his 139th arrest saying, “Bail reform, it’s lit!... It’s the Democrats! The Democrats know me and the Republicans fear me. You can’t touch me! I can’t be stopped!”
This man had previously received several stints in prison and committed 6 felonies, 87 misdemeanors, and had 21 court hearings.
Alex, cashless bail does not need tiny changes... it needs a full repeal ASAP. Do you agree? Let Lee know here >>>
Instead of handcuffing criminals, Democrats are handcuffing Lady Justice, but I want to know where YOU stand, Alex.
Do you support the new Cashless Bail law?

Alex,
Over 14 law enforcement organizations just endorsed Congressman Lee Zeldin’s re-election campaign over his opponent. Why?
This is Lee’s radical opponent who thinks social workers should be sent to domestic violence crime scenes instead of police:
Alternate text
She even refuses to condemn any of the rioting in cities across America and attacks on our great men and women in blue.
Meanwhile, Congressman Zeldin, who grew up in a law enforcement household, strongly believes we should be supporting our police MORE, not less.
Lee said it best this week on Twitter: “What we are witnessing in Chicago, Portland, Seattle and NYC right now is a warning shot of what one party Democrat rule would look like throughout our great country with the radical left in charge.” He’s right and Lee urgently needs your support TODAY to fight back!

WATCH: ""Radical Professor""
Alternate text
I have always unapologetically supported our brave law enforcement officers. The many dangerous attacks right now on our law enforcement are an attack on the safety of every man, woman, and child in our communities and I'm not going to support any of it. The contrast between my opponent and I on this couldn't be any clearer. Radical Professor Nancy Goroff embraces anti-police proposals and rhetoric:
• Calls the police ""damaging"" and ""dangerous""
• Says that non-police should be sent to respond to domestic violence crime scenes instead of police
• Pushes legislation calling for a mass prison release, including violent criminals
• Complains about riot gear being given to police to respond to riots
• Refused to condemn the violence against police and others on US city streets
We cannot reward the bad behavior of rioters and looters with more power in Washington. We cannot give power to politicians like Goroff too weak to stand up AGAINST the far left and too weak to stand up FOR our amazing men and women in blue! Election Day is just around the corner on November 3rd and we cannot take absolutely anything for granted this year, especially with the awful crop of politicians who are running for Congress to continue propping up Nancy Pelosi as Speaker. Everything is at stake. This is the most important election of our lifetime and losing is not an option!

Growing up in a law enforcement home, Lee understands exactly how hard our law enforcement officers work to protect our communities. They put their lives on the line every single day, and as payback for their efforts, they are under attack by the left.
While crimes are skyrocketing, our opponent and the Democrats are working to defund our police officers. Our nation is at a true crossroads. Will we remain a free nation or will we become a crime-infested nation that defunds our police officers? Respond now >>>
De Blasio is leading New York down the path to completely defund the police and let violent criminals run wild and free. Our opponent will empower the same violent and radical agenda right here on Long Island.
For months, Lee has been warning us that this election is all about the fight against the rise of socialism and the radical left -- and now it’s knocking on our door.
Stop the Far Left

Alex,
Look at these tragic headlines: “Gun violence spikes in NYC”; “Multiple Weekend Shootings Continue Citywide Spike In Gun Violence”; and incredibly, “[NYC Mayor] de Blasio confirms HE’LL CUT $1B from NYPD budget.” Is de Blasio out of his mind?
Our local law enforcement needs MORE support as they risk their lives to protect our communities from these out-of-control mobs -- not LESS.
Giving into the radical “defund the police” movement only helps one group -- criminals.
Our police officers are under ATTACK, Alex, and that’s why it’s CRITICAL they know we have their backs. So I’m asking you to take a stand and sign our Back the Blue petition right now.
Back the Blue
Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York City Council members seem to believe the NYPD only goes after purse-snatchers and teenagers with fireworks. In reality, police officers have thwarted terrorist attacks, mass shootings, and violent crimes -- and saved countless innocent lives.
Let’s give our law enforcement our full support. Sign our petition today!
Thank you and a special thank you to those who continue to protect our communities,

Nancy Goroff calls police “dangerous.” She supports a bill that would enact cashless bail nationally and implement a massive prison release, including violent criminals like MS-13 gang members. Goroff has also refused to condemn the looting and violence against cops and believes that non-police should be sent to domestic violence crime scenes, instead of sending police.

1\. She called our brave law enforcement officers ""dangerous""[[URL REDACTED]]’s on video.
2\. She proposed “moving funding” and sending in non-police to respond to domestic violence crime scenes instead of sending [[URL REDACTED]]’s on video.
3\. She criticized riot gear being given to police to respond to riots...everyone has seen the picture.
4\. She refused to condemn looting, rioting, and violence against police during her law enforcement [[URL REDACTED]] is well documented by the Suffolk PBA.
5\. She supported a bill that would enact cashless bail nationally. It also contained a massive prison release, including violent [[URL REDACTED]] wrote an op-ed about her support for the bill and posted her support on Twitter.
6\. In a democratic primary debate, she was the only candidate on stage who would not commit to supporting federal funding to combat [[URL REDACTED]] on video.
No need to take my word on any of this. See the videos, pics, etc. for yourself at [[URL REDACTED]] I unapologetically support our men and women in blue and there is a zero percent chance my opponent is getting anything close to a free pass for her anti-police agenda.

Team Zeldin's New TV Ad
Amy Thomas is the Assistant Chief of the South Country Ambulance Company in Brookhaven. In our campaign's new TV ad, ""It's Personal"", Amy talks about the many ways I was delivering for our front line medical workers from the first moment the coronavirus pandemic reached Long Island earlier this year. Working with individuals at all levels of government and on both sides of the aisle, I secured over 1.2 million items of PPE in one month alone at the height of the pandemic, thousands of ventilators for New York, testing, funding, and more. My attitude then is the same as my attitude today that we should approach this pandemic not as Republicans First or Democrats First, but as Americans First and Long Islanders First.

Not only would a vote for the radical left mean a vote for socialized universal healthcare, cashless bail, free college and healthcare for illegal immigrants paid for by American tax dollars, requiring even higher taxes -- it would be a vote for a more dangerous New York.
Mayor de Blasio’s extreme policies and feckless leadership have forced more and more of New York’s law enforcement officers to get injured or retire early. Alex, this is extremely dangerous, especially since crime in New York has SKYROCKETED in the past few months. The far left wants to bring policies like de Blasio’s to Long Island.
It’s up to you now, Alex! Every dollar you donate will go towards fighting back against these policies.
Our August end-of-month fundraising deadline is coming up on Monday, and we’re $21,750 behind our goal. To help us get there, we are launching our Stop Radical Nancy Fund to take back the House. Help us reach our goal and Stop Nancy’s dangerous agenda from taking over our district and country.

Last week, House Democrats passed a bill enacting cashless bail nationally. Biden’s website brags that “Biden will lead a national effort to end cash bail.”
Here in NY, we’ve seen exactly how big of a disaster cashless bail has been. Criminals have been arrested, released on bail, and then arrested again on new crimes instantly. Oftentimes, they are arrested just HOURS or DAYS later. We’ve seen COUNTLESS examples of these types of DANGEROUS scenarios as a result of cashless bail. Help us fight back TODAY >>>
Kamala Harris was one of the original architects of cashless bail in California. Now she’s ready to take over the White House and expand cashless bail to the rest of the country. This is the most important election of our lifetimes -- losing is not an option. We MUST FIGHT BACK . . . and protect our cities.

I’m running for Congress to take on the big issues we’re facing now — access to affordable, quality healthcare, fair wages for all working families, a world-class education for everyone, and so much more.
These are difficult and historic times, and we can’t sit around and wait for change to happen — we have to make it happen. Ballots are starting to be mailed to Arkansas voters, if we’re going to make change happen it needs to be now.
I need your help, Alex. Our campaign needs to bring in 2,000 donations this week to prove our strength and charge full-steam ahead toward November. Can you chip in $20 toward our final goal before the first ballots are mailed?

My opponent is exactly what’s wrong with our broken system. He’s a rubber stamp for the Trump Administration and stands for corporate special interests — not everyday people, like you and me.
He’s voted to strip healthcare away from the most vulnerable in Arkansas. He’s voted to excuse Donald Trump’s blatant corruption and crimes. He’s even voted against critical relief funding during the worst pandemic in a century.
He’s simply too extreme for Northwest Arkansas.
But we can’t defeat him if we don’t put in the hard work. We can’t just plan on voting — we have to step up.
My team tells me we need another 1,459 donations before the weekend — can I count you in for a donation right now?

In 2016, he fooled far too many people into thinking he was a tough-talking success story who would “drain the swamp.” Four years later, the swamp has more snakes and he’s been revealed as a corrupt fraud.
What’s worse: so-called leaders like Steve Womack and Tom Cotton have lined up behind him to do his bidding, no matter what.

Alex,
The truth can't be ignored anymore – Nancy Pelosi and her House Democrats have become a dangerous threat to the rule of law!
By introducing their Articles of Impeachment, the Demcorats have launched an unprecedented and indiscriminate assault on President Trump with no regard to the Constitution.
The Democrats aren't waiting, they're hitting the gas on impeachment and we're struggling to keep pace. Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff have weaponized the impeachment process for their own hyper-partisan political goals and have even focus-grouped which crimes will appeal the most to voters!
Alex, I need your immediate support if I'm ever going to keep up with the Democrats' non-stop assault on the President and our nation. Please rush over $15, $20, $25 or even more to defend President Trump.
RUSH OVER $15 NOW

RUSH OVER EVEN MORE NOW
The Democrats will not let 2016 go and now they're tearing the country apart and shredding the Constitution along the way. The very foundation of our nation is at stake today.

# In Case Anyone Still Wants to Defund the Police…
July 7, 2020
Our Voice
Welcome to “Our Voice,” a brief 90-second review of the week featuring updates from our campaign and a look at the latest conservative news.
In Case Anyone Still Wants to Defund the Police…
The leftist mob wants you to believe defunding the police will help lead to equal justice. Newsflash, it doesn’t. Here is the reform we need to discuss: The violence and crime rate of cities with Democratic leaders. 77 people were shot just this past weekend in Chicago, 12 of them being under the age of 18. We see “Justice for George Floyd” plastered all over social media, but what about “Justice for Natalia Wallace?” Natalia Wallace, a sweet, 7-year-old child, was shot and killed the evening of July Fourth while playing outside with friends. No child should ever have to worry about being shot and killed while playing outside.
My heart absolutely breaks for Natalia Wallace, and other children like her who have suffered the same fate. We need to see real action come of these lawless acts of hatred and recklessness within our American cities. This needs to start with local leadership. Without well trained law enforcement, who follow proper procedures, we would only see crime rates across our country skyrocket. When will the left realize all the police are not the problem?

Let Our Children go Back to School 🚨
With all the coronavirus back and forth nowadays, one question still remains: Will our children be able to go back to school in the fall? President Trump has voiced his support for schools reopening in the fall, while national Democrats are declining to take a stand either way.
It is no secret our children need to go back to school. Unfortunately, the left is afraid to agree with this fact because it doesn’t fit their “destroy Trump” narrative. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) expressed their concerns with students not returning to the classroom this fall. Virtual classrooms not only hinder a child’s educational experience, but also affect their social skills and the irreplaceable lessons they learn within the classroom. We can find a way to keep our teachers and children safe while still having them learn.

# Chaos on the Left ⬅️ Prosperity on the Right ➡️
June 12, 2020
Our Voice
Welcome to “Our Voice,” a brief 90-second review of the week featuring updates from our campaign and a look at the latest conservative news.
Chaos on the Left ⬅️ Prosperity on the Right ➡️
Support law enforcement graphic Eric Esshaki
Leading Democrats, including Representative Haley Stevens, refuse to denounce the chaos spreading. We all want justice, but we also want our rights to be protected. When businesses had their warehouses burned during the riots, their rights were not protected. And when store owners had merchandise looted from their stores, their rights were not protected either.
Even so, Haley Stevens refuses to denounce crazy ideas like defunding the police. Stevens' ally, Governor Whitmer, has even alluded to supporting the movement. This idea is not only preposterous, it's also dangerous. Research shows that in areas where police minimized contact with civilians following riots, crime and homicides increased.
You can grieve for George Floyd and want to hold bad police accountable, and still support law enforcement. Americans want fairness, justice and safety FOR ALL. The left-wing politicians want us to choose one or the other.
Ironically, while the left supports sabotaging our streets, President Trump is managing to restore our economy. In May, unemployment dropped and 2.5 million jobs were added. We have chaos and lawlessness on the left, and peace and prosperity on the right. Come November, we will show which side we support.

The Hypocrisy is Infuriating 😠
Remember when Gov. Whitmer stripped us of our basic constitutional rights in the name of social distancing? It seems there is a double standard when liberals want to enact their agenda. This week, Gov. Whitmer violated her own social distancing guidelines to attend a protest. Photos show her within six feet of other protestors, in direct violation of her own website’s recommendations.
The barber who had his license stripped for opening during the lockdown is likely feeling very frustrated right now. The same could be said for the hundreds of other small business owners struggling to make ends meet. Gov. Whitmer said that elections matter. On that, Gov. Whitmer, we agree. We need more leaders who put people before their own agenda.

# Constitutional Rights Matter - Even in Times of Crisis ✅
May 30, 2020
Our Voice
Welcome to “Our Voice.” A brief 90 second review of the week that features updates from our campaign and a look at the latest conservative news.
Constitutional Rights Matter - Even in Times of Crisis ✅
This week, I discussed the issues that matter to us on Bill Mitchell’s show Campaign Corner. We covered everything from our successful lawsuit against Governor Whitmer, to what inspired me to run for Congress in the first place. It all comes down to my respect for our Constitution and the need to revert to it regardless of the circumstance.
Our triple win against liberal Governor Whitmer demonstrated even in times of crisis, constitutional rights still matter. Opening up the economy, while ensuring the well being of those at risk, is an important step in protecting our rights to work and support our families. My opponent, Congresswoman Haley Stevens does not respect these values. Her record of voting with Nancy Pelosi 100% of the time shows she supports big government and minimizing our liberties. We need to revert to conservative principles of hard work, not handouts. It’s time for a change.

This is Why Democrats Want to Extend Lockdown 😠
Jason Furman, one of former President Barack Obama's top economic advisers, gave a presentation to top Democratic strategists and donors last month, during which he shared “some of the best economic data in the history of the country.” The crowd was shocked and thought he had misspoken.
As President Trump pushes to reopen, advisers to Joe Biden are concerned that a bounce back in the economy could take away a weapon they planned to use against President Trump. “This is my big worry,” one former adviser to Obama told POLITICO. Americans are aware it’s the President’s removal of regulations and taxes that brought about measures such as the lowest unemployment rate in half a century and it is these same policies that will bring our economy back to where it needs to be.

Friend —
This morning, House and Senate Democrats announced a new bill that could bring transformative change in policing. I am proud to join the Congressional Black Caucus, the House Judiciary Committee, and Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris in helping introduce this critical piece of legislation.
Now, I am calling on Mitch McConnell to allow this bill to the floor for a vote. But, I need your help to send a powerful message to Washington. Can you sign my petition to demand this bill gets heard on the Senate floor?
SIGN MY PETITION
Our work is to root out the culture of racism and abuse of power at the heart of a system that allows the Black community and so many other marginalized communities to be killed, abused, and harassed by law enforcement over and over again.
The bill includes the following changes to police policy:
* Create a federal registry for police misconduct and require states to report use of force to the Department of Justice;
* Ban chokeholds and carotid holds and only allocate funding to state and local jurisdictions that end these practices;
* End the use of “no-knock” warrants that often lead to deadly use of force by officers and make funding contingent on ending the use of these warrants;
* Give state attorneys general the power to hold police accountable for eliminating the culture of racism and violence in their departments, and to conduct independent investigations of the use of force;
* Enact mandatory racial and implicit bias training for police officers and condition federal funding to departments based on them providing this training;
* Strictly limit the transfer of military-grade weaponry to police departments;
* Make lynching a federal hate crime;
* And changes “qualified immunity” to make it easier for people to be able to sue police officers for civil rights violations.
The Justice in Policing Act of 2020 is a good and important start in enacting much-needed change to federal policy around policing. We need to pass this legislation in both the House and the Senate — and we’ll need your help to do so.
The protests of the last few weeks have made it clear that Americans are demanding change and accountability now. Can you make your voice heard and sign my petition right now? It is so important.
SIGN MY PETITION
I know this bill is just the beginning. But I think it’s a very important first step. We have a lot of work to do, and I am more committed than ever to this fight.
Thank you for consistently taking action. I am proud to have you on this team.

I must admit that I am a little ashamed that I am writing you an email about making lynching a federal crime in the year 2020. I believe this is something that should have been in place a long time ago, but here we are. To make matters worse, there’s a bipartisan bill in the U.S. Senate right now that would make this happen, but it’s being held up by petty partisan politics.
The bill was passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the House in February. Now we need the Senate to follow their lead. Add your name today to help urge the Senate to pass this vital legislation so we can make lynching a federal hate crime.
SIGN THE PETITION
The Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act is named in honor of Emmett Till, a young Black boy who was brutally murdered in Money, Mississippi in 1955. Emmett was visiting Mississippi from Chicago for the summer, and was accused of whistling at a white woman in a store. Till was taken from his home by a mob in the night and brutally beaten and thrown in a river.
His body was so mutilated that it was recommended that his casket remain closed for the service. Our family business, Century Funeral Home, helped transport Emmett’s body back to Chicago. Despite recommendations against showing Emmett’s body, his mother, Mamie Till, decided she wanted the world to see what those men did to her son. Emmett Till’s open casket made the front page of newspapers across the world, but even that didn’t help his family see justice delivered. His killers were never found guilty.
We need the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act to become law so we can make sure no other family has to live knowing that justice wasn’t served for the racially-motivated killing of their loved one. Please add your name today so we can help make this a reality.
SIGN THE PETITION
2020 isn’t over yet, and we have already experienced headlines, videos, and live footage of racial violence. Making lynching a federal crime is still a necessity today. We must do everything possible to protect the lives of everyone and help make sure no one in this country feels unsafe.
Thanks for all you do.

Change is happening not just here in Mississippi, but in states all across the South. In South Carolina and Georgia, my fellow Black Democratic candidates Jaime Harrison and Rev. Raphael Warnock are also running people-powered campaigns for the U.S. Senate.
The November election is our chance to elect bold new leaders in the South to take our country forward. That’s why my brothers and I wrote an op-ed for BET sharing our vision for a New South, and I wanted to make sure you saw it.
But first, real quick, is there any chance you can chip in just $10 to our campaign to help us win in Mississippi and build a New South together?
In the Deep South, recent calls for equality and equity in the way our law enforcement treats American citizens have ricocheted from state to state — from the quiet streets of rural towns like Loganville, Georgia and Petal, Mississippi, to the glittering metropolises that drive our Southern economies.
These watershed moments of public outcry are a sign of people feeling unheard and underrepresented, and decisions our leaders make today can have wide-ranging impacts on the lived experiences of Black Americans. For the first time in history, we’re seeing people in all 50 states stand together to protest the racial injustices that have become all too common in our country.
Representation matters. And for its entire history, the United States Senate has failed to represent the racial diversity of our nation. This is particularly notable for states in the Deep South, which feature some of the largest Black populations in the United States. Yet since Reconstruction, the Deep South has only sent one African-American to the United States Senate.
Our same states, the ones we call home, have a long history of sordid racial legacies. We know it all too well as men who grew up under laws designed to keep people like us from having a seat at the table. Those public policies for decades have either forgotten Black communities or willfully ignored them. Schools in African-American areas are underfunded, and communities of color are at higher risk to have dilapidated infrastructure, like water systems across the rural Deep South with high lead levels.
Gone are poll taxes and grandfather clauses, but voting rights continue to be under attack in far more secretive, subversive ways like Voter ID laws. Black Americans in the South are punished with harsher sentences compared to white Americans, who commit the same crime. Look no further than the coronavirus pandemic to see this inequality in full form. Hospitalization rates for Black Americans with COVID are five times the rate of white Americans sick with the virus.
But, at this pivotal moment in our nation, we have the unique opportunity before us to turn momentum into results — to turn chants on the streets into laws on the books.
Our campaigns represent the rising of a New South that is bold, inclusive, and forward-looking. The kind of South — and a Deep South in particular — that can move past the darkest chapters of our history and look towards a future that leaves nobody behind. To deliver this change, we need to change who represents us.
You can help change who represents the people of Mississippi in the U.S. Senate this November: Make a contribution of $10 or whatever you can to support me in my race to replace Cindy Hyde-Smith and usher in a new era for the Magnolia State and the South as a whole.

I wanted to take a moment today to honor Medgar Evers, one of Mississippi's fiercest champions of justice. He was assassinated in his driveway 57 years ago today by a white supremacist.
Evers was the Mississippi NAACP State Conference’s first field secretary. In this position, Medgar traveled across the state to local NAACP branches helping to fight racial descrimination and injustice because of Jim Crow laws in Mississippi. He investigated lynchings, recorded hate crimes, and recruited Mississippians to the NAACP. This was an extremely dangerous job to have at the time, but Medgar persisted.
Medgar Evers
Medgar was mentored by T.R.M Howard, who was president of the Regional Council of Negro Leadership in (RCNL) in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. Here, he was trained in activism, and as an insurance salesman he was able to travel across the state and witness injustice against Black Mississippians.
Medgar helped to plan and execute many boycotts against white merchants who discriminated against Black patrons. He was influential in James Meredith's integration of the University of Mississippi. Evers himself tried to integrate the University of Mississippi Law school in 1954, but was shut out.
He was a supporter of student activism and assisted in student-led sit-ins across the state, and in the City of Jackson (where his office is still located). And that office is still used today by the current executive director of the Mississippi NAACP State Conference.
Medgar was a war veteran, had three children, and was married to his college classmate, Myrlie. Myrlie Evers-Williams is a civil rights icon in her own right, and I am deeply grateful to call her a friend.
Medgar Evers is a true Mississippi hero. We still feel his loss today, but his legacy lives on in all of us fighting for a new Mississippi.
Thanks for all you do.

I’ve spent the past couple weeks listening, reflecting, and participating in the peaceful protests calling for an end to police brutality against Black Americans here in Jackson.
This subject weighs heavily on my mind and heart, and I wanted to take a few minutes to share my thoughts with you about what reforms I believe are needed in order to effect change and truly ensure that Black Lives Matter within our criminal justice system and society as a whole.
Before I share my thoughts, I want to ask: Will you join me in the call for police reform by adding your name alongside mine today?
ADD YOUR NAME
My brother-in-law is an African-American cop who patrols a New Orleans suburban community. He speaks to me often of his perilous duty. He has encountered most of the difficulties and challenges inherent in being a law enforcement officer in today’s America.
But as a Black man, he understands the sordid history of hate and violence in this country that has been disproportionately directed at Black Americans. To be sure, he has read about and reflected on the recent tragedies of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and the countless others over the course of years. And he is acutely and painfully aware that centuries of racial bias continue to contribute to the worst outcomes in encounters with many law enforcement officers across our country.
What happened to George Floyd is an abomination. Four Minneapolis policemen used excessive force to cause his death in what appears to be a tragically cavalier fashion. All four officers involved should be held fully accountable and incarcerated for their crimes.
The public outcry generated by the horribly graphic video of Floyd’s death quickly became international in scope, eclipsing even the global pandemic. The call for changes to our established policing structure has perhaps never been more forceful.
So, what are we to do now that we have reached this inflection point? How do we make sure that we have more officers who value Black life and where the numerous episodes of tragic and obvious police misconduct will no longer occur?
I believe there are a number of clear steps.
First, we need to hire more officers of color, especially Black men and women. We can attract more applicants by offering competitive salaries and opportunities for continuing education.
Second, applicants and new hires should be subject to stringent background checks on past conduct and previous performance. Greater transparency is the easiest and simplest solution to prevent officers who have previously been in trouble from getting new jobs. That’s why we must create a national registry of police misconduct and disciplinary actions. State and local police departments should also be required to report use-of-force incidents to the Department of Justice.
Third, we must mandate bias and de-escalation training. I also want our police officers to receive training from our mental health counselors, social workers, child protection officers, and addiction specialists. On a daily basis, officers are confronted with situations involving these afflictions- some are violent, but many are not. We shouldn’t try to turn policemen into social workers, but they should at least understand that not all offenders belong in jail. Some may need mental health treatment, others may require referral to drug treatment, or other alternatives might be in order. I want our departments to work hand-in-hand with these experts so they can better understand these situations in order to better serve our communities.
Fourth, chokeholds and other restraint positions that can reduce blood and airflow should be abolished. We must create a new prevailing standard of conduct in which the unacceptable standard of “reasonable force” is replaced with “necessary force.”
Fifth, all officers in all locales should be required to wear body cameras and officers should be forbidden from turning them off while on duty.
I believe the opportunity for change is upon us — in Mississippi and across the nation. Young leaders have stepped up, and we more seasoned leaders must not step aside. We have to stay in the fight. That’s why I was proud to peacefully march last Saturday with the organizers of Black Lives Matters of Mississippi, alongside my wife and two sons.
And I would be even prouder to work with them from the halls of the U.S. Senate. We need leadership for this new age. Someone who will listen to everyone, who will show up to march for all the good and just causes — someone who will help to fuse the coalition of youthful passion with the judgment of those who have been around, and who have “seen some things.” We need someone who will work with everyone regardless of race, age, gender, religion or sexual orientation, and who can help set a positive course for Mississippians.
Dr. W.E.B. DuBois lamented that the central problem of the 20th century was “the color line.” Unfortunately, as we embark upon the third decade of the 21st century his assessment still holds true. But, working together we can change this. Through commitment, cooperation, and the enactment of no nonsense solutions, we can get to a place that works for all of us.
Join me in committing to the fight for justice and calling for these clear, necessary reforms to policing in America: Add your name now.
ADD YOUR NAME

651,"You are wanted, you are valued and I will fight for you.
Dear Alex,
My opponent is fueling hatred and peddling division during a time when we all need to be on the same team. This time against Asian-Americans.
I am often shocked by Congressman Balderson’s votes. Truly. They absolutely shock me.
Especially those who are bent on oppression of women and minorities. But a vote he made just yesterday takes the cake and has me once again wondering in disbelief “how could he vote against that?”
Yesterday our soon to be unemployed Congressman voted against a Resolution that would ensure protections against Asian-Americans from the dramatic spike of hate crimes against them.
The Resolution provides examples of the horrific spike in anti-Asian violence since COVID hit including the attack of a woman at a New York City subway, two children and two adults stabbed at a grocery store in Texas, and a 16-year-old boy sent to the hospital in California after an attack by bullies.
The Resolution also condemns the use of phrases like “Chinese Virus” or “Wuhan Virus” or “Kung Flu”.
House Resolution 908 also:
* Condemns all manifestations of expressions of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, anti-Asian sentiment, scapegoating, and ethnic or religious intolerance;
* Calls on Federal law enforcement officials, working with State and local officials— to expeditiously investigate and document all credible reports of hate crimes and incidents and threats against the Asian-American community in the United States.
* Recommits the United States leadership to build a more inclusive, diverse and tolerant society. Full resolution here.
Again, I ask … who votes against a resolution like this?
Troy Balderson does.
Balderson is telling us exactly who he is and with every vote he casts the picture becomes clearer. This man is one of the most conservative and far-right members of Congress who votes with Trump 95.6% of the time.
He is someone who does not want to grow, to change or to accept fault for any of his actions or, more accurately, inactions. He is someone who will always be looking backward, not forward. And he is definitely no leader.
Asian-Americans make up a large and growing part of our Ohio District. There is no doubt in my mind many of them are reading this Resolution right now and for them, I can’t even imagine the gut punch to see that their Congressman voted against it.
To them I say, please don’t let this discourage you.
The men and women who voted for this bill are protected by Gerrymandered Districts and they do not reflect the feelings of a majority of Ohioans. In fact, they represent a minority. But thanks to a rigged system they are in positions of power. Soon, however, very soon, at least one of them will be out of a job.
Hang in there, friends.
We want you here, we welcome you here. We know this virus is not your fault. In fact, we know this virus’ rampant spread across our country is due to our own leaders failing us and by no means tied to you.
You make our country more beautiful, more diverse and stronger simply because of your presence. Our home is now yours and I am proud to call you my sisters and brothers and my fellow Americans.
To Troy, you astonish me, you embarrass me as a constituent, and in just a few short weeks we’ll be putting an end to your cowardice.

652,"Enough is enough. It's time to throw them out.
It seems we are all hanging on by a thread, just trying to make sure the country we know and love has a fighting chance to survive.
So many things are hanging in the balance and it is hard not to feel completely overwhelmed.
Our health.
Our economy.
And now, our civil liberties.
As we battle multiple fronts as a nation, the President of the United States continues to lead without a plan and my opponent continues to obediently follow him. At all costs.
It’s like watching a slow-moving train wreck. And guys like Troy Balderson and Donald Trump are going to drive us off of a cliff.
This morning, Troy sent an email chastising protestors for breaking windows in Downtown Columbus. Yes, clearly, we can all agree broken windows are not okay, but you cannot equate that to the murder of an innocent black man by a police officer hired to protect him from violence. In order to prevent more senseless deaths, elected officials like Troy need to act.
For centuries, years, months and now days – our country's systemic racism has gone unanswered. We need solutions, we need peacemakers, we need bravery and courage to have tough conversations. But above all, we need action.
There are immediate steps, right now, that our legislators at the local, state and federal level can make to address violent crimes against communities of color. Here's one example: a federal law banning chokeholds or strangleholds. We can also invest far more time during police training on the de-escalation of violence. We must do better and equip our officers with the tools and knowledge they need to protect and preserve life. And last but not least, we must try and convict police officers who kill unarmed black men, women and children to the fullest extent of the law. Period. End of story.
This all must end now.
If you can give, here are just a few of the organizations that are working to support our communities of color: NAACP, Southern Poverty Law Center, and The Color of Change.
In the end, on November 4th, we will all wake up and know we did everything we possibly could when history laid down her challenge. And Troy Balderson will not be counted in that tally. He is sitting this one out, so let’s throw him out.

654,"Greetings,
Here are 3 alarming facts about the Criminal Justice system in Oklahoma:
1. Oklahoma still has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world.
2. 20% of our inmates are housed in private for-profit prisons.
3. We are not seeing returns when it comes to public safety or inmate rehabilitation.
It's clear that we've built a system that is neither functioning nor sustainable, and it's time to stop pouring money into it.
As your Senator, I'll take a multi-pronged approach to fighting for a system that works. I'll advocate to reduce sentences for low-level drug crimes and invest in trauma-informed rehabilitation and mental health services.
Donate to my campaign today and be a part of the change!

655,"Dear Friends,
I often get asked what separates me from other candidates in this race.
The answer is simple: I have spent my entire life working and raising my family in CD 2 and Eastern Oregon.
I was born and raised here. I grew up working on my family’s ranch near Drewsey, went to college in La Grande and own, operate and live on a farm near Ontario. I have always voted as a resident of CD2.
Not only did I grow up here, but I developed a set of conservative values that were rare in Salem and even more rare in Washington DC.
I have always stood up for life & the unborn. I have been consistently supported by Oregon Right to Life in my previous elections. In fact, the last bill I asked be drafted in the Oregon Legislature was based upon a request from Oregon Right to Life.
The 2nd amendment is something I have never compromised on. It doesn't matter if you are riding fences or walking in downtown Portland, we all have the right to defend ourselves. When I helped lead the “Oregon 11” on the walkout that denied the super-majority democrats a quorum and killed the disastrous cap-and-trade bill, we also stopped the democrats’ all-out assault on our Second Amendment rights when we killed Senate Bill 978. If you recall, SB 978 would have imposed strict liability on those whose guns were stolen and used for a crime, among other provisions.
Water issues and policies are areas I am very familiar with and have worked on for more than half my life. President Trump also recognizes the importance of water to rural economies and communities. So when Governor Kate Brown advocates for removing the four lower Snake River dams, you bet I will push back against her Portland radical environmentalist agenda.
As we know in CD 2, the Pacific Northwest's intricate dam system is vital to the survival of our communities, our livelihoods and the transportation of our crops. We are making continued advancements that protect and help the fish, particularly salmon, that are part of this ecosystem.
I vow to protect and fight in Washington DC for these four dams and the hundreds of other dams that our communities, economies, and environment depend upon.
As your next Congressman in CD 2, I will remain true to the Rural & Eastern Oregon values I was raised with and you can trust me to vote in Washington just as I talk in Oregon.
Thank you for your support!
Sincerely,
CLIFF BENTZ

Typical of a 40+ year career politician who has done NOTHING to help her crumbing district, she has ignored my challenge.
But while Maxine Waters is hiding from me, she’s sending gangsters and thugs to my events to harass me and my supporters.

Maxine Waters doesn’t care about our community, and she certainly doesn’t care about black lives.
She’s getting rich off of making a career out of viscously attacking President Trump and conservatives like you and me.
Meanwhile, her failed socialist policies have only resulted in more poverty, joblessness, homelessness, crime and violence in our district.
That’s what Maxine Waters has done to my home, and that’s what she’ll do to the rest of the country if we don’t remove her from office – which is why I need your support today.
Maxine Waters needs to face me and her constituents and answer for her failures. I need your help to flush Maxine out of hiding and force her to debate me – then I need your help to defeat her.

Alex,
We are in the middle of a crisis. But it is important to remember that the Democrats are exploiting that crisis to try to pass the Green New Deal and if they take back the Senate this Fall, that’s what they’ll do.
That is why I am writing on behalf of my friend Senator Steve Daines, a conservative Republican from Montana.
Steve is tough on crime, he stands up to China, and he’s against illegal immigration. He’s being challenged by failed presidential candidate Steve Bullock who is weak on China and wants open borders.
And this race will be close. If we lose in Montana, the Republican Senate majority will be gone.
Donate NOW to help protect the Republican Senate Majority.
I am asking you to make a contribution to Steve Daines’ campaign. 100% of what you donate will go to help Daines win Montana and help us keep the Senate.
We can’t afford to lose a good conservative like Steve Daines – especially to radical liberal Steve Bullock who is weak on China.
Steve will fight back against the left-wing mob and their radical agenda and that’s why they are going to spend MILLIONS to defeat him.
Will you chip in $5, $25, $50 or even $100 to help hold the Senate Majority and help my friend Senator Steve Daines?
There is so much at stake in this election and the liberal mob is more fired up than ever to defeat Trump Conservatives all across the country.
Republicans are being outraised and outspent. With November fast approaching we need to catch up and ensure we have the resources to fight back and expand our Senate Majority.
Democrats know that their path to the Senate Majority runs through Montana.
If Steve Daines loses in Montana – Chuck Schumer will become Senate Majority leader and the liberal mob will have total control.
We cannot let that happen.
Donate NOW to help protect the Republican Senate Majority.
In service,

seen this?
Alex,
Our LAST end-of-quarter fundraising deadline is just one week away. I can't believe Election Day is so close and yet we are still fighting tooth and nail to meet our critical fundraising goals.
Frankly, that's why I am reaching out today. I need to raise $32,427 in the next 7 DAYS to combat the Democrats' attacks.
HELP DEBBIE REACH HER GOAL ➔
The radical-Left hates that I am standing for LAW AND ORDER in our communities. They don't want to see our families safe... they want to allow rioters and looters to burn our cities to the ground.
Just last week, I introduced the Holding Rioters Accountable Act of 2020, which would allow the attorney general to withhold up to ten percent of Department of Justice (DOJ) grants from cities, states, and other local governments that fail to prosecute crimes that arose from riots and other violent protests.
I am in Washington fighting for this bill to become a law, campaigning is not my first priority – the safety of your family is.
But there is still an election in 41 days. Which is why I need your financial support today to keep me fighting for you in the House. Will you make an urgent donation of $15 or more right now to help me reach my critical goal?
HELP DEBBIE REACH HER GOAL ➔

Wendy Davis for Congress
Friend, more than 6,000 Texans have already lost their lives to COVID-19. Last week, FEMA refrigerator trucks were delivered here because many of our morgues have run out of room to store the bodies of those who have lost their battle with this devastating virus. This is the very definition of a crisis, and it's happening here in our own backyard.
And yet what has Donald Trump's response been? Attacking the person actually trying to do something about it.
Dr. Anthony Fauci has been telling us hard truths since the start of this pandemic. He's the guy that puts science first – and he's not afraid to stand up to this administration when they're behaving in ways that put our lives in danger.
But Trump has repeatedly denied the science and discredited Dr. Fauci. Worse still? He's got rank-and-file Republicans like Chip Roy backing him up. Chip went on the offensive against a Republican congresswoman who spoke out in support of Dr. Fauci – as if trusting one of the world's experts on infectious diseases is some sort of political crime.
This is a pandemic, not political theater. So I'm calling on Donald Trump and Chip Roy to depoliticize this crisis and stop the attacks on Dr. Fauci – and I'm asking 585 concerned people like you to join me before midnight tonight.
Add your name right now: Tell Donald Trump and Chip Roy to stop the attacks on Dr. Fauci!

RE: Janicek Car Stolen
Earlier this week, Democratic Candidate for United States Senate Chris Janicek had his car stolen in broad daylight. “I was loading an order for Union Pacific in the middle of the day outside the shop on 50th, and someone jumped in my Honda element and made off with my car speeding north with the hatch open.” said Janicek.
Janicek filed last week to run for the United States Senate seat currently held by Republican Ben Sasse.
Janicek commented, “Thank goodness there was only one tray of cupcakes in the car. If there were anymore, if would have been a real tragedy” he said with a smile. The candidate later reported the theft to OPD who followed up an official file and a suggestion to post the incident on Facebook.
“Things like this shouldn’t happen anywhere…” Janicek continued. “Especially not here in the great state of Nebraska!” Janicek said it is up to us all to be watchful and to have each other’s back. The most recent Omaha statistics showed 4,079 annual vehicle thefts. According to recently released FBI crime statistics, the area's rate of about 442 vehicle thefts per 100,000 residents ranked 18th among the 100 most-populous cities.
“Crime happens in Omaha and it happens in Scottsbluff but we are all in this together. So, let’s watch out for everyone and have a safe and happy new year.” Janicek concluded.

665,"For Roger Williams to cartoonishly deny his participation when a reporter was standing right there and saw the whole thing is a failure and it’s hugely embarrassing for Texas.
# Julie Oliver for Congress
Team,
Women face misogyny doing the most innocuous things imaginable. So it's unsurprising — but profoundly disappointing — that Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was attacked with misogynistic, vulgar language by two of her colleagues while on her way to vote yesterday morning.
Representative Ted Yoho yelled in her face, used a sexist slur, and stalked off angrily — all because Rep. Ocasio-Cortez had the temerity to note the well-established link between poverty and crime.
The other colleague standing beside Yoho while he ranted was Roger Williams, Julie's Republican opponent. He claimed he had no involvement in the exchange, to which Rep. Ocasio-Cortez replied that he not only observed the abuse and failed to intervene, he actively participated, screaming something about “throwing urine” at the Congresswoman.
Headline
At this point, this just feels all too familiar. A woman speaks truth to power, and those who feel threatened explode about it.
For Roger Williams to cartoonishly deny his participation when a reporter was standing right there and saw the whole thing is a failure and it's hugely embarrassing for Texas.
But this transcends politics.
Too many women face sexist abuse just like this in their own workplaces. Too many men feel entitled to attack and dismiss women with ugly slurs and sexist language.
We have to change the culture of toxicity and dysfunction that has captured our politics, and our society. We're working hard to elect a representative like Julie who will lead, not follow — and it's why we hope you'll join us and support our campaign today.
CONTRIBUTE $5
The people of this district — the women of this district, many of whom have faced similar sexist abuse — deserve so much better.
Misogyny has no place in any workspace, much less the United States Congress. The first step toward ending that culture is ousting people like Roger Williams and sending more women who are unafraid to speak truth to power to Congress.
That's why we're going to continue fighting every day to win this election, and why we hope you'll stand with us all the way until November.
Thanks for being in this fight with us,
Team Julie

America is experiencing a moment of national anguish, as we grieve for the Black Americans killed by police brutality.
I know you might be feeling overwhelmed at the moment.
My heart grieves for every single victim of police violence, too.

That’s why, at this very moment, Democrats and I are working tirelessly to end police brutality.
We need to hold police more accountable, make lynching a federal crime, address systemic racial discrimination, and de-militarize the police.
But I need your help to demand this change.
I’m asking Alex -- from the bottom of my heart -- for you to sign my urgent petition DEMANDING an end to police brutality. Help me turn our collective outrage into action. >>

Alex,
Cutting public safety budgets has officially begun, as cowardly politicians in California and New York bow down to the liberal mob and abandon their fundamental responsibility to protect people. Los Angeles politicians slashed $145 million from the Sheriff's Department - targeting the gang unit, human trafficking, crimes involving children, rape, and major crimes bureau. New York City's Mayor De Blasio goes further and cuts the NYPD by a billion dollars as shootings and violent crime surge.
Make no mistake, liberals nationwide will want to use this as a model to defund any organization that protects law and order. We will NOT allow politicians to cut police budgets and let criminals loose. We should be DEFENDING the police, not defunding them. Please stand with me to tell the left that we will not defund our police units!

Liberals are intent on taking the police officers who protect and serve off the streets while leaving criminals on the streets. This is completely backward: we must DEFEND our men and women who serve as police and first responders, not defund them. It’s up to us to to stand up to the anarchist mob.
SAY NO TO DEFUNDING THE POLICE!

Alex,
I'd like to tell you a story about Jon that you may not know. Nearly three years ago, I began doing some work in the community to stop domestic violence. A woman and her four-year old child had been murdered by her ex-boyfriend, who then killed himself. The case made an imprint on me. A mother and her child were dead. There was a vigil and some media coverage of the deaths, but nobody seemed to be asking many questions.
I had been prosecuting domestic violence cases for about four years at that time and believed more could be done in the community to stop interpersonal violence. I began meeting with experts in the field in Kalamazoo and throughout Michigan, learning about the role that trauma, and witnessing or experiencing violence as a child has on people who go on to become abusive themselves. I learned that suffering trauma is the leading indicator that a person will hurt someone else.
First, we wrestled with the question of which action or set of actions to take to create real change in the community. We knew that trauma contributed significantly to interpersonal violence in the community, but we weren't sure how to address it. After much discussion, the answer came in the form of a new treatment court - a court that treated trauma as a root cause of crime and family violence. Just as Drug Courts treat addiction to reduce crime and recidivism, this court program would treat trauma to reduce violence perpetration. The concept became known as the Kalamazoo County Trauma & Resiliency Court, a first of its kind endeavor in our country.
Next, we were faced with the question of where to turn to provide funding for trauma survivors and their families. Treatment for trauma survivors would help reduce interpersonal violence in the community, but as we all know, treatment costs money. And trauma survivors often lack the resources to pay for quality treatment out of pocket. Particularly, the kind of treatment that effectively calms trauma reactivity and heals families in the process.
Jon Hoadley answered the call. I met with Jon to discuss our efforts and he immediately offered to help. He fought for, and won, funding in the state legislature to create the new treatment court program in Kalamazoo County.
The Trauma & Resiliency Court program will fundamentally change the way we understand and treat trauma survivors in the community, offering survivors help and healing, instead of more pain and punishment. It will mean fewer trauma victims and more resilience in and through the justice system.
I want you to know the critical role Jon played in helping trauma survivors in this community. Nobody has ever done anything like this anywhere in the country or, so far as I know, the world. Unfortunately, the voices of trauma survivors are often ignored in the criminal justice system, as this survivor details in this piece. They repeatedly ask for more resources to treat and heal trauma, but are instead given pain and punishment. Jon is helping to end this injustice in Kalamazoo and bend the arc just a little more.
This is yet one more reason to support Jon Hoadley with your time and money. Jon is doing more for trauma survivors in this community than Upton ever has or ever will. He is quietly, but fundamentally, changing the way we view and treat survivors in the justice system.
I hope you’ll join me in supporting Jon’s campaign.
In politics these days, we too often see the mean and the ugly, the distortion of truth, hurtful words and misdeeds that have come to define the Trump era. Upton, through the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), benefits from this kind of politics.
Jon is different. Jon cares about people. Jon cares about this community. He's fighting for Kalamazoo in Lansing each and every day, and will do the same in Washington, D.C. when we send him to Congress this November. Let's help him get there.
I know this was a long email. If you've gotten to this line, thank you. Let's give Jon the best thanks we can in the coming weeks by voting to retire Upton.
Sincerely yours,
Joe

Over the past few years, more than 20 states have passed new laws restricting how people can buy and carry guns in response to our nation’s epidemic of gun violence.
Over the past few years, more than 20 states have passed new laws restricting how people can buy and carry guns in response to our nation’s epidemic of gun violence.
But these common-sense reforms are undermined by gun trafficking made possible by looser gun laws in neighboring states -- about 50,000 guns are diverted to criminals across state lines every year, and it’s likely that many more go undetected.
That’s why Sean helped introduce the Gun Trafficker Detection Act, which would require gun owners to report a lost or stolen gun within 48 hours.
This legislation will help law enforcement identify and prosecute traffickers, who often claim their gun was lost or stolen when it turns up at a crime scene in another state -- and hold them liable for any damage done by their guns!
'I'm tired of hearing lawmakers offer their 'thoughts and prayers' after every new report of a tragic mass shooting. It's time to offer Americans smart, effective gun laws that will save lives.' - Sean Casten

As we take steps to address the institutionalized racism and violence that corrupts America’s justice system, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020, a critical set of reforms to make law enforcement officials more accountable to the communities they serve.
The bill will:
* remove barriers to prosecuting police officers and recover damages from officers who have violated civilians' rights;
* require body and dashboard cameras, ban chokeholds, and end no-knock warrants in drug cases;
* demilitarize the police by cutting the transfer of military weapons to state and local police departments;
* compile additional, more accurate, data of police brutality to hold officers publicly accountable;
* increase pressure on the Justice Department to actually tackle systemic racial discrimination by law enforcement; and
* make lynching a federal crime, building on the House's passage of the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act earlier this year.
We cannot take this for granted. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020 is still just a proposal. We need to make it the law of the land and then keep on going. Please add your voice to the chorus of Americans who are demanding real change, who refuse to go back to the same old way of doing things.
And then we keep moving forward, knowing that the broader, deeper conversation about race and the legacy of slavery in our country must be honestly embraced by every person of good will, but knowing as well that conversation alone is not enough.
Justice demands action.

Today is the two-year anniversary of the tragic shooting that took the lives of five staff members of the Capital Gazette. As one who has had the privilege of representing Annapolis in Congress for the last fourteen years, I join you in remembering Rob, John, Wendi, Rebecca, and Gerald. Together, we can and will carry their legacy forward.
For me, that includes fighting for critical gun safety reforms, because this cycle of violence continues to be repeated over and over again across our country. It also means standing up for journalists who play such a vital role in our daily lives.
To honor the memory of this senseless crime that shocked the Annapolis community, I invite you to support the Capital Gazette Memorial Scholarship Fund, which provides an annual award for journalism students at the University of Maryland, College Park.
In the same way that the surviving members of the Gazette newsroom refused to be silenced — regrouping to publish the paper the very next day after the shooting — so too we must not be silent in our advocacy for gun safety and for freedom of the press.
Please stand with me in support of the Capital Gazette by making a donation to their Memorial Scholarship Fund.

Hello,
I'd like to tell you a story about Jon that you may not know. Nearly three years ago, I began doing some work in the community to stop domestic violence. A woman and her four-year old child had been murdered by her ex-boyfriend, who then killed himself. The case made an imprint on me. A mother and her child were dead. There was a vigil and some media coverage of the deaths, but nobody seemed to be asking many questions.
I had been prosecuting domestic violence cases for about four years at that time and believed more could be done in the community to stop interpersonal violence. I began meeting with experts in the field in Kalamazoo and throughout Michigan, learning about the role that trauma, and witnessing or experiencing violence as a child has on people who go on to become abusive themselves. I learned that suffering trauma is the leading indicator that a person will hurt someone else.
First, we wrestled with the question of which action or set of actions to take to create real change in the community. We knew that trauma contributed significantly to interpersonal violence in the community, but we weren't sure how to address it. After much discussion, the answer came in the form of a new treatment court - a court that treated trauma as a root cause of crime and family violence. Just as Drug Courts treat addiction to reduce crime and recidivism, this court program would treat trauma to reduce violence perpetration. The concept became known as the Kalamazoo County Trauma & Resiliency Court, a first of its kind endeavor in our country.
Next, we were faced with the question of where to turn to provide funding for trauma survivors and their families. Treatment for trauma survivors would help reduce interpersonal violence in the community, but as we all know, treatment costs money. And trauma survivors often lack the resources to pay for quality treatment out of pocket. Particularly, the kind of treatment that effectively calms trauma reactivity and heals families in the process.
Jon Hoadley answered the call. I met with Jon to discuss our efforts and he immediately offered to help. He fought for, and won, funding in the state legislature to create the new treatment court program in Kalamazoo County.
The Trauma & Resiliency Court program will fundamentally change the way we understand and treat trauma survivors in the community, offering survivors help and healing, instead of more pain and punishment. It will mean fewer trauma victims and more resilience in and through the justice system.
I want you to know the critical role Jon played in helping trauma survivors in this community. Nobody has ever done anything like this anywhere in the country or, so far as I know, the world. Unfortunately, the voices of trauma survivors are often ignored in the criminal justice system, as this survivor details in this piece. They repeatedly ask for more resources to treat and heal trauma, but are instead given pain and punishment. Jon is helping to end this injustice in Kalamazoo and bend the arc just a little more.
This is yet one more reason to support Jon Hoadley with your time and money. Jon is doing more for trauma survivors in this community than Upton ever has or ever will. He is quietly, but fundamentally, changing the way we view and treat survivors in the justice system.
I hope you’ll join me in supporting Jon’s campaign.
In politics these days, we too often see the mean and the ugly, the distortion of truth, hurtful words and misdeeds that have come to define the Trump era. Upton, through the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), benefits from this kind of politics.
Jon is different. Jon cares about people. Jon cares about this community. He's fighting for Kalamazoo in Lansing each and every day, and will do the same in Washington, D.C. when we send him to Congress this November. Let's help him get there.
I know this was a long email. If you've gotten to this line, thank you. Let's give Jon the best thanks we can in the coming weeks by voting to retire Upton.
Sincerely yours,
Joe

# Nicole Galloway for Missouri
Happy Pride!
With the ongoing public health emergency, things might be a little different this Pride Month — but as we recognize the contributions and rich history of the LGBTQ+ community in our state and our nation largely from home this year, I wanted to also recognize a stark truth about our state and our country.
Since the Stonewall Riots of 1969 and the first Christopher Street Liberation Day of 1970, we have made historic and significant progress after half a century of Pride. But we still have so far to go — and that’s especially true here in Missouri.
In our state, LGBTQ+ Missourians are still fired, denied housing, denied services, and denied public accommodations because of who they are. For 22 years in a row, the politicians in Jefferson City have refused to move forward the Missouri Non-Discrimination Act (MONA), which would bring protect LGBTQ+ Missourians from this discrimination.
LGBTQ+ Missourians, particularly trans* women of color, continue to face disproportionately high levels of violence and hate crimes. And our youth still face the threats of false, abusive practices like “conversion therapy” without protection.
And across Missouri, we fall behind in providing the access to healthcare, equitable economic opportunity, education resources, and even the basic public safety in our schools each of our communities requires to thrive.
So much more must be done.
To LGBTQ+ Missourians and allies reading this, I want to say this directly to you: as Governor, I will fight for you. I will work for and demand progress — from finally passing MONA to beyond.
And this Pride Month, I hope everyone reading will join me in committing to this fight.
You can make a difference,
Nicole Galloway

# Nicole Galloway for Missouri
Hey team,
Governor Parson finally realized that we need action on the heartbreaking violence plaguing our communities. He’s called for a special legislative session, but he’s failed to recognize the role that gun safety has on this issue.
Missouri has one of the highest rates of gun deaths per year and some of the weakest gun laws in the country. We cannot afford to have these facts continue to be ignored by politicians in our state.
We need REAL action to deal with the devastating gun violence in our state. That’s why today, we’re asking you to please sign our petition demanding common-sense gun safety measures from our leaders in Jefferson City.
SIGN THE PETITION
Last year, when Missourians pleaded with the Governor for a response to children being murdered by gunfire, he said he had to “stay in his lane” — he later called a special session about tax breaks for used cars and yachts instead. And just as he’s finally called for a special session, he’s also continuing to celebrate and parade his A+ rating from the NRA.
Nicole Galloway knows we need real action to confront this epidemic of gun violence. We need common-sense gun safety laws like universal background checks and permits, and we need to let local communities adopt gun safety and anti-crime measures when leaders in Jefferson City fail to act.
It’s well past time that Governor Parson and Missouri politicians got serious about gun violence in Missouri. If you agree, add your name to our call for our leaders to take real action against gun violence right now >>
SIGN THE PETITION
Thanks for making a difference,
Team Galloway

680,"Are you and I ""pro-crime?"" Let me explain what Parson's PAC is saying in a new wave of attacks filled with shocking and obvious lies.
# Nicole Galloway for Missouri
Earlier today, Parson's PAC launched a new wave of attacks filled with shocking and obvious lies, like accusing me and supporters like you of being ""pro-crime.""
I won't dignify these offensive and false attacks with a response. But I will tell you what it says about this race: The status quo is running scared.
In a moment, I'll ask you for your help to fight back — but first, let me explain.
On Governor Parson's watch, everyday families have struggled with rising healthcare costs, underfunded schools and fewer opportunities — all while insiders and mega-donors have been raking in favors and kickbacks. When I'm governor, that all comes to an end — and the folks in power know it.
When we launched this campaign, early polls had us down against Parson by double digits. Now more than a year, multiple fundraising records, and millions of calls and texts later, our grassroots movement has made Missouri a battleground state. The billionaires and special interests are spinning up outrageous lies every week because they're panicking — as they should be.
As Auditor, I've been the taxpayers’ independent watchdog. I've uncovered more than $370 million in wasted or stolen taxpayer money and brought more than 60 criminal counts against corrupt public officials from both political parties. When I say I'll end their culture of corruption, they know it's no BS — that's why I'm running to defeat Mike Parson, and it's why I'm asking for your support today:
Will you add a donation of $5 or whatever you can to my campaign so we can set the record straight for undecided voters before Election Day? We can’t settle for a bought-and-paid-for system any longer — not during this pandemic and not for what comes next — so your donation right now is critical.
Thanks for making a difference when it matters most,
Nicole

690,"The vote this past week was the first entirely partisan vote for impeachment in our country’s history.
Dear Friend,
The vote this past week was the first entirely partisan vote for impeachment in our country’s history, representing a high-water mark of partisan politics and a new low for the standard of impeachment of a sitting president.
There have been no high crimes or misdemeanors, simply an impeachment rooted in hearsay, assumptions, and lies.
What we witnessed since even before President Trump took office is a predetermined agenda of impeachment to fulfill campaign promises made by the socialist Majority in control of half of Congress.
They don’t like him or his policies - the same policies which have led to record economic growth - so they decided to impeach and overturn the will of 63 million Americans.
As for me, I will stand by the truth and the facts and continue to fight for our President every day, just as he fights for all of us.
Sincerely,
JS
I Stand With President Trump

Alex, you know that Don fought back against this partisan scam. He believed that President Trump did not commit any impeachable crimes and fought to expose the truth behind the radical Democrats’ lies.
You know what Don thinks, but after all this, he wants to know, how do you feel about how the Democrats handled the impeachment process?>>>

693,"Hello --
I need you to make me a promise. I need you to promise to vote this November, friends.
Because if you want police officers held accountable for crimes they commit, then you need to vote and elect prosecutors who will do so.
If you want new training practices and stronger thresholds for use-of-force, then you need to vote for officials who will make these changes and ensure real accountability.
And if you want leaders in Washington who have morals, the courage to lead with compassion, and practice love for all people -- then you must vote this November.
Do not stop demanding change, do not slow down, and do not forget to vote this November. I promise to vote for change, and I hope you will, too.
I Promise
In 2018, we ran a campaign driven by love and compassion for one another and took back our voice in Congress. Voters went to the polls in historic numbers and did what many considered impossible by flipping a red, rural district blue.
The power of our vote can reform our broken criminal system, make leaders who use violence against peaceful protestors cower, and make the dismantling of systemic racism possible. But only if we continue to speak truth and vote our conscience.
That's why I'm asking you to please promise to vote this November. Cast your ballot with love in your heart and progress on your mind. If you do, a change will come.
I Promise
With love,
Antonio

As published in the New York Times:
Staring Down Impeachment Vote, Freshman Democrat Seeks Legislative Victories
As Representative Antonio Delgado, a moderate New York Democrat, eyes a politically risky impeachment vote, he is toiling to keep his focus on legislative business and district work.
RHINEBECK, N.Y. — On a recent Friday, as impeachment investigators were releasing new evidence of President Trump’s pressure campaign on Ukraine and John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, was refusing through his lawyer to tell Congress what he knew about ""many relevant meetings and conversations"" in the matter, Representative Antonio Delgado’s mind was elsewhere.
Driving through his Hudson Valley district under a light snow, Mr. Delgado, a first-term Democrat, was preoccupied with legislation he was pursuing, toxic chemical cleanup provisions he was fighting to include in a must-pass defense bill, the farmers he was scheduled to meet and his push to hold 33 town hall-style meetings by the end of December.
Before the sun set at 4:45 p.m., Mr. Delgado would trek 175 miles across the district, scarfing down a breakfast of fluffy pancakes with his wife and twin sons early in the morning so he could attend a school assembly, then making last-minute edits to a speech in the car in between events. It barely left time to brush up on the latest news in the impeachment inquiry consuming Washington.
With five legislative days remaining before Congress leaves for its holiday break, the House is charging toward a party-line vote on impeachment articles against Mr. Trump that will make him only the third president to be impeached. The vote is a politically risky one for freshman lawmakers like Mr. Delgado who won by narrow margins in districts that supported Mr. Trump in 2016, and one that the president and his political allies have argued will cost them their seats.
A spotlight on the people reshaping our politics. A conversation with voters across the country. And a guiding hand through the endless news cycle, telling you what you really need to know.
Mr. Delgado has signaled that he is willing to face the consequences. While he has not announced formally that he will support the articles of impeachment when they come to a vote next week, likely on Wednesday, he said in September that the president’s pressure campaign against Ukraine ""by itself, is an impeachable offense"" and concluded that articles were warranted.
That has made it all the more important for Mr. Delgado and Democrats like him to find ways to show voters they are getting things done in Congress, which is why he is crisscrossing his district through flurries, working on local issues and connecting with constituents.
""You feel the tempo, you feel the strain of it,"" Mr. Delgado said, describing how he has adapted to the life of a congressman. ""And then you adjust for it.""
Speaker Nancy Pelosi has had members like Mr. Delgado at the top of her mind throughout the inquiry, and it is their concerns that have compelled her to sandwich next week’s impeachment vote in between passage of critical legislation to fund the government and a sweeping revision of the NAFTA trade pact.
Ms. Pelosi knows, as many moderate Democrats do, that the important question is not necessarily how they explain a vote to charge the president with high crimes and misdemeanors, but whether they can show that they are delivering on an agenda of legislative work that affects voters’ everyday lives.
Mr. Delgado has not completely shied away from impeachment. When news broke of Mr. Trump’s phone call with the Ukrainian president that is at the heart of the charges, he announced that Congress should begin drafting impeachment articles, going further than most of his moderate colleagues, who tentatively endorsed investigating the allegations. The House Republican campaign arm, eager to tie Mr. Delgado to the liberal wing of the party, called it a ""political death sentence"" and has repeatedly accused him of ""pandering to his socialist base.""
Impeachment Inquiry Through it all, Mr. Delgado has tried to strike a balance, cultivating relationships with Republicans — with his wife, he was one of only a few House Democrats to show up this week at the White House Congressional Ball, even as the Judiciary Committee was debating the articles of impeachment — while offering unsparing criticism of the president’s conduct.
""There’s an abuse of power,"" Mr. Delgado said after the Ukraine allegations surfaced, speaking to voters in the town of Clinton. ""And the abuse of power, too, layers over that crime in a way that I think really creates a level of urgency.""
But Mr. Delgado would prefer to talk about other things: his work on three committees, the enactment of his bill to ease financial burdens for farmers, and a grueling schedule traveling to all corners of his 8,000 square-mile district.
""It matters a lot to go back home and say I introduced a bill,"" Mr. Delgado, a lawyer, Rhodes Scholar and Harvard Law graduate, said in an interview. ""Even if it’s not law, they know that their congressman is working on an issue they flagged.""
""Do you know how powerful that is?"" he added. ""That democracy is still humming ahead a little bit?""
A black congressman in a district in which voters are more than 80 percent white, Mr. Delgado is an unmistakable presence. At 6 feet 4 inches, Mr. Delgado — a former basketball player and Upstate New York hall of fame inductee — is rarely introduced without some quip about his height. And he is the only African-American who holds one of the 14 districts that flipped from voting for President Barack Obama to backing Mr. Trump in 2016. His victory came after a campaign in which Republicans used decades-old lyrics from his brief tenure as a rap artist to suggest he was misogynistic and anti-American, a line of attack widely denounced as racist.
But since January, Mr. Delgado, who was born just outside the district and moved back to the area after the 2016 election, has also amplified his engagement in one of the most rural counties represented by a Democrat. He has held nearly three dozen town hall-style meetings — three in each of the 11 counties in his district — and made a point of introducing bipartisan legislation with a number of his Republican colleagues. Sometimes, he includes his twins in his trips through the county — including a visit to a local bookstore on a recent Saturday, where he posed with a Muhammad Ali biography and his sons’ book selections. (Mr. Delgado, who considers Mr. Ali a personal hero, frequently wears a wristband that reads, ""Find greatness within."")
His first television ad — believed to be the first from a House Democrat in the 2020 campaign — focused on his litany of events and legislation introduced, even as Republicans sought to tie him to calls for impeachment and more liberal members of the caucus.
""He’s been good to work with,"" said Jake Ashby, a local Republican assemblyman who recently participated in a veterans’ event with Mr. Delgado. Pointing toward some of the bills Mr. Delgado has championed, he added, ""He’s been able to get them through, and that’s been encouraging to see.""
At one October gathering, Asejah Lazerson, from Pleasant Valley, N.Y., came to see Mr. Delgado after she wrote a letter about her challenges finding employment and taking care of her children. Mr. Delgado had followed up with a 30-minute phone call.
""It feels like my voice isn’t being heard, and there’s so much gridlock in Washington, all this bitter fighting and nothing is getting done,"" Ms. Lazerson said in an interview. ""For him to call me and let me know that he heard my letter, and read my letter, and it touched him — it was very reassuring.""
""Every time I tell my story, I don’t know if anybody cares,"" she added, after wiping away tears. Her son ended up writing a report on Mr. Delgado for school.
At a Veterans Day breakfast last month, Walter O’Neil, a Marine veteran, shook Mr. Delgado’s hand and cheerfully informed his congressman, ""I didn’t vote for you.""
""That’s all right,"" Mr. Delgado replied with a smile. ""I’m still serving you."" (In a brief interview afterward, Mr. O’Neil conceded that Mr. Delgado ""is doing a good job."")
But moments later, a couple rushed to Mr. Delgado’s side, professing to be his biggest fans and asking for a picture.
""It was like meeting a rock star,"" said Barbara Holms, 64, who came to the event with her husband, Michael, who served with the Navy during the Vietnam War. ""He doesn’t lip sync. He shows up.""

ASK MOE: POLICE REFORM IS COMING
We receive questions from voters all of the time and do our best to try to answer them. Here’s Moe’s response on policies involving police reform:
> “In the wake of the murder of George Floyd and many others, which have prompted both peaceful protests and violence in the streets across our country in recent weeks, I have been asked about police reform policies I would support.
> First, let me say that I believe this is a historic reckoning for the years and years of racial injustice. How we move forward from this moment will define who we are as a nation. We must be on the right side of history.
> As you may know, I have had many colleagues of color -- as a student at North Carolina Central University, where I earned my law degree, and as a law professor at Howard University. I have stood my whole professional life trying to fight injustice, wherever and however I encountered it. In Congress, I will do the same.
> We must change our culture and we can begin to do so by changing our laws. On the federal level, I support ending qualified immunity so that police officers can be held liable for violating the rights of people they serve. I would also push to establish a federal model policing program, adopting policies from the #8CantWait campaign that create standards of conduct and emphasize de-escalation and the use of non-lethal force. And it is long past time to make lynching a federal hate crime.
> Finally, we need to create a database to track complaints of officer misconduct, officer-involved shootings, use-of-force incidents and misuse of body cams, to begin to bring some accountability to our 18,000 police agencies across the country.
> Some of these policies are part of the House police reform bill – another effort at much needed change. And they are a good start. I look forward to continuing to improve on these when I am in Congress.
> Rest assured, change is coming. Finally.”
We will have more on this in the near future.
PRINCIPAL CHIEF SNEED JOINS MOE TALKS!
We are excited to announce that Richard G. Sneed, Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, will join Moe on Moe Talks on Thursday, July 9 at 7 p.m.
Principal Chief Sneed, a former Marine and longtime teacher, manages day-to-day operations for the 15,000-member EBCI based in the Qualla Boundary in Western North Carolina.
“I have a lot to learn about the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and what a member of Congress can do to be an effective advocate for their interests, so I’m grateful to Principal Chief Sneed for taking time to talk to me,’’ Davis said. “He and I are both military veterans and former educators, so we share a common commitment to our country and our communities.”
SAVING DACA
Imagine growing up in America, working hard to gain an education, earning a job and paying taxes like everyone else. Imagine living that American dream and then being told after doing everything right for years that you will have to move to a country you have never known because you weren't born here.
It's un-American. We are a nation of immigrants and those who were brought here as children and worked to fully contribute to our society have earned their place in it.
So we wholeheartedly support the Supreme Court decision handed down today that President Trump cannot end DACA -- Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals -- that protects these immigrants from deportation.
It is our hope, after the November election and when a new Congress is sworn in, that immigration reform will be a top priority and a path to citizenship is created for DACA recipients.
Once and for all.

Wildfires are a reality for Western North Carolina, as many who were here in 2016 well know. We lost about 62,000 acres during a severe drought that fall.
We need to be better prepared for the next drought. To that end, the McDowell Community Wildfire Network has been created.
According to The McDowell News, “This is a partnership between local agencies including the city of Marion, McDowell County, Marion Fire Department, U.S. Forest Service, N.C. Forest Service, Mountain Valleys Resource Conservation and Development Council, the Nature Conservancy and others.
“The partnership was recently granted $40,000 from the Action, Implementation and Mitigation (AIM) grant program offered by an organization called Coalitions & Collaboratives, Inc. out of Lake George, Colo. This grant will support the partnership with program coordination, tracking mitigation activities, and acquiring mitigation equipment.”
You can read more about the partnership in this link, along with ways you can help prevent wildfires from damaging your home in the future.
Droughts are likely to become more common because of climate change. It is in our best interest in Western North Carolina to elect leaders who will actually listen to scientists and push for green energy and green technology to protect our environment.
We have too much to lose.
A JUNETEENTH TO REMEMBER
Last Friday was Juneteenth, the annual commemoration of the end of slavery in the United States. But this year it felt a little different, didn’t it?
There are still protests and marches in the streets across the U.S. over police violence against people of color. We are 155 years past June 19, 1865, when slavery ended in Texas, and yet there is still a need to speak out and demand equality.
So today, let’s speak out about the monuments across the country that celebrate Confederate war generals and other symbols of division. As petitions are submitted and heated arguments ensue in town halls and city councils everywhere, let’s remember on this Juneteenth what those monuments truly stand for and why they must come down.
The Confederate flag — that whole issue — was a battle to divide the country. It was a group of people that didn’t want United States. They wanted dis-United States. That was treasonous. So to have monuments glorifying this effort to divide the country, particularly knowing the message — what that conveys to a significant segment of the population — there’s just no sense in it.
This is an issue that should have been settled long ago, so it’s one that we need to settle. We ought to be focusing on issues that really matter, like getting healthcare and education. We ought to be focusing on those and not on honoring the past when that past is not something that was honorable.
So we support the efforts to remove the monuments and relocate them to an appropriate place that’s not public property.

Republicans owned social media in 2016 and that helped sweep their party to victory in the November election. We can’t let that happen again.
So we need to ask a favor. Share our posts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram with your friends and family. Share videos of our twice-weekly Moe Talks! Live Virtual Town Halls. Share this newsletter.

APPLY FOR ABSENTEE BALLOT SOON
Given the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic and how it could impact voting in November, we are urging everyone in the 11th District to apply to vote by absentee ballot. You can go to this link for an application. You might want to wait until after Tuesday’s Republican runoff election to submit an application.
Voters have until Oct. 27 to request an absentee ballot, but we would recommend it be submitted well in advance so that the State Board of Elections isn’t inundated at the last minute and there isn’t any delay in getting the ballot back in time.
Reminder, you don’t have to vote by absentee ballot if you apply. But it is a great back-up if there are any disruptions and a reduction in polling locations due to the pandemic. Keep in mind that even if you apply now, you won’t actually receive an absentee ballot until September.
WE’LL KNOW OUR OPPONENT TOMORROW
The Republican runoff between Lynda Bennett and Madison Cawthorn will be held tomorrow, June 23, so we will finally know our opponent in the November election.
Not that it makes a difference. Republicans want to hold onto Mark Meadows’s old seat in Congress, and they have already spent $2 million to try to buy it even though the two candidates have no relevant experience for the job.
Don’t let them get away with it. Please.
We aren’t accepting corporate PAC money, so we need your contributions to fight for this seat.
Help us. Donate here.
Stay home. Stay safe. Stay healthy.

By some estimates, over half the U.S. prison population is comprised of nonviolent drug offenders – disproportionately poor people and people of color, most of whom posed little risk to the community when originally sentenced and certainly pose no threat today.
People in our prisons who can't practice social distancing or protect themselves from the coronavirus, are being infected at extraordinary rates, effectively sentenced to death for minor crimes.
Read my 4/20 op-ed in The Hill calling for an end to the War on Drugs and a new system of support for those who've borne the brunt of that failed policy.
""With prisons serving as COVID-19 hotspots, Congress needs to act to end the failed war on drugs"" -- Earl Blumenauer, Guest opinion, The Hill
As we are dealing with unprecedented upheaval and understanding of the flawed nature of so many policies and practices, the need for cannabis reform and urgent economic stabilization amidst this health crisis is a small but important opportunity to get the policies right, save lives, lower the cost of healthcare, and strike a blow for racial equality and personal freedom.

Donald Trump has always believed he is above the law – even before he was elected. But since Senate Republicans voted to leave him in office despite his crimes, he's pushed his authoritarianism to new heights.
He's punished war heroes who told the truth and followed the law.
He's attacked federal judges by name.
Yesterday, he pressured the Department of Justice to go easy on his friend, convicted criminal Roger Stone. Not long after, his Attorney General Bill Barr (who's never met a Trump order he wouldn't sell our country out for) obeyed, ordering the prosecutors recommend less jail time for Stone.
Disgusted by Trump and Barr's willingness to politicize justice, the entire team of prosecutors has resigned.
None of this happened behind closed doors, Alex. It wasn't subtle. Trump issued his demands on Twitter, for all the world to see. The DOJ has become a political tool for Trump to use as he pleases, and he wants everyone to know it. He's destroying our institutions and our democracy in plain sight.
And Republicans in Congress have the nerve to act surprised that Trump and Barr would abuse their power in this way. More than one has expressed ""concern.""
As if no one saw this coming.
Enough, Alex. This charade has to end. Republicans in Congress have no intention to hold Trump accountable or to set any limits on him. And at this point, none have the courage or the moral standing to even try. That's why I'm going to be campaigning with and fighting for Democrats across the country in 2020.
We've got to hold the House and take back the Senate this year, and we've got to fight with everything we've got. That means all of us. Please chip in $3 now to keep building the movement to end Republican control of our government in 2020.

In December, I voted to impeach Donald Trump because I saw overwhelming evidence of his efforts to obstruct justice and abuse the power of his office.
Then, I was proud to lead the effort to hold onto the Articles of Impeachment and not rush them to the Senate. The time allowed more information to come out.
This strategic move paid off. Since the start of the trial, even more - and more damning - evidence has steadily emerged.
Last week, Lev Parnas, a man at the heart of the impeachment inquiry (and whom Trump claims to not know) said that he was asked directly to sacrifice himself for Trump, and that Trump was unquestionably the driving force in the Ukrainian scandal.
Yesterday, we learned that the not-yet-published memoir of John Bolton,Trump's former National Security Advisor, includes several pages detailing Trump's plan to shake down Ukraine to investigate his political opponents.
There's no end in sight, Alex.
What will we learn tomorrow? Next week?
Each new item uncovered makes it harder for Republicans to justify their denial and rush to judgement. Even so, Mitch McConnell and the Senate GOP are still scrambling to cover up Trump's crimes.
They're seriously making the argument that jurors in one of the most important trials in our nation's history shouldn't hear any evidence.
If this isn't the greatest cover-up by a sitting president our country has ever seen, it's well on its way.
Our way forward? Win in 2020. Keep the House. Take back the Senate. Defeat Trump. Win back our country.
I plan to spend a lot of 2020 making sure they don't get a free pass. But I can't do it alone.
It's going to take all of us working together to restore the promise of government by the people, for the people. Our movement has to stretch from coast-to-coast, from Oregon outward. We built up some serious momentum in 2018. Now, we have to not just sustain it, but keep building it, all the way to November 3 – and beyond.
Donate today and let's take back our government.

Earl

Last week, my fellow Democrats and I laid out a way forward for post-Trump America.
We talked about values: compassion, democracy, justice.
We talked about action: universal health care, a Green New Deal, gun safety reform.
And we talked about bringing the reality of this country closer to our ideals, making government work for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-connected.
That means our movement needs to not only take back the White House and the Senate, but to protect and strengthen our majority in the House, Alex. Contribute now to make sure we've got what we need to win those fights!
This week, it's the Republicans' turn.
They're talking about one thing, and one thing only: fear.
On Monday night, we listened to one speaker after another work themselves into a frenzy, describing our movement as a ""vengeful mob that seeks to destroy our way of life, our neighborhoods, schools, churches, and values"" that will ""bring crime, lawlessness, and low-quality apartments into thriving suburban neighborhoods.""
That's not vision, Alex. It's a cynical, divisive, fear-mongering rant.
Yesterday, they doubled down, attacking the LGBTQ+ community, diplomacy, and truth itself.
We're not interested in hearing what they say tonight. The Trump era has written enough horror stories. It's time to close the book on them and build the progressive future our country needs.
Are you with me? Chip in $3 now and let's keep building this movement!

Last night, the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to impeach President Donald Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors against the Constitution and our democracy.
But Senator Mitch McConnell says he is ""not impartial"" and ""working in lockstep"" with the President's team.
That is not acceptable.
That is why I led the call to hold back the impeachment referral until Sen. McConnell agrees to adhere to the rules – and to do his job – by allowing a fair trial that upholds the Constitution. I am grateful to Speaker Pelosi and my House colleagues for taking up that call and holding the line on this battle for our democracy.
Add your name to tell Mitch McConnell: ""No kangaroo court for impeachment. Americans demand a fair trial.""
It's time for Senate Republicans to stop playing politics and uphold their oaths of office. It's time for Donald Trump to be held accountable.

Friend,
As a Navy SEAL who deployed five times to fight for our country, I am dedicated to keeping the American people safe. I’m continuing that fight now in Congress.
But radical Democrats are threatening the security of our country, advocating for open borders and defunding the police. Americans must wake up to the reality of far-left extremists winning in November: the safety of our communities is at stake.
That’s why we need to elect leaders who will fight for border security and support our law enforcement officers.
Border security is critical to national security. But right now, the radical-left is trying to undermine our border security, advocating for open borders, a return to catch-and-release policies and sanctuary cities.
Meanwhile, we are witnessing in real time the effects of Democrat governance. Radical calls to defund the police and constant demonization of law enforcement have resulted in a rise in crime that is tearing our communities apart.
Enough is enough.
It’s time we put the safety of our nation first. That’s exactly what my friend and colleague, Brian Fitzpatrick, is fighting for in Congress.
As a former FBI Agent, Brian knows how to keep the American people safe from all enemies, both foreign and domestic.
He is fighting to secure our borders, support our police officers, and keep our communities safe.
Brian stands for strong border security, including physical barriers and increasing manpower to go against not just drugs and guns from cartels, but also criminals and terrorists. And as a former FBI agent, Brian supports giving our law enforcement officers the resources they need to keep the peace and maintain law and order, and is fighting back against radical efforts to dismantle police departments.
And that’s why I stand with Brian.
We need his leadership in Congress as we fight to secure our border and keep our families safe.
Stand with me and support Brian’s campaign and tell the country we want a safe country.
This issue is too important to ignore.
We need action NOW
Thank you,
Dan Crenshaw

Friend,
Our country is facing a crossroads. The far-left extremists are calling to defund the police at a time when they need us most. The far-left simply does not understand.
They are threatening our law enforcement heroes in Bucks and Montgomery Counties and across our nation who protect us and keep us safe.
Defunding our police isn’t the answer.
Our communities need the police, they should be fully funded, and they deserve our utmost respect. This is why Brian has been working on bipartisan legislation to support our men and women in law enforcement, who put their lives on the line on a daily basis.
Stand with Brian and support our police!
Our community doesn’t want the far-left extremist “defund the police” policy, which would leave our communities open to a drastic increase in crime.
This just isn’t acceptable.
Sign our petition today to stand with Brian and say NO to defunding the police!

Carolyn Maloney for Congress
Friends,
Pride Month this year came with a landmark victory when the Supreme Court ruled to bar employer discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals a few weeks ago. But in this month of celebration and appreciation for the LGBTQ+ community, we've also seen that there is still so much work to be done in the fight for equality.
The FDA continues to hold discriminatory blanket deferrals on blood donations. Anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes have persisted, particularly on transwomen of color. And on the 4 year anniversary of the Orlando Pulse Nightclub shooting, the president moved to allow healthcare providers to deny treatment to transgender patients.
Pride Month may be over, but the fight for LGBTQ+ equality is not.
I will continue to fight for protections for the LGBTQ+ community — not only in the workplace and healthcare but in all parts of American society until we have guaranteed that basic civil rights are not determined by sexual orientation or gender identity.
Today, I'm asking for your support in urging the Senate to pass The Equality Act — so that LGBTQ+ protections are universal and these individuals are guaranteed the human rights, dignity, and respect they deserve. ADD YOUR NAME NOW TO BECOME A CITIZEN CO-SPONSOR >>
Pride Equality Act Button
The Equality Act would expand nondiscrimination protections to healthcare, housing, credit, education, public spaces and services, and more. It is critical that we wholeheartedly support this effort to ensure the equality for the LGBTQ+ community that we’ve fought so long for.
The LGBTQ+ community will remain vulnerable to discrimination until we take legislative action to counter attacks from Trump and far-right challengers.

TRUMP PENCE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
BREAKING: Joe Biden picks PHONY Kamala Harris as running mate.
Alex,
Wow.
Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn't get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?).
Next, she ends her pathetic run at President.
Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP.
And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it's obvious that this radical duo is PERFECT for each other but WRONG for America.
They are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working tirelessly to restore LAW AND ORDER.
It's going to be up to Patriots like YOU to save our Nation from that dark fate, Alex. Election Day is right around the corner, and now that we know what we're up against, I'm going to do something HUGE:

TRUMP PENCE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Alex,
It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
For the sake of American strength, jobs, law and order, our lives, and our liberties, we must defeat this radical duo on Election Day. The stakes have never been higher, and we need your help to send a message that this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS.
For the NEXT HOUR, all contributions will be 600%-MATCHED!

Electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November would be a grave mistake for this Nation with irreversible consequences. They will raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators.
We cannot allow our Nation to go down that path, Alex.
President Trump and I are counting on our BEST supporters right now. Can we count on YOU to step up during this critical time?

Abigail Spanberger to vote to Impeach President Trump
This is ridiculous! After months of testimony, evidence, and witnesses, it’s clear that President Trump did not commit ANY crimes. Abigail Spanberger hates President Trump so much that she’s willing to do anything it takes to undo the 2016 Presidential election.
We deserve someone in Congress who doesn’t play political games just to score points from her donors. We deserve someone who is going to fight back against the Democrat’s radical agenda. We need Nick Freitas in Congress.

Today Senate Republicans voted to ACQUIT PRESIDENT TRUMP OF ALL IMPEACHMENT CHARGES!
This is great news after the countless impeachment conspiracy theories perpetuated by Adam Schiff and the impeachment-crazed Democrats. Now after MONTHS of witnesses, testimony, and transcripts we get the truth -- President Trump didn’t commit ANY crimes.

Four years ago, Wisconsin gambled on Donald [[URL REDACTED]] and we lost.
Bad numbers
Boy was that a bust! But even as the odds of a second Trump term continue to dwindle, a new Supreme Court decision to throw out mail ballots in Wisconsin that are postmarked by Election Day but arrive after November 3rd, makes it clear that although a Joe Biden victory is not guaranteed, collusion and cheating by Donald Trump, his Republican lapdogs, and now the illegitimate US Supreme Court, is. Will you help me stop it by helping me GET OUT THE VOTE IN WISCONSIN?
Contribute
We cannot place the same bet again.
A vote for Trump is a lot like playing the lottery. Your odds of winning are low, but your odds of losing are high. Play Trump’s numbers and see where that gets us:
226,000 \- The amount of Americans dead so far due to COVID-19
26 -The amount of women who have accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct
5,500 -The number of children separated from their parents at the US/Mexican border
7.9% \- The US jobless rate in September
8 \- The number of Trump associates arrested or convicted of crimes
$750 \- The amount of taxes Trump paid in 2016 and 2017
Donald Trump has gambled away people’s lives and livelihoods to enrich himself and to serve his personal and financial interests his entire life. And he’s played with house money to do so.
In a few days, we have a chance to reshuffle the deck and deal ourselves a winning hand with a Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ticket. But it doesn’t just stop at the Presidential race. To #WINsconsin, we have to max bet on BLUE and vote for every Democrat in every race, everywhere.

Alex,
This year has shown Michiganders what our priorities are. Our family, our freedom, and our financial security have become more precious to us than ever. They have also been threatened like never before.
Before you vote this November, ask yourself who you trust on these four fundamental issues:
* Who do you trust with your job security and getting the economy back on track?
* Who do you trust to fight for the safety and security of your families?
* Who do you trust to uphold First Amendment rights to free speech and free expression for ALL Americans?
* Who do you trust to love this nation and fix it—rather than dismantle and destroy it?
That is what’s at stake this November.
We’ve seen the Democratic vision for America these past months. Violent crime running rampant, Americans silenced by censorship and economic devastation across the country. We cannot let that be our future. We cannot give the mob a mandate this November.
TAKE ACTION
We will recover from this as a stronger nation, but we need Republican leadership to make that possible.
We want to make sure that hardworking small business owners have a future and their boarded-up businesses can re-open and prosper.
Higher taxes and burdensome regulations proposed by the Democrats will crush resilient Michiganders and the future of our country.
As your Representatives, we know that Republicans win on the economy every time. We win on keeping your families safe, championing free speech, and leaving your money where it belongs: your pocket.
CHOOSE AMERICAN PROSPERITY
We believe that this American comeback will make us stronger than ever. We want to lead a Michigan where ALL people can enjoy the prosperity of the American Dream.
Help us win in November!
We’re Fighting For You,
Michigan Republican Congressional Delegation

Alex,
I am deeply saddened by the horrible “Defund the Police” movement that has taken over some parts of our country.
Our brave men and women in uniform deserve respect and appreciation for risking their lives every day to keep us and our communities safe.
STOP THE DEFUND THE POLICE MOVEMENT
DEFEND THE POLICE
Our police officers are good people, they work hard to make us all feel safe, and it is not right to drag them through the mud for the horrid actions of a few.
Unfortunately, this year, the crime rate has spiked and police suicides are increasing, while recent violence across the nation, including Portland and Chicago, shows why we need to appreciate the hard work of the men and women who protect us from lawlessness.
We must DEFEND our police and thank them - not get RID of them!
STAND WITH THE THIN BLUE LINE
We must stand together as one people, united, against violence and anarchy. Our officers need our support. Will you help me show our Thin Blue Line that we stand with them and oppose defunding the Police?
SHOW YOUR SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT
Thank you,

SUPREME COURT RULING: Donald J. Trump Must Release His Tax Returns

It’s happening.
The Supreme Court ruled Donald Trump MUST hand over his taxes. Once his crimes are exposed, Trump will LOSE his bid for the White House!!
So Trump’s corrupt lawyers are fighting to tooth and nail to COVER-UP his tax returns.
They’re ignoring the Supreme Court. It’s OUTRIGHT corruption!!
If we collect 100,000 signatures DEMANDING Trump’s tax returns → we can expose Trump for the FRAUD and LIAR that he is!

Folks, while I was serving as Vice President, I wrote this letter to my 12-year-old self. Given the tough times folks are going through right now, I hope this message of perseverance is meaningful to you. Together, we will overcome this crisis. And then, with your help, we will win the most important election of our lifetimes. If you’re in a position to contribute today, I would greatly appreciate a grassroots contribution of $5 to help our team continue the fight.
* * *
Dear Joe,
You’re only twelve. Your stutter is debilitating. It embarrasses you, and the bullies are vicious.
But listen to Mom when she says, “bravery resides in every heart” — and yours is fierce and clear. Listen to Dad when he says, “we get knocked down, and then we get right back up.”
Because if you listen, you’ll summon the bravery to overcome the stutter and stand up to the bullies.
You’ll learn from Dad who moved the family to look for work — that a job is a lot more than a paycheck; it’s about dignity and respect.
You’ll learn from him that the cardinal sin is the abuse of power — and you have an obligation to fight the abuse whenever you see it.
And that’s why you’ll follow your heart to serve your community, state, and your country.
An intolerance for the abuse of power will drive you to stand up for civil rights, end the scourge of violence against women, confront corporations polluting the environment, and fight crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing around the world.
And because you listened, you’ll live a life fully consistent with what you were taught by Mom and Dad and your faith.
That you should say what you mean and mean what you say.
That we cannot serve ourselves at the expense of others.
Leading by the power of example will define you, and one day, find yourself forging a relationship with a Jesuit Pope who embodies that universal truth.
But you’ll also learn early — and later — in life that reality has a way of intruding.
One day you’re on top of the world, only to be brought down in a flash with a profound loss and grief that leaves a black hole in your heart, questions of faith in your soul, and an anger beyond rage.
That’s when you’ll have to dig deep and live what Mom taught you — that out of everything terrible that happens, something good will come if you look hard enough.
You’ll hold on with faith and pure grit.
You’ll be blessed with a love that will anchor you as deeply as your faith.
Your bond with your children and grandchildren will be your redemption.
Your ties with your sister and brothers will hold you tighter together.
Because of a family grounded in unconditional love and loyalty, and the compassion of friends and strangers, you’ll not only get help.
You’ll get up. You’ll keep going. You’ll give back in kind.
You’ll realize that countless people have suffered equally or more, but with much less support and much less reason to want to get through it.
But they too get up. They too keep going. As you will.
You’ll learn what it means to be an American. There’s no quit in America.
You’ll learn that happiness and success in life is an accumulation of a thousand little things built on the character of who we are as Americans.
A country where no one is better than you, and everyone is your equal — regardless of who they are, what they do, where they come from, or who they love.
You’ll learn that it’s about being personal. Being there for family and friends. Serving your country.
Building real relationships, even with people with whom you vehemently disagree.
That’s America — made up of ordinary people, like you, doing extraordinary things.
And one day when you graduate from law school, you’ll decide to become a public defender.
In the midst of the epic struggle for civil rights, you’ll be walking the streets on the east side of Wilmington, much of which has been burned to the ground after your heroes were assassinated.
Forty years later, you’ll stand on a train platform overlooking the east side. Wilmington and the nation are no longer aflame, but awaiting a new ripple of hope.
You’ll be waiting for a young black man, inspired by the dream of a King, coming from Philadelphia to pick you up and take you on a 124-mile trip to Washington to be sworn in as President and Vice President of the United States.
Together, you’ll prove that change is hard but necessary; progress is never easy but always possible; and things do get better on our march toward that more perfect union.
That’s the history of the journey of America.
And believe it or not, because you listened to Mom and Dad, you’ll help write it.
Keep the faith, Joey.
Thanks for reading this letter all the way to the end. It's a powerful reminder that as Americans, there is nothing that we cannot overcome, especially when we stand together.
We hope you feel like you know Joe Biden a little bit better today.

BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT NEWSLETTER
Below is Joe Biden’s newsletter for August 23, 2020. Please submit questions and feedback here.
Folks,
What an incredible August it has been for this campaign.
I announced Kamala Harris as my running mate, we held a one-of-a-kind Democratic National Convention all across America, and on Thursday I accepted your nomination for President of the United States.
The last few weeks have been inspiring and humbling. Getting to hear from people across the country -- friends, family, and so many other folks -- about why they’re supporting me and this campaign for the presidency is something I’ll never forget.
I’ll be frank with you: these next 72 days won’t be easy. But when I need strength, I’ll think back to this week. And I hope you will too.
I’m excited to share in this newsletter all of what the campaign has been doing in August, but for now, I’ll leave you with a line I quoted in my convention speech on Thursday from Ella Baker, a giant of the civil rights movement:
“Give people light and they will find a way.”
I give you my word: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. I will be an ally of the light, not of the darkness.
Now is the time for us to come together, to choose hope over fear, to give people the light.
Let's get to work.
Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Kamala Harris, Doug Emhoff
Campaign Updates
I couldn’t possibly sum up everything that was said over the four days of the Democratic National Convention and everything else this campaign has been up to without making this email too long, so I’m excited to share just a few highlights with you.
But first -- if these moments moved you as much as they moved me, can you make your first donation to keep up this campaign’s momentum after an electric week?

When I first met Brayden on the campaign trail, I saw a familiar anxiety on his face. It was the anxiety of a kid with a stutter, something I struggled to overcome when I was a kid, too. I told him then that we can’t let the barriers in our life define us, and he took that message to heart. I’m proud to be a part of his story, and of the courage this remarkable young man had to share his story with the world on the last night of the convention. Click below to watch his speech:
Watch Brayden's speech
Having my friend Jacquelyn nominate me for President of the United States meant the world to me. I’m so glad we got to share that elevator ride together, and that you were brave enough to say you supported me when so many were ready to count this campaign out. Jacquelyn, I hope you know -- we love you back.
Watch Jacquelyn nominate Joe Biden for President
And this campaign has been doing even more than just holding a historic convention.
Earlier this month, I announced my Agenda for the Latino Community. As president, I’ll invest in Latinos’ economic mobility, make far-reaching investments in ending health disparities by race, expand access to high-quality education, and tackle racial inequity in our education system. I’ll combat hate crimes and gun violence, and secure our values as a nation of immigrants. You can read my full plan by clicking on the images below:

And we made history in another way this month -- with the largest ad buy ever made by a general election presidential candidate. My team is planning to spend $280 million to advertise in battleground states online, on TV, and anywhere else we can reach voters.
But here’s the truth: we still have to keep fundraising to make sure we can afford to run these ads and fund our critical organizing work.
That’s why I have to ask: can you make your first donation to power our campaign to victory in November?

What’s Coming
Starting tomorrow, Donald Trump will hold the Republican National Convention. If I’m being honest, I hope you won’t spend too much time watching it -- their week is sure to be dark and divisive, and there is so much organizing work to be done on our end instead.
So here’s my ask: Will you do one extra thing this week to make sure Democrats up and down the ballot win in November? Whether it’s talking with friends and family, making calls with my campaign, or making your plan to vote, everything you do today counts. Here’s one of my favorite options:
Text Vote to 30330
We only have 72 days left in this election, and every single one of those days matters.
My campaign is hosting virtual events, running our advertising programs, and implementing massive organizing plans across the country. And I’m so glad you’re a part of it.
But running such an ambitious, historic campaign means we also have to set ambitious, historic fundraising goals. And since this is a grassroots campaign, we rely on supporters like you to reach them. That’s why I’m asking, one more time:
Will you chip in right now to power my campaign? Any amount you’re able to give will make a real difference.
If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

I could keep reminiscing about these past few weeks for a lot longer, but that won’t help us win votes in November, so it’s time for me to wrap up.
But I hope you feel as energized and hopeful as I do right now -- for this campaign, and for our country’s future.
This is our moment to decide who we are as Americans. And I know that with you by my side, we can win this battle for the soul of the nation.
So for now -- keep the faith, and keep up the fight. We can do this.
\- Joe

Business Insider explains it best: (we’ve included the most important parts)
Business Insider: Trump reportedly rejected approving a bailout package that would rescue the US Postal Service, and it could be a disaster for states trying to expand voting by mail
The United States has plunged the US Postal Service into dire financial straits, as more Americans than ever rely on post offices to deliver necessary medicine and supplies, especially in underserved rural areas.
House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Gerry Conolly, who runs the subcommittee that oversees the Postal Service, sounded the alarm that the agency could run out of funding altogether by June if Congress doesn't act soon.
""Based on a number of briefings and warnings this week about a critical fall-off in mail across the country, it has become clear that the Postal Service will not survive the summer without immediate help from Congress and the White House,"" the two said in a March 23 joint statement, calling on Congress to appropriate $25 million in emergency funds to the agency.

As states have steadily expanded absentee and mail-in voting over the past two decades, the proportion of Americans voting in-person on election day has declined from 90% in 1992 to 60% in 2016, according to the US Census Bureau.
But some Republicans have openly protested expanding vote by mail options because they believe it would hurt them politically. Trump said in a recent ""Fox & Friends"" appearance that the House's stimulus provisions had ""levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.""
Since then, Trump has continued to spread misinformation about the safety and security of voting by mail on his Twitter account, falsely claiming that it ""substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD,"" which none of the available evidence on vote by mail supports.

The U.S. Postal Service is a critical and beloved institution.
And their role in delivering millions of mail-in ballots this November will prove to be critical to the 2020 Election.
But Republicans are terrified by the prospect of increased voter turnout ‑‑ so they’re determined to run the U.S. Post Office into the ground!
We CANNOT let that happen.

Republican officials tested their November voter suppression strategy on our primary a few weeks ago.
We all saw what happened -- six-hour lines, broken voting machines, and missing absentee ballots.

And with not one, but two Senate seats up for grabs in Georgia this year, control of the Senate Majority will be decided here!

I've dedicated my career to exposing corruption, the abuse of power, and organized crime.
Now, at a moment when political corruption is destroying our democracy, I'm taking that fight to the Senate.
My GOP opponent was too busy trading medical and vaccine stocks to prepare our state for this pandemic.
Senator David Perdue is corrupt, and a Trump puppet.
He doesn’t represent my state’s values.
We need a SURGE of grassroots support to replace him in November.
Here’s the bottom line: If we fail to hit our fundraising goal this month, we'll be off track for the rest of the campaign and risk control of the Senate.
My lead in the polls could crumble!

JUSTICE FOR BREONNA TAYLOR: DEMAND THE INVADING OFFICERS ARE CHARGED WITH MURDER ➞
We need you to remember this name: Breonna Taylor.
Breonna Taylor was an award-winning EMT and First Responder from Louisville, KY who risked her own health and safety to serve her community during Covid-19. Her life mattered.
Breonna Taylor
But Breonna was murdered by the Louisville Police Department at her home while sleeping. They barged in without identifying themselves to look for drugs that were never found and for a person who did not even reside in Breonna’s residence.
Breonna’s life was stolen. But the three police officers who invaded her home are STILL gainfully employed and have yet to be arrested and charged with murder.
The only person who was charged was Breonna’s boyfriend, who shot at the door in self-defense when the officers refused to identify themselves.
We’re beyond disgusted at this horrific disregard for Black life. So we’re calling for justice.
We won’t rest until these offenders are held accountable for their crime. Sign on to demand the invading officers are charged with the murder of Breonna Taylor →
JUSTICE FOR BREONNA TAYLOR: DEMAND THE INVADING OFFICERS ARE CHARGED WITH MURDER ➞
Black Americans, especially Black essential workers like Breonna, deserve the right to sleep peacefully in their own home, free from harm.
This is an injustice that cannot be ignored. And it will take an army of grassroots activists like you, to finally be taken seriously by Kentucky State Officials.

Donald Trump
At the RNC, Trump said he's ""done more in three years for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years.""
Let’s check the facts:
\-- He called African nations “sh*thole countries”
\-- He’s told Black Congresswomen to “go back to the crime-infested places of which they came”
\-- And he won’t do ANYTHING to stop police brutality.
So we need EVERY good Democrat to join our fight to END Trump’s racist attacks. We're $27,094 short of our goal to fuel this fight. Donate $5 to stop Trump’s racist attacks now >>
For decades, Black Americans have risked everything to fight for equality.
That fight is FAR from over.
Police are still taking innocent Black lives.
And Trump won’t do anything to help. He’ll just spew racist lies.
The President will not do the right thing unless will force him. We need $45,000 to fund our campaigns. Every dollar will go to electing Black Democrats who will stand up to Trump’s racism.
But if we miss this goal, Trump will continue to ignore us.
So please, don’t wait another minute. Rush $5 to end Trump’s racist and bigoted attacks on Black Americans >>

Trump
YES >>
NO >>
UNSURE >>
PLEASE BE HONEST. OFFICIAL POLL CONDUCTED 09/20/2020, COLLECTING RESPONSES UNTIL 11:59PM.
Trump escaped impeachment simply because the GOP saved his hide.
But in the impeachment trial, we saw hard evidence that Trump obstructed justice.
So Kamala Harris, speaking as a former prosecutor, is simply trying to uphold the law. Trump is not above the law and he must be held accountable.
But charging an ex-President (even one as CORRUPT and CRIMINAL as Trump) is controversial, so we need to gauge support among informed Democrats.
The Department of Justice will NEVER act unless we show public support, so we need your response immediately >>

This is so wrong! That’s why Kamala Harris is fighting back:
""It is a federal crime to interfere with people's right to vote. You may want to talk to your lawyer about that."" -Kamala Harris
Kamala Harris is right: Trump’s interference is ILLEGAL. We MUST respond!
Stand with Kamala Harris to DEMAND that EVERY ballot is counted.

BREAKING: Kamala Harris says her administration would bring CRIMINAL CHARGES against Trump.
NPR: Kamala Harris says her administration would have no choice but to charge Trump with crimes.
SHOULD TRUMP BE PROSECUTED FOR HIS CRIMES WHEN HE LEAVES OFFICE?
Trump
YES >>
NO >>
UNSURE >>
PLEASE BE HONEST. OFFICIAL POLL CONDUCTED 09/06/2020, COLLECTING RESPONSES UNTIL 11:59PM.
Trump escaped impeachment simply because the GOP saved his hide.
But in the impeachment trial, we saw hard evidence that Trump obstructed justice.
So Kamala Harris, speaking as a former prosecutor, is simply trying to uphold the law. Trump is not above the law and he must be held accountable.
But charging an ex-President (even one as CORRUPT and CRIMINAL as Trump) is controversial, so we need to gauge support among informed Democrats.
The Department of Justice will NEVER act unless we show public support, so we need your response immediately >>

THIS IS A COVER UP: And now Adam Schiff is opening an INVESTIGATION into why Trump is firing government watchdogs.
Remember: Nixon resigned because he was caught COVERING UP his crimes. So we KNOW Trump’s impeachment cover-up could be key to taking him down.

Donald Trump is lying, cheating, and abusing his power to PREVENT Americans from voting safely in November.
He’s SMEARING Joe Biden, baselessy accusing him of crimes, and spending MILLIONS on attack ads to peddle those lies in critical swing states.
But despite a national lead, Biden is still BEHIND in six critical swing states.
A national lead means nothing if we lose the Electoral College again!

Donald Trump said the US has the the best mortality rate in the world
Donald Trump will kill us all.
And top donors in are willing to do whatever it takes to prevent another Trump presidency. So they’ve agreed to 3X-MATCH every dollar donated by TONIGHT to this email to DEFEAT Trump this November. Will you donate?

Donald Trump is a failure and people are dying because of it:
\-- 143,000 people have died from Trump’s mishandling of COVID-19.
\-- Violent hate crimes hit a 16 year high due to Trump’s continued racist comments.
\-- OVER 100,000 people died from gun violence since Trump took office.
We’re desperate to kick him out. But, based on our projections,  we’re still $3,209 short of our weekly goal. If nothing changes, we won’t be able to fund our ads to DEFEAT Donald Trump!
This goes without saying, but allowing Trump to win the presidency again will mean more damage done and more lives lost. Will you donate a 3X-MATCHED $5 now to help us DEFEAT Donald Trump immediately?

If we can’t afford our ads, that means 4 more years of ZERO leadership and ZERO gun safety reform.
Trump knows Biden is leading him in the polls and is getting desperate. Now the NRA is FUNNELING MILLIONS to support him and keep his ads running.
They are crushing us with their ads. The NRA can’t wait to keep their President who couldn’t care less about gun reform.

Pandemic Escalates Domestic Abuse and Reduces Chances to Flee - NPR
With the nation trapped inside, domestic abuse is rising. And thanks to the “Boyfriend Loophole”, abusers can purchase guns LEGALLY!
That means victims of domestic violence are housebound with violent abusers who have legal access to dangerous weapons.
We must end this nightmare. Click to demand Congress close the “Boyfriend Loophole” >>
ADD MY NAME >>
If 25,000 activists sign this petition before 10 am, we can FORCE Congress to close this deadly loophole
Victims of domestic violence live in a constant state of fear.
But because of a horrible and dangerous policy called the “Boyfriend Loophole,” even if their abusers are convicted for their crimes, they can still legally purchase guns.
The NRA has been fighting tooth and nail to keep this policy on the books.
They don’t care who gets their hands on these deadly weapons as long as guns are selling and the NRA is happy.
So, we’re circulating this petition to CLOSE the Boyfriend Loophole and keep deadly weapons out of the wrong hands.
We need 25,000 activists to sign and send a strong message to Congress. Add your name today to close the Boyfriend Loophole >>
ADD MY NAME >>
Listen, closing the Boyfriend Loophole will save thousands of lives.
That’s because gun violence and domestic violence are intertwined. Just look at some of these devastating statistics:
\-- 1 in 3 women have been the victim of physical violence or stalking by an intimate partner.
\-- In 2016, 1 in 3 women murdered were killed by an intimate partner with a gun.
\-- About every 16 hours, a woman is shot and killed by a former or current partner.
This is appalling.
Closing the Boyfriend Loophole won’t end domestic violence. But it is a CRITICAL first step in keeping thousands of victims safe.
If 25,000 activists sign our petition, we could help close this loophole for good.
Will you sign to close the Boyfriend Loophole right away?

Business Insider: Trump Reportedly Rejected Approving a Bailout Package that would Rescue the US Postal Service, and It Could Be a Disaster for States Trying to Expand Voting by Mail
The United States has plunged the US Postal Service into dire financial straits, as more Americans than ever rely on post offices to deliver necessary medicine and supplies, especially in underserved rural areas.
House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Gerry Conolly, who runs the subcommittee that oversees the Postal Service, sounded the alarm that the agency could run out of funding altogether by June if Congress doesn’t act soon.
'Based on a number of briefings and warnings this week about a critical fall-off in mail across the country, it has become clear that the Postal Service will not survive the summer without immediate help from Congress and the White House,' the two said in a March 23 joint statement, calling on Congress to appropriate $25 million in emergency funds to the agency.

As states have steadily expanded absentee and mail-in voting over the past two decades, the proportion of Americans voting in-person on election day has declined from 90% in 1992 to 60% in 2016, according to the US Census Bureau.
But some Republicans have openly protested expanding vote by mail options because they believe it would hurt them politically.  Trump said in a recent 'Fox & Friends' appearance that the House's stimulus provisions had 'levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.'
Since then, Trump has continued to spread misinformation about the safety and security of voting by mail on his Twitter account, falsely claiming that it 'substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD,' which none of the available evidence on vote by mail supports.

This is an official Progressive Turnout Project opinion poll. Please respond even if you are “Unsure”. You have 3 minutes to submit your answer.
Donald Trump has been abusing his position since the first day he became president.
He’s used his power and influence to end criminal investigations and avoid conviction.
And enough is enough. Trump needs to be held accountable for his crimes.
But Congress will only charge Trump if it’s what the American people want.
That’s why we’re issuing an urgent public opinion poll today to gauge what our top supporters think. And we really need to hear from you:

Business Insider explains it best: (we’ve included the most important parts)
Business Insider: Trump Reportedly Rejected Approving a Bailout Package that would Rescue the US Postal Service, and It Could Be a Disaster for States Trying to Expand Voting by Mail
The United States has plunged the US Postal Service into dire financial straits, as more Americans than ever rely on post offices to deliver necessary medicine and supplies, especially in underserved rural areas.
House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Gerry Conolly, who runs the subcommittee that oversees the Postal Service, sounded the alarm that the agency could run out of funding altogether by June if Congress doesn’t act soon.
'Based on a number of briefings and warnings this week about a critical fall-off in mail across the country, it has become clear that the Postal Service will not survive the summer without immediate help from Congress and the White House,' the two said in a March 23 joint statement, calling on Congress to appropriate $25 million in emergency funds to the agency.

TELL CONGRESS TO SAVE THE POST OFFICE

As states have steadily expanded absentee and mail-in voting over the past two decades, the proportion of Americans voting in-person on election day has declined from 90% in 1992 to 60% in 2016, according to the US Census Bureau.
But some Republicans have openly protested expanding vote by mail options because they believe it would hurt them politically.  Trump said in a recent 'Fox & Friends' appearance that the House's stimulus provisions had 'levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.'
Since then, Trump has continued to spread misinformation about the safety and security of voting by mail on his Twitter account, falsely claiming that it 'substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD,' which none of the available evidence on vote by mail supports.

The U.S. Postal Service is a critical and beloved institution.
And their role in delivering millions of mail-in ballots this November will prove to be critical to the 2020 Election.
But Republicans are terrified by the prospect of increased voter turnout ‑‑ so they’re determined to run the U.S. Post Office into the ground!
We CANNOT let that happen.

I’m asking you for $5 to help me defeat Devin Nunes (Trump’s FAVORITE Congressman). Here’s why:
* Polls are SO CLOSE. And Devin barely won re-election in 2018.
* Trump is scared to death of our campaign. He knows we can really win.
* Republicans are FLOODING Devin Nunes with cash to crush our campaign!
In all honesty, their Republican mega-bucks could sink us. I won’t have the resources to compete without your help.
Can you split $5 between my campaign and the Progressive Turnout Project today? It will go directly toward defeating Devin Nunes and we’ll strike a HUGE blow against Trump in November →
CLICK HERE TO DONATE $5 AND DEFEAT DEVIN NUNES →
Devin Nunes is “Trump’s favorite Republican”.
He spreads deadly COVID conspiracy theories on Fox News. Spews lies about Vote-by-Mail. And always covers up Trump’s crimes and corruption!
Republicans LOVE it --- that’s why he has so much campaign cash.
But I know that we can take this seat back with your help.
Your $5 could make all the difference. Let’s defeat Devin Nunes together. Click to donate >>

Listen --
The U.S. Postal Service will be gone THIS SUMMER without immediate help.
This would END vote-by-mail and spell DISASTER for the entire 2020 Election!
Congress needs to act NOW: Sign the petition to demand Congress FULLY FUND the Post Office and PROTECT vote‑by‑mail >>
Business Insider explains it best: (we’ve included the most important parts)
Business Insider: Trump Reportedly Rejected Approving a Bailout Package that would Rescue the US Postal Service, and It Could Be a Disaster for States Trying to Expand Voting by Mail
The United States has plunged the US Postal Service into dire financial straits, as more Americans than ever rely on post offices to deliver necessary medicine and supplies, especially in underserved rural areas.
House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Gerry Conolly, who runs the subcommittee that oversees the Postal Service, sounded the alarm that the agency could run out of funding altogether by June if Congress doesn’t act soon.
'Based on a number of briefings and warnings this week about a critical fall-off in mail across the country, it has become clear that the Postal Service will not survive the summer without immediate help from Congress and the White House,' the two said in a March 23 joint statement, calling on Congress to appropriate $25 million in emergency funds to the agency.

As states have steadily expanded absentee and mail-in voting over the past two decades, the proportion of Americans voting in-person on election day has declined from 90% in 1992 to 60% in 2016, according to the US Census Bureau.
But some Republicans have openly protested expanding vote by mail options because they believe it would hurt them politically.  Trump said in a recent 'Fox & Friends' appearance that the House's stimulus provisions had 'levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.'
Since then, Trump has continued to spread misinformation about the safety and security of voting by mail on his Twitter account, falsely claiming that it 'substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD,' which none of the available evidence on vote by mail supports.

The U.S. Postal Service is a critical and beloved institution.
And their role in delivering millions of mail-in ballots this November will prove to be critical to the 2020 Election.
But Republicans are terrified by the prospect of increased voter turnout ‑‑ so they’re determined to run the U.S. Post Office into the ground!
We CANNOT let that happen.

I’m asking you for $5 to help me defeat Devin Nunes (Trump’s FAVORITE Congressman). Here’s why:
* Polls are SO CLOSE. And Devin barely won re-election in 2018.
* Trump is scared to death of our campaign. He knows we can really win.
* Republicans are FLOODING Devin Nunes with cash to crush our campaign!
In all honesty, their Republican mega-bucks could sink us. I won’t have the resources to compete without your help.
Can you split $5 between my campaign and the Progressive Turnout Project today? It will go directly toward defeating Devin Nunes and we’ll strike a HUGE blow against Trump in November →

Devin Nunes is “Trump’s favorite Republican”.
He spreads deadly COVID conspiracy theories on Fox News. Spews lies about Vote-by-Mail. And always covers up Trump’s crimes and corruption!
Republicans LOVE it --- that’s why he has so much campaign cash.
But I know that we can take this seat back with your help.
Your $5 could make all the difference. Let’s defeat Devin Nunes together. Click to donate >>

792,"homicides are up by double-digits in major cities across America this year – and it’s a wake-up call that our country can’t afford the Left’s agenda
Claudia for Congress
Friend,
This year has devastated so many communities across America, and the situation is only being made worse by Democrats who are terrified of facing the facts about their failed leadership.
We need to address what’s going on in our major cities right now.
* Homicides have risen by double-digits in 36 out of America’s 50 largest cities so far this year.
* Recent polls show that 77% of Americans are concerned about rising crime in our cities.
Democrats know why this is happening, but they’ll never admit that they’re the reason!
The Left’s radical crusade against law enforcement is taking a devastating toll on lives and communities across our country, and it will only get worse if we don’t stand up to their anti-police agenda before it’s too late.
CHIP IN TO RESTORE LAW & ORDER THIS NOVEMBER
Our men and women in blue are watching our communities fall apart right now, and they’re calling for backup from Washington – but Democrats like Anthony Brindisi refuse to answer the call!
That’s because Brindisi is more loyal to Pelosi than he is to our police departments, our district, and even the voters who supported him in 2018!
That’s why the New York State Troopers PBA just endorsed our campaign. They’re sick and tired of being abandoned by Congress, and they’re counting on us to change that.

Friend,
New campaign ads. New endorsements. New quotes from top Democrats that you have to read to believe. This week on the campaign trail had it all. Here’s all the top headlines to catch up on from this week before you head into the holiday weekend!
⬇️ TOP HEADLINE FROM THIS WEEK ⬇️
These Veterans Aren’t Taking Brindisi’s BS in Our Latest Ad
Brindisi’s BS
America’s military veterans deserve more than cheap lip service from career politicians – but that’s all Anthony Brindisi has to offer them. Instead of fighting for veterans like Brindisi promised back in 2018, he’s only fought for Nancy Pelosi’s America-last agenda, and our vets have paid the price ever since.
Watch the ad and chip in to keep it going!
United We Stand with the Remington Arms Workers’ Union!
United We Stand
Remington Arms isn’t just the oldest gun manufacturer in the country still in operation – it’s a cornerstone of our local community, an important piece of our nation’s history, and an institution that our district can’t afford to lose. I’m honored to have earned this endorsement, and I’m ready to get back in the fight for Remington Arms from Washington!

Once Again, Cuomo Chooses to Divide – Instead of Choosing to Lead
The Divider
Governor Cuomo called President Trump the “worst president in history” and said that he “better have an army” if he ever plans to return to New York. Cuomo has never been more out of touch with Upstate New York voters than he is now, and it’s time for him to focus on the real issues at hand – rising violence, crime, and anarchy in NYC!

Pelosi’s Blow-Out Doesn’t Go As Planned
LOL
Pelosi’s hypocrisy was on full display this week after she was seen getting a blow-out at a San Francisco salon without wearing a mask – and according to Pelosi, it was all a “setup” by the salon owner to damage her reputation. Brindisi’s boss doesn’t deserve two more minutes in Washington – much less two years!

794,"Anthony Brindisi is working hard to let lawlessness and crime take over our district. Not on my watch.
Claudia for Congress
Friend,
Americans in big cities across the country are suffering under the weight of rising crime right now, and it’s easy to see why.
Democrat mayors in charge of Seattle, Chicago, and New York – just to name a few – have abandoned their police officers and let lawlessness, looting, and violence take over their cities.
Now, Anthony Brindisi is working with Nancy Pelosi to let lawlessness take over our own district by voting to defund the police and voting to release dangerous prisoners early.
Not on my watch.
This is just the tip of the iceberg of failed Democrat leadership – and it’s only going to get worse if Brindisi, Biden, and Pelosi win on November 3rd and take over Washington.
That’s why I need to know where you stand.
Friend, the rising crime that we’re seeing across the country right now could have all been avoided – but Democrats chose to sit on the sidelines and do nothing to stop it.
America can’t prosper without a strong rule of law and strong police departments to keep us safe, and that’s why I’m running to strengthen law & order starting right here in NY-22.
With just 77 days to go until we cast our votes, I need to know that you’re with me on this issue.
What will you choose on November 3rd?

Celebrating National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day
National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day
Law Enforcement Appreciation Day should be recognized every day in our communities. We are thankful for the sacrifices made by those who answer the call to serve in this noble profession. Political leaders in Albany have enacted dangerous laws under the guise of reform that put our communities and those who serve at risk.
Sadly, towns and cities within New York’s 22nd Congressional District have been ranked among the most dangerous in New York in terms of recent crime rate statistics. Politicians in Albany and Washington must act now to repeal and amend those laws to protect our citizens and law enforcement officials, not put them at greater risk.

Friend,
With America in crisis, President Trump and conservatives in Congress have worked hard to prioritize solutions, provide relief, and support our small businesses.
Nancy Pelosi and her pals, like our own Anthony Brindisi have been using this same time to push their unpopular, radical agenda.
They’re out there promoting things like the green new deal, demanding reparations and tax cuts for their millionaire pals. They’re calling for “crimes against humanity” charges against President Trump.

Friend, the obstruction we’ve seen from liberals in Congress is truly unprecedented.
This is NOT the time for radical tactics and partisan policies. Our families and our business are at stake! Our hospitals and health providers are fearing the worst and our small businesses are struggling.
There is NO EXCUSE for pushing these unpopular Democrat priorities when people are truly suffering.

Friend,
It’s official: President Trump just nominated Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court!
Amy Coney Barrett is a proven defender of religious liberty, life, and the Constitution, and that’s exactly the type of justice that we need on the bench at a time like this when America is at a crossroads.
And just like clockwork, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and the rest of the Swamp are obstructing her confirmation with threats of another baseless impeachment against President Trump for the crime of performing his Constitutional duty.
Friend, you and I both know where Anthony Brindisi stands on impeachment.
Claudia for Congress
Brindisi has never been more out of touch with Upstate New York and his record proves it.
His values don’t represent the values we stand for and his agenda doesn’t come close to addressing the real problems we’re dealing with on a daily basis in our district.
It’s time to strengthen our police departments, work alongside President Trump to move America forward, and create jobs right here within our own communities.
We’re running out of time to make that happen.
Election Day is just 38 days out – but our quarterly fundraising deadline is only four days away and I need your help to prove to Brindisi that our grassroots team is still stronger than Pelosi’s blank checks.
Everything we do right now can make or break this fight for NY-22’s future.

Friend,
Every day, there are new stories of dangerous criminals who are now roaming the streets thanks to dangerous bail reform policies implemented by Anthony Brindisi’s closest ally in Albany, Governor Cuomo and the out of control Democrats in Albany.
So far, robbers, murderers, and drunken hit-and-run drivers have been set free under bail reform. Unsurprisingly, many of those released have committed more crimes.
This issue affects everyone in New York, so we need to hear from you directly.

Instead of trusting New York’s law enforcement and judges, liberal Democrats in Albany upended the criminal justice system with soft-on-crime bail reform. As a result, these criminals’ victims and the general public are at risk, and the authorities responsible for holding them accountable have been constrained.
The General Assembly rushed to craft dangerous, headline-grabbing reforms instead of working with law enforcement officials to craft a policy that would make public safety a top priority. The future of our state is at risk thanks to short-sighted and dysfunctional actions in Albany.
Because this policy is so dangerous, we need signatures from 5,000 New Yorkers by midnight!
Do you oppose New York’s failed bail reform?
Add your name!
It’s time to stand up to the dysfunction in Albany! Make your voice heard on bail reform now: [[URL REDACTED]]

800,"From new ads to the Democratic National Convention – here’s everything that impacted our campaign to take back NY-22 this week
Claudia for Congress
Friend,
From launching new ads, to meeting more voters across the district, backing the blue, and watching the Democratic Party’s National Zoom Convention, it’s been a massive week for our campaign – and our country. Here’s the top headlines that affected our race this week:
⬇️ FEATURED HEADLINE OF THE WEEK ⬇️
Brindisi Failed NY-22’s Cops – Hear it Straight From Them in Our Latest Ad!
Brindisi Failed
Officers Murphy and Salce said it best – Anthony Brindisi failed to do his duty, he only serves his party, and he only protects Nancy Pelosi. These police officers know exactly what’s at stake in this election, and our campaign needs your help to spread their message to every corner of NY-22 over the final 74 days of this campaign.
Watch the full ad and chip in to keep it on the air.
Ending Qualified Immunity would Bankrupt Cops – and Brindisi would Profit From it!
B.S. Brindisi
Brindisi’s efforts to undermine law enforcement are extreme – but they aren’t new. Brindisi has been working for years to expose police officers by stripping away legal protections of qualified immunity. National Review revealed this week that if he’s successful, he and his inner circle would receive tens of thousands in lobby donations – another brick to add to his wall of fraud.

Backing the Blue with Hundreds of Others Across Broome County!
Back the blue
Voters across the district know exactly what’s at stake in this race – and they’re doing everything they possibly can to protect the future of every man and woman who faithfully defends the thin blue line in our communities. This is one of the most important causes of our lives, and I’m thankful for every single one of you fighting alongside me in this race.

Biden’s Record of Failure was on Full Display at the DNC – and Brindisi’s Ready to Back It Up 100%
Biden-Brindisi
Joe Biden wrapped up the Democratic National Convention last night by outlining his plan to raise taxes, drive businesses off our shores, and put the needs of violent protesters ahead of our police. Anthony Brindisi is all-in on his radical agenda just like he was all-in as a Hillary delegate back in 2016 – and it’s our job to stop it in November.

President Trump Marks 100 Years of the 19th Amendment in a BIG Way!
Susan B. Anthony
This week marked the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment which gave women the right to vote – and President Trump honored the legacy of Susan B. Anthony by pardoning her for her crime of voting. That history has roots right here in our district as the first women voted in Lisle, and I commend President Trump for this decision!

Keeping Manufacturing Jobs in America Starts Right Here in NY-22
National Pipe
Millions of jobs are on the ballot this November – and we can’t afford to get this wrong. It was a pleasure to tour National Pipe and Plastics earlier this week where we discussed the importance of keeping manufacturing jobs here in America, keeping taxes at a minimum, and getting tough on China for working to weaken our economy!

Honoring the Legacy of Teddy Kaczor
Teddy Kaczor
Thank you to everyone who came out to remember Teddy on our memorial ride this week. Teddy served our district for 20 years with the Utica Police Department, and an additional 21 years with the NYS Attorney General’s Office. Teddy was an outstanding figure in our communities, and he will be sorely missed by many across NY-22.

Friend,  in a time of crisis, Americans should be coming together…
And in so many ways, we are. I’ve seen great things from our communities and our great businesses working to help one another in this time of need.
But in Congress - you don’t see that - not from the partisan liberals like Nancy Pelosi and Anthony Brindisi, anyway.
They’re not using this time to remember their duties or patriotism, they’re using it to push a partisan, anti-Trump agenda, NO MATTER WHO IT HURTS.
And it’s time to say ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
I AGREE: TELL LIBERALS IN CONGRESS TO GET TO WORK >>
Anthony Brindisi should be fighting for New York right now. We’ve been hit HARD by the Coronavirus and our community, our healthcare workers, and our small businesses are truly struggling.
But instead of fighting for THEM, he’s looking to earn favor with the radical elites who are out there promoting things like the green new deal, demanding reparations and tax cuts for their millionaire pals, and calling for “crimes against humanity” charges against President Trump.
This hyper-partisan game playing has passed the point of offensive and entered the territory of pure madness. It’s time to send our own message on behalf of the people of NY-22: ENOUGH IS ENOUGH - Congress needs to get to WORK for US!
ADD YOUR NAME: SIGN THE PETITION >>
Friend, in the state of New York, we're dealing with thousands more new cases of Coronavirus daily and millions of dollars lost for business.

802,"The Swamp is threatening another baseless impeachment against President Trump – and we already know where Brindisi stands on that issue
Claudia for Congress
Friend,
It’s official: President Trump just nominated Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court!
Amy Coney Barrett is a proven defender of religious liberty, life, and the Constitution, and that’s exactly the type of justice that we need on the bench at a time like this when America is at a crossroads.
And just like clockwork, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and the rest of the Swamp are obstructing her confirmation with threats of another baseless impeachment against President Trump for the crime of performing his Constitutional duty.
Friend, you and I both know where Anthony Brindisi stands on impeachment.
Claudia for Congress
Brindisi has never been more out of touch with Upstate New York and his record proves it.
His values don’t represent the values we stand for and his agenda doesn’t come close to addressing the real problems we’re dealing with on a daily basis in our district.
It’s time to strengthen our police departments, work alongside President Trump to move America forward, and create jobs right here within our own communities.
We’re running out of time to make that happen.
Election Day is just 38 days out – but our quarterly fundraising deadline is only four days away and I need your help to prove to Brindisi that our grassroots team is still stronger than Pelosi’s blank checks.
Everything we do right now can make or break this fight for NY-22’s future.
Can I count on you to help us finish this quarter strong and send our campaign into October with the wind at our backs?

803,"Impeachment, USMCA, endorsements and more!
Claudia for Congress
Friend,
These past few weeks have been busy for our campaign. We’ve held Anthony Brindisi accountable on impeachment, received endorsements from some of the biggest names in the Republican Party, participated in the Fidelis Care Stuff the Bus drive, and more.
Anthony Brindisi Votes “Yes” on Impeachment
Anthonhy Brindisi
This week, Anthony Brindisi and the do-nothing Democrats impeached President Trump. Our district elected Trump in 2016 by over 15%, but Anthony has supported impeachment at every step of the process. He has betrayed the hard-working people of Upstate New York.
Brindisi Votes to Kick Millions off Medicare
Bridisi Votes to Kick Millions off Medicare
One day after voting for impeachment, Anthony Brindisi voted against opposing a government takeover of healthcare that could kick millions of American seniors off Medicare. We deserve better than the false promises of Anthony Brindisi.
Endorsed by Kevin McCarthy, Minority Leader in the U.S. House of Representatives
Kevin McCarthy
A couple of weeks ago, I was endorsed by Kevin McCarthy, Minority Leader in the U.S. House of Representatives. He has a proven track record of delivering real results for this country, and he knows I have what it takes to beat Anthony Brindisi in 2020.
ICYMI: Other Major Endorsements
Steve Scalise
A few weeks ago, I was endorsed by Republican Whip Steve Scalise. We have also received endorsements from major groups in the Republican Party including the Oswego County Republican Committee and Winning For Women. Republican leadership and conservative groups are paying attention to this race because we have a real shot at taking this seat back from Anthony Brindisi and liberal democrats.
Stuff the Bus Toy Drive
Toy Drive
Last week, I took gifts to the Stuff the Bus Drive hosted by Fidelis Care in Utica. It’s a great cause that brings our community together and something I look forward to every year!
Dysfunction in Albany on Bail Reform
Albany Bail Reform
Bail reform signed into law by Governor Cuomo has been disastrous for our state, and showcases the dysfunction in Albany. Their plan isn’t even fully implemented yet, but each week there are new stories of dangerous criminals back on the streets committing more crimes.
House Passes United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
Unites States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
Yesterday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Anthony Brindisi and Democrats in Congress prioritized impeaching the President over passing USMCA all year costing Upstate New York millions of dollars and putting the state of our dairy farmers at risk. I am glad to see the provisions I fought so hard for including those for our dairy farmers and small businesses included in this USMCA package and I am glad the President will finally sign the agreement.
Cortland County Visit
Cortland County Visit
I was honored to attend the Cortland County Women’s Republican lunch where I met Marissa, one of the winners of the poster contest. Young, conservative women like Marissa are the future of the Republican Party!

804,"CO Pride Flag
Friends,
Every June, we celebrate Pride month here in Colorado and across the country. It's a time to lift up the LGBTQIA+ community and activists who have fought -- and continue to fight -- for their right to full equality under law.
And this June in particular, we must remember that the first Pride was a protest against discrimination, bigotry, and police brutality. Pride is certainly a time for celebration and parades, but until everyone in the LGBTQIA+ community has the same rights and protections as everyone else, it will also always be a national protest against inequality and injustice.
When President Obama repealed Don't Ask, Don't Tell, I was proud to stand up with him and for Colorado values at the 2012 Democratic National Convention -- but we still have a ways to go. Victories like this week's landmark Supreme Court decision have been hard-fought. From marriage equality and hate crimes legislation to federal nondiscrimination protections, the LGBTQIA+ community has continued to face violence and discrimination throughout their decades of activism.
And still today, too many members of the LGBTQIA+ community -- especially BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) transgender women -- experience high rates of violence. It is vital we address this often deadly prejudice head-on and ensure that all Americans have the support and protections they need to not merely survive, but thrive.
Join me in honoring the activists who ignited the movement for equality, and recommit to combating injustice against the LGBTQIA+ community. Add your name now to pledge to keep fighting alongside them every step of the way towards full, lived equality in this country >>
Happy Pride,
Jason

China’s utter lack of transparency and total mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak has cost so many lives, tens of millions of jobs in the United States alone and left massive economic destruction in its wake!
That’s why I’ve called for a Congressional investigation into the origin of the virus, but whether it started in a Chinese lab, at a disgusting Chinese wet market or somewhere else, the communist Chinese officials who hid what was happening need to be held accountable for their crimes against humanity!
So, today, I introduced a bill in Congress to hold China accountable and make them pay back the American taxpayers for every dollar we have spent combating this invisible enemy!
We will do this by withholding payments on debts owed to China until the full cost is repaid to American taxpayers! If you agree that we must make China pay, please sign our petition ASAP:

We are reaching out to thank everyone who helped us meet our fundraising goal for the month of August! As a result, we are in a good position to fight off national Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from trying to flip our community's seat blue.
More than 4,000 individual donors donated last month, and I can’t thank our supporters enough for making this possible!
KEEP UP YOUR SUPPORT
Yet with a little over two months to go until the election, September will be our biggest challenge yet. I completely understand if you weren’t able to make a contribution in August for a host of reasons, but I am asking that you please consider making a donation this month if you can spare a few dollars.
Having the far-left win in our district would mean their weak stance on crime and immigration would come to our community. It also would likely mean a massive tax increase on all of us.

Across the country, we are seeing cowardly politicians bow down to the liberal mob and abandon their fundamental responsibility to protect people by defunding their police departments. Following Los Angeles County slashing $145 million from the Sheriff's Department - targeting the gang unit, human trafficking, crimes involving children, rape, and major crimes bureau, New York City's Mayor De Blasio went further and gut-punched the NYPD with a billion-dollar cut as shootings and violent crime surges.
Instead of supporting these foolish policies of defunding our police, we must defend our police departments and the vital public safety they provide our families. Will you stand with me in defense of our courageous officers who are putting their lives on the line every day?
Stand with our Police
In our district, we even have a leading liberal candidate inciting violence and calling for rioters to ""Burn it to the ground.""
These statements to defund our police and burn our communities to the ground are no longer a fringe argument. Public safety or protecting our citizens and businesses isn't remotely a priority in the eyes of the extremists who run the Democrat Party.
I need your help today to stand against these destructive policies, will you join our campaign to support public safety for our families and communities with a $10 donation?

Before President Trump even took the oath of office, Democrats made it their mission to destroy his presidency. They had an agenda and hard core partisans placed in our intelligence community to take unprecedented and illegal actions in order to manufacture an investigation of ""crimes"" and ""collusion"" that never  existed.
A string of recently released documents has confirmed the entire Russia-Trump investigation, which eventually entrapped General Michael Flynn, was an extraordinary abuse of power and an organized effort by liberals to nullify the results of the 2016 presidential election. It was, in effect, an attempted coup.
Help reveal the truth about the liberal coup >>
These deep state bureaucrats think they run this country because Liberals and the media empower them. This is far more insidious than standard party-line politics. Our country's most valuable intelligence and law enforcement organizations cannot have a party affiliation or agenda. Please add your name to our list to help stop the weaponization of our intelligence community so this never happens again.
Don't let dems empower our intelligence community!
It is easy to get overwhelmed and tune it out, fall behind, or accept the national media's dishonest reporting. The ongoing revelations about the targeting of Michael Flynn can't be ignored. No matter how high this may go, the American people deserve to know who initiated this abuse of power and what they did to carry out their mission to destroy the Trump presidency, even as it was just getting started.
DONATE >>>
As your Representative, I will be a first line of defense to expose and stop these destructive acts from occurring. As Texans, we won't tolerate this abuse of power. With your support TODAY, we can continue to expose, and bring to justice, those who think they are above the law and above the people of our great nation!

Across District 24, folks will be seeing our first TV ad, and I wanted to make sure you saw it!
The ad focuses on the work I did as Irving Mayor, and a city councilwoman, to coordinate our police force with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to take illegal immigrants, who committed crimes in our city, off the streets, and out of our country. Plain and simple: when criminal illegals commit crimes, they must be deported.
As a result, we cut the crime rate citywide. Irving had the lowest crime rate 9 years running and was named one of the top 10 safest cities in America. We were also one of the fastest-growing cities in the nation.

Sen. John Cornyn: How we can police our communities better
Reforms at the state and local levels will be the biggest drivers of change.

Shelley Moore Capito, [[URL REDACTED]], and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., speaks at a news conference to announce a Republican police reform bill on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, June 17, 2020, in Washington.(Andrew Harnik)
The killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis was a brutal, senseless and avoidable tragedy, and one our country has witnessed countless times before. In many ways, his death was the match that ignited nationwide conversations about the racial injustices that have existed in our country for generations. These systemic problems have led to inequalities in everything from education, to health care, to housing, and while each of these must be addressed, the most important place to start is with police reforms.
In a recent poll conducted by The Washington Post and George Mason University, nearly 70% of Americans agreed that Floyd’s death was a sign of broader problems in the treatment of Black Americans by police. While there’s widespread agreement that change is needed, there’s no consensus on what that change should look like. In order to get there, it’s important to listen and learn from a variety of voices.
Over the past few weeks, I’ve teamed up with the mayors of both Dallas and Houston to host roundtable discussions with law enforcement, faith and community leaders. During our conversation in Dallas, Sheriff Marian Brown said, “We have to reach a point where we are comfortable having uncomfortable conversations.” Whether in Congress, workplaces or homes, these discussions aren’t easy, and for too long the topic has been avoided altogether. But progress can only happen if we’re having these important conversations and following up with action.
Reforms at the state and local levels will be the biggest drivers of change. This is where decisions are made about hiring, data sharing and day-to-day police activities. By and large, that’s a good thing — a one-size-fits-all rulebook would create more problems than solutions. But there are basic practices that should be standard across the board, and Congress has a responsibility to ensure all police departments are transparent, accountable and well-trained.
In the Senate, I’ve worked closely with Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., in developing the Just and Unifying Solutions to Invigorate Communities Everywhere Act to reform, retrain and restore trust in America’s police officers. This legislation helps end chokeholds and addresses no-knock warrants, two practices which — for good reason — have been brought into question by recent events. It ensures our officers receive critical de-escalation trainings, properly use body cameras, report critical data and are held accountable for mistakes. This legislation also improves minority hiring in police forces, orders a top-to-bottom review of our criminal justice system, and makes lynching a federal crime.
It takes a number of steps to deliver both immediate and lasting changes in communities across the country, and last week, the Senate took a routine procedural vote to begin working on this bill. Those voting yes – as I did – agreed to start the process of discussing, debating and amending this police reform bill. This wasn’t a vote to pass the bill, or preclude any changes, just a simple, straightforward step to get the process moving.
Unfortunately, Democrats blocked the bill. They prevented the Senate from even debating this legislation by claiming it was “inadequate.” They refused to negotiate, offer amendments, or try to engage in any meaningful or productive way. When given the opportunity to follow their calls for action with actual progress, they chose to simply vote “no.”
It was a disappointing show of priorities and a tremendous loss for our country, which is hungry for reform. Despite this setback, however, I will continue to press forward and encourage my colleagues to pass the sensible reforms we all agree are necessary.
During a roundtable discussion in Dallas a few weeks ago, Police Chief Renée Hall discussed how policing strategies over the years have created a wedge between law enforcement and their communities, and we’re going to have to work to fix it.
I don’t claim to have all the answers, but I’m confident that stonewalling the Senate will not lead to progress. Every person — regardless of skin color, political party, age or background — must be willing to do the work. This uncomfortable national conversation is long overdue, and it’s time we seize this opportunity to create real reforms. Instead of accepting “no,” it’s time to demand, “yes.”

Friend,
Senator Cornyn asked me to pull a fresh list of folks who took action to defend President Trump from impeachment.
Remember, now that Pelosi decided to stop her power grab, and articles of impeachment have been delivered to the Senate, President Trump is standing trial.
This is a critical moment in the history of our nation.
Senator Cornyn wants to see exactly who is standing with him. Will you make sure your name is on the list?

Friend,
Nancy Pelosi’s impeachment effort has been wrong for our country from day one. It was a rushed process. It was an incomplete process. It was a process that identified a punishment, then searched for a crime… It was a complete circus, and Nancy was the ringleader.
The Democrats have been at this charade for years. First it was Russian collusion, then obstruction of justice, then campaign finance law abuses and then violations of the “Emoluments Clause.” In each case, these outrageous accusations turned out to be untrue. Yet Democrats only looked harder for another excuse.
Now, we find ourselves heading into an official trial which could result in President Trump’s expulsion from office. Having tried every other trick in the book, the Democrats have now pushed our Constitution to the limit.
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… As someone who served as a district judge, state Supreme Court justice and Texas Attorney General and now sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, I want to know…
* What happened to the presumption of innocence in all this?
* While Democrats say no one is above the law, why can’t they point to the law they think the President violated?
* What happened to fundamental fairness? The House sat behind closed doors and concentrated all control in the hands of six Democratic committee chairmen. Where is the fairness?
As your Senator, I will be called upon to respond after House Democrats have rushed to impeach the President. That day has arrived.
Chuck Schumer and Liberal interest groups are already stepping up efforts to pressure me. They want to use impeachment as a tool to beat me and turn Texas blue.
But friend, I won’t budge.
I will start with the presumption of the President’s innocence. I will neither be sucked in nor fan the flames of wild rumors and political accusations.
The next few days represent a critical moment for America, and I need to know that you’re with me as I stand firm as the firewall between outrageous partisanship and the Constitution of the United States.
I’m asking you to join me by chipping in $25 to DEFEND our constitution.
In times like these, with so much on the line, we CAN’T afford to sit by idly...

The Democrats have been on a witch hunt since before our duly-elected president was even voted in to serve as our 45th commander in chief.
Senator Cornyn will be a central figure in this trial, and he WILL fight against the Left’s radical tactics… he will fight FOR President Trump.
Friend, we need your help to defend our innocent president. Are you with us? Will you chip in $25 now to show support of our 45th president?
CHIP IN $25 NOW
This whole impeachment process has been a sham. The Left has found no evidence against President Trump. Not a single Republican voted with the Democrats. This has been a partisan SHAM.
The clock is ticking. We are running out of time. We need you to reaffirm your commitment to our president. I need you to show me you are still committed to this fight. If you don’t show us, we will just take it as you wanting our president impeached AND removed.
I look forward to seeing your name on our donor’s list.
Thanks, friend.

Imagine your town, but with Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer in charge…
The Liberal Mob runs rampant through your streets.
Your local police force is defunded and reduced to nothing.

And your friends with well-paying energy jobs? They’re now unemployed thanks to the Green New Deal.
This is the future the Radical Left wants for us. They want to bring it to Texas, and they want to bring it quickly.
But friend, one man stands in the way of these dangerous leftists: John Cornyn. He’s fighting to keep Texas red. To defend the Senate majority. To keep our president in the White House.

Friend,
Nancy Pelosi’s impeachment effort has been wrong for our country from day one. It was a rushed process. It was an incomplete process. It was a process that identified a punishment, then searched for a crime… It was a complete circus, and Nancy was the ringleader.
The Democrats have been at this charade for years. First it was Russian collusion, then obstruction of justice, then campaign finance law abuses and then violations of the “Emoluments Clause.” In each case, these outrageous accusations turned out to be untrue. Yet Democrats only looked harder for another excuse.
Now, we find ourselves heading into an official trial which could result in President Trump’s expulsion from office. Having tried every other trick in the book, the Democrats have now pushed our Constitution to the limit.
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… As someone who served as a district judge, state Supreme Court justice and Texas Attorney General and now sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, I want to know…
* What happened to the presumption of innocence in all this?
* While Democrats say no one is above the law, why can’t they point to the law they think the President violated?
* What happened to fundamental fairness? The House sat behind closed doors and concentrated all control in the hands of six Democratic committee chairmen. Where is the fairness?
As your Senator, I will be called upon to respond after House Democrats have rushed to impeach the President. That day has arrived.
Chuck Schumer and Liberal interest groups are already stepping up efforts to pressure me. They want to use impeachment as a tool to beat me and turn Texas blue.
But friend, I won’t budge.
I will start with the presumption of the President’s innocence. I will neither be sucked in nor fan the flames of wild rumors and political accusations.
The next few days represent a critical moment for America, and I need to know that you’re with me as I stand firm as the firewall between outrageous partisanship and the Constitution of the United States.
I’m asking you to join me by chipping in $25 to DEFEND our constitution.
In times like these, with so much on the line, we CAN’T afford to sit by idly...

Friend,
We’ve been saying this for a while but liberals from across the country want nothing more than to flip Texas blue. They know that if they win Texas, they will control all facets of government.
With a massive investment this year, they are banking on outside money putting them over the top.
They’re calling in all the Far-Left liberals from around the country to help: Chuck Schumer. Nancy Pelosi. Kamala Harris. Elizabeth Warren.
These coastal elites have no business here in Texas.
Friend, we simply can’t allow these radicals to buy our state.
KEEP TEXAS RED
Schumer knows that if he gets his way, he will have another rubber stamp for his radical agenda.
The top items on Schumer and the Far-Left’s list:
* Higher Taxes.
* Socialized Medicine.
* Open Borders.
* Defunding the Police.
Don’t let Schumer get another puppet in the Senate.

Friend, our opponent has been enlisting outside help to try and change Texas for good.
The latest Far-Left radical to try and meddle in Texas…. KAMALA HARRIS!
Take a look at what Kamala had to say about Texas:
KEEP TEXAS RED
Friend, she’s right. The impact would be catastrophic not only for Texas but the entire country.
WE CAN’T LET THIS HAPPEN.
Our opponent would rather pander to Far-Left radicals from across the country than defending the values of Texans right here in our state. Her campaign is being bankrolled by Coastal Elites and DC special interest groups. The question is: With all this outside help, what are they expecting in return?
Has she promised to turn Texas into the new California?
Higher Taxes.
Massive crime.
Uncontrollable cities.
We must keep Texas representative of and for Texans, NOT elites from California and New York.
Are you ready to take a stand and defend Texas?
KEEP TEXAS RED
Polls have shown a close race in Texas. Schumer and the DSCC have made a historic investment into flipping Texas this year.
It is vital we have the resources to answer back.

Friend,
This just happened – you may not have heard yet. I needed to bring you up to speed immediately… read carefully:
Today, Nancy Pelosi made a surprise, early-morning announcement about the impeachment of President Trump: She has asked the House to proceed with official articles of impeachment.
The Democrats have officially taken their politically-motivated impeachment process to the next level.
They have decided to abuse our Constitution… to use powers reserved for the highest crimes to remove a president that Democrats personally dislike.
During her announcement, Pelosi said that “the facts are uncontested...” despite the fact that these sham hearings have failed to produce a single verifiable fact.
It’s shameful, and tugs at the fabric of our democracy.
This is serious, friend, which is why I am asking you to take IMMEDIATE action to defend President Trump… Today, the impeachment of our president is officially closer than ever, and he needs to know we’re in his corner.

CHIP IN $25 NOW
This whole impeachment process has been a sham. The Left has found no evidence against President Trump. Not a single Republican voted with the Democrats. This has been a partisan SHAM.
The clock is ticking. We are running out of time. We need you to reaffirm your commitment to our president. I need you to show me you are still committed to this fight. If you don’t show us, we will just take it as you wanting our president impeached AND removed.
I look forward to seeing your name on our donor’s list.

Friend,
Senator Cornyn asked me to pull a fresh list of folks who took action to defend President Trump from impeachment.
Remember, now that Pelosi decided to stop her power grab, and articles of impeachment have been delivered to the Senate, President Trump is standing trial.
This is a critical moment in the history of our nation.
Senator Cornyn wants to see exactly who is standing with him. Will you make sure your name is on the list?

Nancy Pelosi’s impeachment effort has been wrong for our country from day one. It was a rushed process. It was an incomplete process. It was a process that identified a punishment, then searched for a crime… It was a complete circus, and Nancy was the ringleader.
The Democrats have been at this charade for years. First it was Russian collusion, then obstruction of justice, then campaign finance law abuses and then violations of the “Emoluments Clause.” In each case, these outrageous accusations turned out to be untrue. Yet Democrats only looked harder for another excuse.
Now, we find ourselves heading into an official trial which could result in President Trump’s expulsion from office. Having tried every other trick in the book, the Democrats have now pushed our Constitution to the limit.
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… As someone who served as a district judge, state Supreme Court justice and Texas Attorney General and now sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, I want to know…
* What happened to the presumption of innocence in all this?
* While Democrats say no one is above the law, why can’t they point to the law they think the President violated?
* What happened to fundamental fairness? The House sat behind closed doors and concentrated all control in the hands of six Democratic committee chairmen. Where is the fairness?
As your Senator, I will be called upon to respond after House Democrats have rushed to impeach the President. That day has arrived.
Chuck Schumer and Liberal interest groups are already stepping up efforts to pressure me. They want to use impeachment as a tool to beat me and turn Texas blue.
But friend, I won’t budge.
I will start with the presumption of the President’s innocence. I will neither be sucked in nor fan the flames of wild rumors and political accusations.
The next few days represent a critical moment for America, and I need to know that you’re with me as I stand firm as the firewall between outrageous partisanship and the Constitution of the United States.
I’m asking you to join me by chipping in $25 to DEFEND our constitution.
In times like these, with so much on the line, we CAN’T afford to sit by idly...

Friend,
It’s official. Donald J. Trump is now the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. The Democrats have taken their charade to the nth degree, using our Constitution as a partisan weapon.
This process began the day he was duly elected president, and culminated yesterday in a one-sided vote void of any fact or truly impeachable offense.
Yesterday was a sad day in American history. Democrats should be ashamed of their actions.
But friend, the longer we sit in silence, the more credibility we give Pelosi, Schiff, and Nadler.
We need to ban together and make a loud statement in defiance of the Left’s disgusting abuse of our Constitution, and we need to make it quickly.

John Cornyn calls impeachment case ‘half-baked,’ says it has bolstered Trump’s reelection prospects—and his own
Texan accuses Democrats of power grab and insists it has backfired
By Todd J. Gillman and Tom Benning
Published in the Dallas Morning News
February 5, 2020
Facebook Twitter
WASHINGTON — Hours before the Senate would vote on two articles of impeachment, Texas Sen. John Cornyn accused Democrats of trampling on the Constitution in service of a “crusade” to oust President Donald Trump.
In a floor speech Wednesday, he characterized the allegations as well short of the standards required to remove a president, particularly without bipartisan support and as Trump seeks reelection.
Unlike a handful of GOP colleagues, Cornyn expressed no dismay over the actions at the heart of the impeachment: a pressure campaign aimed at prodding Ukraine to announce a corruption probe targeting a political rival, Joe Biden, using U.S. military aid as leverage.
“Certainly the House managers did not meet the high burden required to remove the president from office, effectively nullifying the will of tens of millions of Americans, just month before the next election,” Cornyn said, who previously has called the effort “insane.”
“I hope our Democratic colleagues will finally accept the results of this trial, just as they have not accepted the results of the 2016 election,” he said.
The outcome of the trial is not in doubt. A two-thirds majority of senators is required to convict. Republicans control 53 of 100 seats and none have signaled an intention to vote for conviction. Still, a few have chastised Trump for his behavior. Others, among them Texas’ junior senator, Ted Cruz, have rallied behind Trump, conceding no hint of wrongdoing and vehemently accusing Democrats of pursuing a case that is factually baseless and constitutionally inadequate.
“Impeachment is an extraordinary remedy,” Cruz said during his 10-minute slot on Tuesday ahead of the vote. ""It’s not designed for when you have political differences or policy differences. It’s designed for when the president crosses the constitutional threshold.”
Cornyn is seeking a fourth six-year term in the fall, and Democrats hoping to unseat him have aggressively sought to turn his stance on impeachment to their advantage.
“Senator Cornyn has proven that he is uninterested in evidence and testimony and instead will continue to put political loyalty ahead of doing his job,” one of those Democratic contenders, M.J. Hegar, said earlier in the trial.
When Senate Republicans shot down demands from Democrats to call witnesses at the trial, Texas Democratic Party chair Gilberto Hinojosa said they “shamelessly... chose to support McConnell’s cover-up over upholding their constitutional oath.”
Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie noted that during the Senate trial, lawyers played snippets of testimony from 13 witnesses at the House impeachment hearings, and the trial record included 28,000 pages of documents. Democrats sought testimony from witnesses Trump ordered not to cooperate with the House, and to subpoena documents the administration refused to turn over to the House.
But even as Democrats insist that acquittal will give Trump and future presidents license to abuse their power, Cornyn argued that conviction in a “politically motivated impeachment sets a dangerous precedent.... If successful, this would give a green light to future congresses to weaponize impeachment to defeat a political opponent, for any action, even a failure to kowtow to Congress’s wishes.”
He previewed his floor remarks on conservative talk radio, telling host Hugh Hewitt earlier Wednesday that the case presented at trial “was simply half-baked. [[URL REDACTED]] the private sector, if lawyers had presented a case the way the impeachment managers did, they’d be sued for legal malpractice. It was just a disaster from the start, and so the president will be justly acquitted.”
On the Senate floor, Cornyn asserted that “they’ve failed to bring forward any unassailable evidence” of a high crime or misdemeanor of the sort required for impeachment.
Like nearly all GOP senators, Cornyn voted against calling any witnesses or demanding any documents from the White House, State Department or Pentagon that prosecutors sought, including testimony from Trump’s chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and former national security advisor, John Bolton.
Trump blocked testimony from those and other key players and issued a blanket refusal to turn over administration documents.
Democrats accused him of stonewalling. And they accused his allies in the Senate of enabling a cover-up, willfully blinding themselves to evidence that would have been even more persuasive than what the House did manage to collect despite the obstacles.
But impeachment, Cornyn said, should be used only “when absolutely necessary…. We should be extraordinarily vigilant to make sure that the impeachment power does not become a regular feature of our differences, and in the process, cheapen the vote of the American people.”
He ascribed partisan motives to Democrats, accusing them not only of trying to remove Trump — whose successor would be his hand-picked vice president, Mike Pence — but of flipping control of the Senate so that Democrat Chuck Schumer would replace Republican Mitch McConnell as majority leader.
Trump is the third president to be formally impeached. Richard Nixon resigned to avert impeachment over Watergate. No president has been removed from office.
“I’ve done my best to listen intently to both sides… and I’m confident in saying that President Trump should be acquitted, and not removed from office,” Cornyn said.
As for the implications on his reelection prospects, Cornyn told The Dallas Morning News off the Senate floor that “This isn’t just about this president. This is about the presidency itself and whether we trust the American people to choose their own leaders.
“If my Democratic friends who are running for the Senate have different views, I’d love to engage with them on the campaign trail on that. I think the Texas voters would be with me and not with this idea to remove a president from the ballot just months before the next presidential election.”
In fact, he said, the assault on Trump’s presidency has backfired.
“Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats are doing everything they can to see that he’s reelected,” he asserted.

Friend,
Imagine your town, but with Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer in charge…
The Liberal Mob runs rampant through your streets.
Your local police force is defunded and reduced to nothing.
Leaving no one to defend you from the crime spewing out of our wide open borders.
You can’t see your doctor anymore because of Medicare for All.
And your friends with well-paying energy jobs? They’re now unemployed thanks to the Green New Deal.
This is the future the Radical Left wants for us. They want to bring it to Texas, and they want to bring it quickly.
But friend, one man stands in the way of these dangerous leftists: John Cornyn. He’s fighting to keep Texas red. To defend the Senate majority. To keep our president in the White House.
But he needs your help, friend. In just a few days, he’ll hit an all-important deadline… the August End of Month deadline. He needs YOU to do anything you can to boost his fight. Will you chip in immediately?

Friend,
It’s official. Donald J. Trump is now the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. The Democrats have taken their charade to the nth degree, using our Constitution as a partisan weapon.
This process began the day he was duly elected president, and culminates today in a one-sided vote void of any fact or truly impeachable offense.
Today is a sad day in American history. Democrats should be ashamed of their actions.
But friend, the longer we sit in silence, the more credibility we give Pelosi, Schiff, and Nadler.
We need to ban together and make a loud statement in defiance of the Left’s disgusting abuse of our Constitution, and we need to make it quickly.
Will you join me by IMMEDIATELY showing just how much you REJECT this sham impeachment of President Trump?

Friend, our opponent has been enlisting outside help to try and change Texas for good.
The latest Far-Left radical to try and meddle in Texas…. KAMALA HARRIS!
Take a look at what Kamala had to say about Texas:
KEEP TEXAS RED
Friend, she’s right. The impact would be catastrophic not only for Texas but the entire country.
WE CAN’T LET THIS HAPPEN.
Our opponent would rather pander to Far-Left radicals from across the country than defending the values of Texans right here in our state. Her campaign is being bankrolled by Coastal Elites and DC special interest groups. The question is: With all this outside help, what are they expecting in return?
Has she promised to turn Texas into the new California?
Higher Taxes.
Massive crime.
Uncontrollable cities.
We must keep Texas representative of and for Texans, NOT elites from California and New York.
Are you ready to take a stand and defend Texas?

Image
Radical Left-Coaster Kamala Harris is barnstorming Texas today in a last ditch effort to do damage control after Joe Biden’s “transition from the oil industry” threat. While we don’t expect Harris’ apology tour to win over many voters, one Texan is all in with her radical agenda: MJ Hegar.
“Kamala Harris is the most liberal senator in DC. She co-sponsored Bernie Sanders’ Medicare-for-All plan and wants to tear apart ICE, and seems to have found a radical equal in MJ Hegar,” said Krista Piferrer, press secretary. “While their big government goals might resonate on Kamala’s Left-Coast turf, Texans aren’t interested in becoming California.”
Below is a dire warning of what Texas would look like with a Harris-Hegar Duo...
On energy, the two would impose cap and trade and a carbon tax, pursue the “intent” of the Green New Deal, and ban fracking as rapidly as possible -- killing hundreds of thousands of jobs, increasing electricity and gas prices on households throughout the state, and undercutting America’s energy independence.
Employer health coverage? Gone. As MJ said, “single payer is the future” -- music to the ears of Medicare for All’s co-sponsor, Harris.
Both candidates are comfortable standing by while cities defund and “reimagine” the police. And a Harris-Hegar duo would raise taxes significantly by rolling back the 2017 tax cuts and raising the payroll tax -- creating even greater financial hardship for families and our economy as we work to dig out of a recession.
ENERGY
ANTI-OIL ATTACKS
Hegar And Harris Agree: They Both Attack The Oil Industry
Speaking To Reporters This Week, Hegar Refused To Criticize Or Condemn Vice President Biden’s Comments That Pledged To Transition Away From The Oil Industry. QUESTION: “MJ, Lizzie Fletcher said those Biden comments failed to address the complexity of the situation in Texas. Do you agree with that – even if you agree with the sentiment he was expressing, he was maybe a little too flippant with those comments?” HEGAR: “I gotta be honest with you, I’m not really paying attention that closely to the national stage. I’m talking to energy workers, I’m paying attention to my –” QUESTION: “Well, Lizzie Fletcher represents Houston.” HEGAR: “Year, I understand that. But, you know, maybe she was, I don’t know. I can’t speak for Lizzie and I can’t speak for Biden. I can just pseak for me and my, you know, business acumen. My executive MBA tells me we need to lean in to disruptive innovative technology when an industry is dominating and then technology comes along that transitions that energy into the next chapter. You’ve got to get onboard or you’re gonna get left behind.” (Patrick Svitek, Twitter, 10/27/20)
* Hegar Previously Criticized Texas’ History Of “Leading In All The Wrong Places,” Naming The Oil Industry And Likening It To “Gun Violence” And “Lack Of Health Care.” HEGAR: “I don't know about y’all—and I keep saying this—I feel like the whole world is watching what's happening in Texas right now. And they're paying attention, and we are the biggest battleground state in the country. And, you know, they look at us and for so long they've seen a low voter turnout state, they've seen we're leading in all the wrong places, in lack of health care, and gun violence, and the oil industry. And now they see people, they see the results of what we've been working so hard for and the momentum and the excitement across the state.” (MJ Hegar, Remarks At Virtual Northeast Tarrant County Democrats Brunch, 8/29/20; 16:13-16:47)
As A Presidential Candidate, Harris Pledged To “Convene A Meeting Of Major Emitters” To Engage In The “First-Ever Global Negotiation Of The Cooperative Managed Decline Of Fossil Fuel Production.” “As a follow up to the G7 meeting being hosted by the Trump Administration in 2020, and the G20 meeting to be hosted by Saudi Arabia in that same year, Kamala will propose and convene a meeting of major emitters in early 2021, focusing on climate change and the global economy. The meeting will focus on renewed commitments to fossil-fuel subsidy phase out and the first-ever global negotiation of the cooperative managed decline of fossil fuel production.” (“A Climate Plan For The People,” Kamala Harris For The People, Archived 4/17/20)
The Biden-Harris Ticket Has Promised To “Transition From The Oil Industry.” WELKER: “OK, I have one final question—"" TRUMP: “Would you close down the-- Would you close down the oil industry?” BIDEN: “I would transition from the oil industry. Yes.” TRUMP: “Oh, transition.” BIDEN: “It is a big statement because I would stop—"" WELKER: “Why would you do that?” BIDEN: “Because the oil industry significantly — but here's the deal —"" TRUMP: “That’s a big statement.” BIDEN: “Well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time. Over time. And I’d stop giving to the oil industry-- I’d stop giving them federal subsidies. You won't give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind. Why are we giving it to the oil industry?” (Vice President Joe Biden, Remarks At Presidential Debate, 10/22/20; 1:53:04-1:54:05)
CARBON TAX
Hegar And Harris Agree: They Both Want A Job-Destroying Carbon Tax
Hegar In August 2020: “I Stand With The League Of Conservation Voters And The Sierra Club, Who Support A Carbon Tax…” “If Biden wins, and if you’re in the Senate, it’s pretty likely that there’s going to be climate legislation. I think it’s widely agreed among economists and others that meaningful climate legislation will mean, in some form or another, a carbon tax. Will you support that? You know, I stand with the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, who support a carbon tax but also understand that it needs to be done in a way that doesn’t just pass the burden on to the middle class and to economically disadvantaged areas that are going to have to pay more for gasoline and for milk and for transportation and things like that.” (Jeff Goodell, “Is Texas Ready For A Democratic Senator? MJ Hegar Thinks So,” Rolling Stone, 8/14/20)
Sen. Kamala Harris Has Supported A Carbon Tax. “Other candidates who say they would support a carbon tax include Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren; former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former housing secretary Julian Castro; and California Sen. Kamala Harris.” (Emma Newburger, “‘Hit Them Where It Hurts’: Several 2020 Democrats Want A Carbon Tax On Corporations,” CNBC, 9/20/19)
* Harris’s Climate Plan: “A Climate Pollution Fee Can Play An Important Role As One Of Several Interrelated Policies To Reduce Emissions And Hold Polluters Accountable.” “Harris is no longer running for president. ‘A climate pollution fee can play an important role as one of several interrelated policies to reduce emissions and hold polluters accountable,’ Harris's climate plan said. ‘As Governor Inslee noted, a price on pollution is not a silver bullet, but by placing a progressively increasing fee as far upstream as possible, we can drive down pollution while raising government revenues that can be used to address the harms of greenhouse gas emissions. However, history shows us that reliance on market mechanisms alone can often leave communities behind. That’s why [Harris] will involve frontline communities in the fee development process, and would ensure that the fee revenues are invested back into those communities to improve environmental conditions and local economic development.’” (The Washington Post Website, Accessed 10/27/20)
CAP & TRADE
Hegar And Harris Agree: They Both Have Defended A Cap And Trade System
On A February 2020 Questionnaire, Hegar Said She Supported A Cap And Trade System For Carbon. QUESTION: “Would you support a cap-and-trade plan in an effort to reduce carbon emissions?” ANSWER: “Yes. Climate change is the greatest threat to the health and safety of our communities, the world we are leaving for the next generation and our national security. We must set aggressive goals for the expansion of clean, renewable energy, and invest in clean energy manufacturing and sustainable transportation. Texas has the opportunity to be America’s leader in wind and solar energy, and we should use our natural, renewable resources to create jobs in our state.” (Matthew Watkins, Darla Cameron And Anna Novak, “How Are The Top Democratic U.S. Senate Candidates In Texas Different? We Asked Them 11 Questions To Find Out.,” Texas Tribune, 2/12/20)
As California AG, Harris Defended The State’s Cap-And-Trade Program And The EPA’s Clean Power Plan. “Kamala Harris has dedicated her career to public service and fighting for justice. As California attorney general, Harris has defended key environmental laws, including California’s cap and trade program and the EPA’s Clean Power Plan. During her tenure, California led the nation in developing innovative measures to fight climate change. Harris was elected attorney general in 2010 and previously served as district attorney of San Francisco. Harris will work to bring California’s ambitious environmental leadership to the U.S. Senate. She will make it a priority to pass comprehensive legislation to address climate change and continue to grow California’s clean energy economy. Harris will also work to develop solutions to mitigate the effects of the drought in California and protect California’s majestic public lands and natural treasures.” (League Of Conservation Voters Website, Accessed 10/27/20)
GREEN NEW DEAL
The Hegar-Harris Position On The Green New Deal: It’s Complicated
In 2020, Hegar Has Said She Supports “The Intent” Of The Green New Deal, Noting The Need For “A Course Of Action On Climate Change.” “Hegar said she is not on board with the Green New Deal and never mentioned it during a recent 45-minute online environmental town hall with supporters. ‘I support the intent. I think we need a course of action on climate change; I don't support the Green New Deal specifically,’ she said. ‘It politicizes the most important issue facing our kids, which is climate changes, and I would like to sever the politics away from it as much as possible and build a broad bipartisan coalition.’ Hegar, who prefers talking about clean energy investments rather than climate regulations, concedes she is not an expert on environmental issues and said she would work on proposals with groups like LCV and the Sierra Club.” (George Cahlink, “Texas Senate Fight Offers Dueling Visions Of Energy's Future,” E&E News, 9/30/20)
“Ms. Harris Was An Original Co-Sponsor Of The Green New Deal, A Plan To Curb Planet-Warming Greenhouse Gas Emissions While Also Addressing Economic Inequality.” “But in other ways she has been leading. Ms. Harris was an original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, a plan to curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions while also addressing economic inequality. She has called for abolishing the filibuster if Republicans stand in the way of passing climate change legislation. She also favors a ban on fracking, a position that could put her at odds with Mr. Biden, who has called for a ban on new leases on federal lands but stopped short of calling for a comprehensive ban. President Trump’s campaign on Tuesday criticized Ms. Harris’ position on fracking as well as her support for the Green New Deal, saying both positions will lead to ‘economic catastrophe in natural gas states like Pennsylvania.’” (Lisa Friedman, “With The Biden-Harris Ticket, Environmental Justice Is A Focus,” The New York Times, 8/12/20)
HEALTH CARE
MEDICARE FOR ALL
Hegar And Harris Agree: Single-Payer Would Be “Great”
Hegar In 2018: “I Think A ‘Medicare For All’ Model Could Be Great…” EVAN SMITH: “This year ‘Medicare for All’ is a bit of a bauble on the charm bracelet for Democratic candidates. It is a test of your progressiveness as a candidate running for office. Are you for ‘Medicare for All’ or not?” HEGAR: “So, I have been the recipient of multiple single-player models.” SMITH: “You know government health care, right?” HEGAR: “I certainly do.” SMITH: “You have been the recipient of government health care.” HEGAR: “I have been the recipient of one called TRICARE, which is actually very similar to Medicare, and my mom is on Medicare now and I think it’s a great program. I think a ‘Medicare for All’ model could be great, but I’m also pragmatic and I’m fiscally responsible. I want to know how we’re going to pay for it. I also do think, we’re actually already paying for it, just not with taxes but with high health care costs and with people who are getting primary care in emergency rooms.” (MJ Hegar, Remarks At Texas Tribune CD-31 Conversation, 9/13/18; 49:20)
* Hegar: “I Think That Single-Payer Is The Future Of Our Health Care System…” MODERATOR: “Would you support a single payer health system in the United States. Yes or no? This is from someone named Joseph.” HEGAR: “The answer is yes. I think that single-payer is the future of our health care system, like it is in most industrialized countries. However, I think we need to focus on the right single-payer model. I myself have been the recipient of two single-payer models: One that worked really well and one that did not work. So I am committed to – I think we need to hold our candidates to a higher standard than just asking yes-or-no.” (MJ Hegar, Remarks To Texas Tribune, 3/21/18, 8:26–10:00)
Sen. Kamala Harris Was A Cosponsor On Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare For All Plan And Offered Her Own Version Of A Medicare For All Plan While Running For President. “California Sen. Kamala Harris has released a health care plan just in time for the second Democratic debate, offering a role for private insurance in a ‘Medicare for All’ system and outlining new taxes to pay for it. The plan comes after months of questions about whether she supports scrapping private insurance — and as former Vice President Joe Biden appears to be gearing up to attack her at the upcoming debate on her support for Medicare for All. To review, Bernie Sanders' single-payer health plan is called ‘Medicare for All,’ and Kamala Harris is a co-sponsor on that plan (along with several other presidential candidates, including New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren). His plan would cover all Americans with a government-administered health care plan.” (Danielle Kurtzleben, “Kamala Harris Releases 'Medicare For All' Plan With A Role For Private Insurers,” NPR, 7/29/19)
* Harris Raised Her Hand At A 2019 Debate In Favor Of Eliminating Private Insurance And Said At A CNN Town Hall She Would Support Eliminating All Private Health Insurance. “On the debate stage Thursday, Senator Kamala Harris raised her hand, seemingly in support of a government insurance proposal that would eliminate employer insurance. On Friday, she said she had misunderstood the question. The wording of the question left room for confusion, but Ms. Harris also has a history of making conflicting statements on the issue. In a CNN town hall in January, she said she’d favor eliminating all private health insurance. The next day, her campaign walked it back. A single-payer health plan requires people with other forms of comprehensive health insurance to switch. That is a politically risky position. Some Democrats have hedged by backing more gradual, optional expansions of public coverage. Others have decided that they can persuade voters that the advantages outweigh the disruption. Ms. Harris, so far, hasn’t chosen either one.” (Margot Sanger-Katz, “Where Is Kamala Harris On Medicare For All Vs. Private Insurance?,” The New York Times, 6/28/19)
POLICE
FUNDING
Hegar And Harris Agree: Funding Should Be Examined To Secure Police Reforms
When Asked About The Movement To Defund Police Departments, Hegar Said She Would Consider Using Funding As A Means Of Securing Policing Reforms. HOST: “Sen. Bernie Sanders last week tweeted that every police department that violates the civil rights of an individual should be stripped of federal funding. If you’re in the Senate, you may have to consider such legislation. Do you agree with Sen. Sanders?” … HEGAR: “Funding is definitely one of the tools we should be considering using. However, as someone who has been granted the authority to use deadly force when I was in the military as a combat-search-and-rescue helicopter pilot, as you know Gromer, when we were shot down and surrounded by 150 enemy fighters, we got everybody out alive and I was very cognizant of the fact that we had the authority to use deadly force. So I sympathize. But at the same time, the standards are so high for when we can pull the trigger in the military. I would like to see a similar standard in our police force. And I am dedicated to supporting the leaders within the law enforcement community who want to see that same transparency and accountability.” (MJ Hegar, Remarks At Democratic Senate Runoff Debate, 6/6/20; 10:30-12:05)
Hegar Has Said She Supports Police Reform “Proposals That Are Outlined In Places Like Campaign Zero.” “The conversation about climate is also a conversation about racial justice, environmental justice. And that leads into the other big thing that happened since you declared your candidacy, which is the Black Lives Matter movement and the killing of George Floyd, who was from Houston. How has this changed your candidacy and your politics? I’ve been talking about the need for reforms in policing [and] criminal-justice reform for years, like so many people have. And I think what’s different now is that our calls for reform will finally not fall on deaf ears. I think that this election is really our opportunity to be heard loud and clear. Every day, I am profoundly and deeply aware that I’m asking to represent folks across Texas who have been let down and sold out by a system, and by the people, by the way, who have been holding up that system, that refuses to enact the reforms that will make a difference in our communities. I support proposals that are outlined in places like Campaign Zero, that include ending for-profit policing practices and ensuring that police departments are a part of and representative of their communities. But I also think that we need to support leaders in the criminal justice system and in the police who want transparency and reform.” (Jeff Goodell, “Is Texas Ready For A Democratic Senator? MJ Hegar Thinks So,” Rolling Stone, 8/14/20)
* Campaign Zero Has Called For De-Prioritizing Of “Minor” Offenses, Including Disorderly Conduct, Trespassing, And Prostitution. “End Policing of Minor ‘Broken Windows’ Offenses The following activities do not threaten public safety and are often used to police black communities. Decriminalize these activities or de-prioritize their enforcement: Consumption of Alcohol on Streets Marijuana Possession Disorderly Conduct Trespassing Loitering Disturbing the Peace (including Loud Music) Spitting Jaywalking Bicycling on the Sidewalk Prostitution” (Campaign Zero Website, Accessed 7/21/20)
* Campaign Zero’s “8 Can’t Wait” Website Has Listed Among Its Goals: “Divest From Police” And “Fully Defund Police.” (8 Can’t Wait Website, Archived 7/21/20)
During An Appearance On “The View,” Sen. Kamala Harris Spoke Of “Reimagining How We Do Public Safety In America.” “During this summer of tear gas and turmoil, Kamala Harris has not been quiet. On ‘The View,’ the California senator spoke about ‘reimagining how we do public safety in America.’ On the Senate floor, she sparred with Rand Paul after the Kentucky Republican blocked a bill to make lynching a federal crime, and she is among the Democrats sponsoring policing legislation that would ban choke holds, racial profiling and no-knock warrants.” (Danny Hakim, Stephanie Saul and Richard A. Oppel Jr., “‘Top Cop’ Kamala Harris’s Record Of Policing The Police,” The New York Times, 8/9/20)
* In A “Good Morning America” Interview On Policing Reforms, Harris Said We Have To “Re-Examine What We're Doing With American Taxpayer Dollars And Ask The Question: Are We Getting The Right Return On Our Investment?” “Though Mayor Eric Garcetti has received significant backlash over his proposal to redirect funds earmarked for Los Angeles' police force, California Sen. Kamala Harris is speaking out in favor of the idea. Garcetti's proposal would invest some $250 million into health care, jobs and ‘healing’ aimed largely at the black community. The union representing LAPD officers fired back at the mayor, labeling him ‘unstable’ and accusing him of political pandering after he referred to ‘killers’ in remarks about the proposed spending change. In an interview on ‘Good Morning America,’ Harris voiced her support for investing in communities, noting that many American cities spend over one-third of their entire budget on policing, while defunding public schools. ‘We've got to re-examine what we're doing with American taxpayer dollars and ask the question: are we getting the right return on our investment? Are we actually creating healthy and safe communities?,’ she said. ‘That's a legitimate conversation and it requires a really critical evaluation. I applaud Eric Garcetti for doing what he's done.’” (“Sen. Kamala Harris Voices Support Of LA Mayor Garcetti's Call For Police Reform, Budget Cuts,” ABC 7, 6/9/20)
TAXES
INCOME TAXES
Hegar And Harris Agree: “Walk Back The Tax Reform” And Raise Taxes On Individuals And Job Creators
Hegar In 2020: “We’ve Got To Walk Back The Tax Reform – The Tax Scam.” HEGAR: “You know, we’ve got to walk back the tax reform – the tax scam. It was not a middle-class miracle. I am fighting for the middle class. I believe we’re leaving the lower middle class completely out. We have programs that help people in poverty. The upper middle class is doing okay. We’re leaving out this group of people.” (MJ Hegar, Remarks At A Campaign Event, San Antonio, TX, 2/19/20; 15:40-16:05)
As A Presidential Candidate, Harris Pledged To “Reverse” The GOP Tax Reform And Raise Taxes On Individuals And Job Creators. “But a much higher-profile priority for Harris is the reversal of the GOP-backed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act decreases in tax rates for businesses and rich Americans. ‘Much like Biden, she’s an advocate of higher taxes on businesses and higher-income, wealthy households,’ Zandi said. The platform laid out on Harris’s website promised to ‘reverse President Donald Trump’s trillion-dollar tax cut for big corporations and the top 1 percent.’ Those funds would go toward one of her signature policy initiatives: a refundable tax credit that would effectively function as a big expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit.” (Martha C. White, “Kamala Harris’ Economic Policy: Roll Back Tax Cuts, Expand Health Care And Middle-Class Tax Breaks,” NBC News, 8/13/20)
SOCIAL SECURITY
Hegar And Harris Agree: Hike Payroll Taxes
Hegar Has Vowed To “Raise The Income Cap” On The Social Security Payroll Tax. PADILLA: “MJ, MJ, if you get to be the Senator, look about making sure that we raise the cap, spread the cap on Social Security. Some of those that are making enough money can pay the—” HEGAR: “The income cap. I agree with you completely, Tony. Thank you for bringing that up. We should have talked about that. Raise the income cap.” (MJ Hegar, Remarks At Social Security & Medicare Virtual Town Hall, 10/6/20; 37:25-37:45)
In 2019, Harris Co-Sponsored Bernie Sanders’ Bill To Remove Social Security’s Taxable Income Cap For Taxpayers Making More Than $250,000. “Today, U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) joined her colleagues to introduce legislation to expand Social Security benefits and strengthen the retirement program for generations to come. The legislation would increase benefits by about $1,342 a year for seniors now making less than $16,000 annually and increase cost-of-living adjustments by more accurately measuring the spending patterns of seniors… The bill would ensure that Social Security could pay every benefit owed to every eligible American for the next 52 years, according to the retirement system’s chief actuary. It would extend the program’s solvency by making the wealthiest 1.8 percent of Americans – those with incomes of more than $250,000 a year – pay the same rate into the retirement system as everyone else already pays. Current law caps the amount of income subject to payroll taxes at $132,900. In addition to Senator Harris, the bill is cosponsored by Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR).” (Sen. Kamala Harris, “Harris Joins Colleagues to Introduce Bill to Expand Social Security,” Press Release, 2/13/19)

Friends,
Since 1918, there have been nearly 200 failed attempts to make lynching a federal crime.
What you do now will determine if our next attempt fails again, or if we finally get it done. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Tim Scott have a bill that has strong bipartisan support. It would pass and be sitting on the President's desk to sign or veto -- but Mitch McConnell won't bring it to the floor for a vote. Yesterday, it took only one extremist Senator to block it.
This isn’t partisan. There are plenty of votes in both parties to pass this. That’s why Mitch McConnell won’t allow a vote. He wants it to fail for what is close to the 200th time.
Contact your Senator. Demand that a vote be held. Sign my petition and make your voice heard today >>
In this moment where we must come together as a country to meaningfully discuss steps toward ending centuries of systemic racism, what a horrible message the failure of this bill would be. Passing this bill is far from the only thing we must do to combat injustice and racism, but when we have an opportunity to right an obvious wrong with bipartisan support, we must seize it.
We cannot let Mitch McConnell stop what is so clearly the right thing to do.
Thank you.

Alex,
Today is the first day of early voting in Illinois, and I want to tell you about two Cook County candidates who could use your support in the final weeks of the Illinois primary:
Kim Foxx has taken crucial steps in her first term as Cook County State’s Attorney to reform our criminal justice system, declining to prosecute low-level offenders, and pursuing alternatives to prison, all while increasing resources to combat violent gun crimes.
Mike Cabonargi is running for Cook County Clerk of the Circuit Court and is committed to joining Kim in making our criminal justice system fair for everyone. Mike is a proven reformer who fought corruption and fraud as an attorney at the SEC, and I know firsthand that he’s the right person for the job.
Can you contribute $5 today to give Kim and Mike a critical final boost as early voting gets underway?
Illinois prisons are over capacity and our state spends millions of dollars incarcerating low-level offenders -- money that can be better spent on priorities like preventing crime and treating drug addiction.
We’ve made significant strides in the past year at the federal level to ensure fairer sentencing and reduce our incarceration rate. I’m glad to see Kim Foxx making similar progress in Cook County, and I’m eager to see her and Mike Cabonargi continue this important work going forward.
I’m proud to support Kim Foxx and Mike Cabonargi. Please join me in contributing $5 to their campaigns now to support them before Illinois’ primary.
Thank you,
Dick Durbin

Friend,
Did you see the latest?
Ilhan Omar attacked the law enforcement community yet again, this time going after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for doing their jobs and deporting dangerous illegal immigrants.
Well, ICE responded, noting that of the 39 illegal immigrants they deported, 36 of them were criminals, with crimes that include “murder, rape, domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, crimes against children, drug trafficking, and conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.”
So just to review. Law enforcement did their job to keep families safe from some of the most vile criminals… and Ilhan Omar attacked them.
We need to beat Ilhan Omar in November. With your help, we can get the job done.

838,"More recklessness from the radical leftist.
Friend,
At this point, nothing that Ilhan Omar does surprises me, no matter how reckless.
Apparently Ilhan Omar wasn’t satisfied with her attacks on law enforcement.
It’s clear now that her calls to defund the police – which have led to a spike in violent crime in Minneapolis – were just the tip of the iceberg.
And even her assault on our free markets and our entire American system of government were just a start.
Now, she wants a lawless Southern border. Just look at what she posted this weekend:
Make no mistake, the hard-working men and women of ICE protect every single American. Ilhan Omar’s recklessness will open our Southern border to human traffickers, drug smugglers, and MS-13 gang members, putting our lives at risk.
With your help, we’ll defeat Ilhan Omar this November.
It’s time to elect someone who will stand with law enforcement and ICE, someone who believes that America is the greatest nation on the face of the Earth.

Today is #GivingTuesday, a global day of good works and unity. It’s a day for people to come together and give to non-profits in response to the unprecedented need caused by the pandemic.
Chester and Berks Counties have not been spared by COVID-19. Local groups have been working hard to help people get through this crisis, but we still have a long way to go before life returns to normal. There are many organizations doing great work in our communities - too many to name them all. We put together a list of groups in Chester and Berks Counties, as examples, that need your help to continue to serve people affected during this extraordinary time.
Chester County
* Chester County Women’s Services: This group is providing crucial services to families and individuals – providing for children’s basic needs (food, diapers, formula, etc), helping with medical appointments, and providing other basic needs that arise.
* Friends Association for the Care and Protection of Children: Your gift will go directly to helping financially fragile families get through the crisis caused by COVID-19.
* Safe Harbor of Chester County: They offer shelter for men and women, along with meals, laundry access, and support services. They also provide a community lunch daily and a pop-up food pantry six days a week for the food insecure of the County.
* Crisis Victims Center of Chester County: This organization provides services to anyone who has found themselves in a dark situation as a victim of crime. They provide free counselling, victim advocacy, assistance with court hearings/interviews, and financial assistance for anyone who needs help in Chester County.
* Octorara Food Pantry: They provide food for those in need in the southern Chester County community. The need is heightened during this pandemic.
Berks County
* Hope Rescue Mission and the Lighthouse: Providing a place of refuge for the homeless in Berks County. They help people transition back into the community.
* Mercy Ministries: This organization provides Biblically-based peer counseling and support for individuals and families. They provide basic supplies (diapers, wipes, personal hygiene items) as well.
* Salvation Army: They are providing monetary assistance for food, rent, utilities, and medications as well as regular food distributions and homeless support services.
* New Journey Community Outreach: They offer a daily soup kitchen, weekly food pantry, and a weekly clothing handout for individuals and families in the Reading area.
* Olivet Boys and Girls Clubs: Sadly, they have had to close their after school programs but are working hard to provide Grab and Go Dinner and snacks at 8 locations, Monday through Friday, and Family Food Pantry Box giveaways weekly at 4 locations.
Please consider giving a small donation of money, goods, and / or your time. A gift to any of these in our area go a long way to helping others less fortunate.

Impeachment
Following the House vote on impeachment this Wednesday, I released the following statement. You can also find it on my website here.
""The impeachment of a duly-elected President of the United States is something to be undertaken under the most extreme circumstances. Since before President Trump was even sworn into office, Democrats have been advocating for impeachment. The first articles of impeachment were drafted in 2017, just a few months into the president's administration. Today, the Democrats finally voted for two articles of impeachment that include no crime, let alone anything approaching a 'high crime and misdemeanor.' Today, the Democrats have made a mockery of a grave Constitutional responsibility.
""When Chrissy Houlahan ran for Congress in 2018, she promised the voters that she would be different. Her campaign ads bemoaned the 'anger and partisanship' in Washington. She proclaimed herself to be a moderate voice. Over the past two months, she has revealed herself to be just another partisan Democrat, taking a role as a 'leader on impeachment' according to CNN.
""This is a sad day for America. It is a sad day for the voters of the 6th Congressional District who trusted Chrissy Houlahan to live up to her campaign promises. In the end, she turned out to be just another vote for Nancy Pelosi. Chrissy Houlahan needs to be defeated next November. That is what I intend to do.""
On Social Media
Last month we launched a ""Beyond the Bio"" series to help you get to know me as a person and how my unique background has shaped my deeply-held political beliefs.
Be sure to like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter, and find us on Instagram to keep up-to-date with the campaign and see the rest of the ""Beyond the Bio"" series.
In Case You Missed It
﻿When I launched this campaign in September, we released a short video to share why I was running for Congress and to showcase some of the important issues that must be addressed in this election.
I hope you will take a couple of minutes and view the video by clicking here.
I also released a video calling out Chrissy Houlahan. She ran as a so-called ""moderate,"" complaining that ""anger and partisanship"" were the reason Congress wasn't getting anything done. Now she's Nancy Pelosi's leader on impeachment... and Congress isn't getting anything done.

He repeatedly ignored Congress and claimed more power for himself under the Constitution. Despite this blatant ""usurpation of power"" as one representative put it, he had enough Senators in his pocket to acquit him when impeached.
""History repeats itself"" might sound like a cliche, but it is true. And we aren't talking about Trump, we are going further back to 1868. These were some of the many charges leveled against then President Andrew Johnson.
Johnson set our country's progress back during the critical time known as Reconstruction. But it was at precisely this time that Congress was able to pass the Tenure of Office Act,, and the 14th and 15th amendments. Like Johnson, Trump is suffering defeats at the Supreme Court too, just as Trump has done recently, on DACA, abortion restrictions and LGBTQ rights.
Important victories, to be sure, but there is so much more we need to accomplish.
That is why I am writing to you today. We KNOW Trump and Republicans are worried about losing control. NOW is the time to get to work to flip the Texas State House with five winnable seats right here in Tarrant County!
History repeats itself, until we decide to make history.
Please sign up today to write letters to unregistered Democrats, call them or donate to help pay for postage, databases, staff salaries and printing.
Help us, join us in getting as many democrats to the poll this November as possible so together, WE WILL MAKE HISTORY!

Stephen Daniel for Congress 2020
Alex,
This week, seven top aides to Attorney General Ken Paxton came forward to accuse him of serious crimes — including abuse of office and bribery.
This isn’t an isolated incident. The Texas GOP continue to abuse their positions of power for their own personal gain. I’m tired of it. Help us flip Texas Blue by donating $20.20 or whatever you can today >>>
Texans deserve leadership that will focus on prioritizing the people and taking corruption OUT of office. But time and again we see Republican leaders who put themselves first. They use their power to cater to big donors, line their own pockets, and serve the interests of the powerful and wealthy few.
Their time is up, y’all. Leaders like Ron Wright and Ken Paxton — who continue to put their wealthy donors first — have got to go. Let’s finally elect leaders that will lead with dignity and work for the people of Texas by flipping Texas Blue on November 3rd >>>

Our Democratic House Majority took swift, urgent, and lawful action to hold President Trump accountable for his abuses of power. Alex, the Senate must do the same.

845,"Joe Biden made his unsurprising announcement that Kamala Harris will be his Vice Presidential running mate.
Laura Loomer for Congress
Patriot,
Joe Biden made his unsurprising announcement that Kamala Harris will be his Vice Presidential running mate.
I’ve dealt with Kamala Harris and exposed her blatant political corruption back in 2017 as an investigative journalist.
Of course, the Mainstream Media didn’t run with the story at the time so let me tell you a bit about what I uncovered.
In October of 2016, Trump supporter and activist, Mark Feigin was arrested and charged by then California Attorney General Kamala Harris for making “criminal threats” and “annoying phone calls” to an Islamic Center.
It turns out, Feigin didn’t make the calls, but I found out who did, and I published the police interviews that took place with the real culprit.
Despite Mr. Feigin being TOTALLY cleared of the false accusations, Kamala wouldn’t stop and demanded he sign a plea agreement that required 5 years of formal probation, and community service that would be SUPERVISED BY A MUSLIM GROUP.
Kamala Harris also demanded that Mark Feigin denounce the “Alt-Right” even though he was never associated with it.
That’s right, Kamala Harris demanded a U.S. Citizen denounce beliefs after falsely charging him with a hate crime.
Kamala is the poster child of political corruption and with her elevation to the #2 most powerful Democrat in the nation, you can rest assured that AOC, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and every other power-hungry Democrat in Congress will emulate Kamala’s model to use the government against political adversaries.
And I plan on being in Congress in 2021 to stop them. Help me get there today.
We’re days away from Primary Day in Florida and my eyes are set on the General Election and meeting our fundraising goals to win in November.
We have $36,725 left to raise before Primary Day. Will you chip in $10 today and ask a friend to do the same?
Our General Election media blitz needs to be funded with a war chest to compete against my Democrat opponent and any amount you can donate will help us get there. Chip in $10, $20 or whatever you can afford.
Kamala Harris will be the new corrupt “attack dog” of the Left as Joe Biden can’t even string along a sentence and she’ll spawn a dozen wannabe’s in Congress who will be hell-bent on destroying or silencing any conservative who challenges them.
But they’ve tried that with me . . . for years.
They failed, I’m still here and they know that when they send their attack dogs after me, they’re the ones who get bitten.
Send me to Washington by donating today.
Thank you again for all that you do.

Laura Loomer for Congress
Patriot,
Four years ago today, ISIS terrorist Omar Mateen gunned down 49 people in the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Florida.
Following the terrorist attack, the media and Democrat politicians labeled it a hate crime against the LGBTQ community and immediately began the call to restrict our Second Amendment rights.
But their narrative was misleading.
After failing to gain entry to Disney World, Mateen’s original target, he chose Pulse nightclub as the location of his terrorist attack.
The Islamic terrorist was outraged by the killing of ISIS leader Abu Waheeb a month earlier, which is why he stormed the gay nightclub, massacring 49 people, holding others hostage, while pledging allegiance to ISIS.
But democrats still deny it was an act of Islamic terrorism to this day.
Ilhan Omar posted on Twitter, ""Let’s remember the attack for what it was: a hate crime against the LGBTQIA+ community.""
Just hours ago, Nancy Pelosi called it a ""shocking act of hatred.""
Other Democrats like my opponent Lois Frankel are refusing to admit this was an act of Islamic terrorism, and are instead attacking law abiding gun owners.
Islamic Terrorism doesn’t fit the narrative of Democrats in this critical election year. Their ""hate America"" agenda bolsters terrorists and some Democrats like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib work directly with groups that are officially designated as terrorist organizations. Ilhan Omar once advocated for nine men in her district who joined ISIS, asking a judge to lessen their sentencing.
This is why I’m headed to Washington. And I need your help to get there.
Help me honor the American lives lost to Islamic Terrorism by allowing me to actively fight against those who would go so far as to change the narrative to fit their agenda.
I have to go back to Ilhan Omar’s quote, ""Let’s remember the attack for what it was . . . ""
That’s a shameful, outrageous lie!
FOURTY-NINE lives were lost on this day four years ago. FOURTY-NINE men and women were stalked and many were shot at point blank range by an ISIS TERRORIST.
Let’s not forget the attack for what it was . . . ISLAMIC TERRORISM.
Help me get to Washington so that next year, on the fifth anniversary of this attack, I can remind Ilhan Omar and hand her the names of the men and women killed by an ISIS terrorist.
Thank you again for all that you do.

847,"Donald Trump has overturned a fair-housing rule.
Dana Balter for Congress
Friend,
Disgusting.
Disgusting is how I would describe Donald Trump’s most recent racist, divisive, and extreme rhetoric -- when he took to Twitter to boast about overturning an Obama-era rule created to combat housing discrimination.
Trump tweets: ""I am happy to inform all of the people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your [[URL REDACTED]] housing prices will go up based on the market, and crime will go down. I have rescinded the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. Enjoy!""
Here are the facts:
* The 1968 Fair Housing Act was created to prohibit discrimination based on race, color, national origin -- later including religion, sex, familial status, and disability.
* The 2015 Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) rule was created to combat modern-day segregation by requiring local governments to identify and address patterns of discrimination outlined in the Fair Housing Act.
* Now, Donald Trump is rolling back protections in our own communities and stoking the fires of hatred.
We cannot afford to move our country backward -- instead, we should listen to the diverse voices in our communities and take action to dismantle systemic racism and discrimination. Please sign our petition to tell Donald Trump to reverse course and re-enact the AFFH rule.
ADD YOUR NAME »
The divisiveness in his language -- shamelessly connecting criminal activity to low-income housing -- is repugnant.
American values mean equal opportunities; American values mean protections from discrimination; American values mean welcoming everyone regardless of who you are or where you come from.
But we have a president who wants to actively undermine policies and institutions that are used to combat racism and discrimination. And this is the man that my opponent, Congressman John Katko, endorses.
So we need to speak out against this blatant bigotry. We need to reaffirm the principle that everyone deserves a fair shot to succeed and share in prosperity and security -- our true American values.
Please join me and sign your name to support fair housing.
Onward,
Dana

848,"John Katko is shirking his responsibility in the face of an unprecedented assault against our democracy by Donald Trump.
Friend, we're just 80 days away from the biggest election of our lifetimes.
Not only must we defeat a racist, corrupt president who is using the executive branch to undermine our democratic institutions; we must hold accountable the lawmakers who had the opportunity to put their country first, but instead chose political expediency.
John Katko had a choice last year, when clear evidence of Trump's impeachable crimes was out in the open. He made the choice to vote against holding Trump accountable -- and then endorse him for re-election.
The recent public efforts by Donald Trump to sabotage the U.S. Postal Service and suppress mail-in voting are disgraceful, but they're not at all surprising in light of what we learned last year. Members of Congress -- like John Katko -- who supported Donald Trump then are responsible for what is happening now.

Friend,
After the horrific hate crime in Monsey where five people were stabbed at a rabbi’s home during Chanukah, I posted a series of tweets responding to the attacks and the rise of anti-Semitism in our country.
@dana_balter Pay attention. We know where this leads. My grandparents fled Austria because of where this leads. More than six million of us were slaughtered because of where this leads. 1/ 12:40 PM · Dec 29, 2019 Condemning this attack is not enough. Taking this opportunity to say “anti-Semitism is bad” or “hate has no place here” is not enough. Saying you “stand in solidarity” with your “Jewish brothers and sisters” is not enough.   2/Make no mistake, what happened in #Monsey isn't just because of a bad man with a machete. When the president uses historically anti-semetic language-like “America first” & fighting “globalists”-to frame his views & rile his base & you say nothing, you're helping this happen.  3/When the president says that Jews who didn’t vote for him are disloyal and you say nothing, you are helping this happen. When the president calls white nationalists chanting Nazi slogans “very fine people” and you say nothing, you are helping this happen.  4/Allies are not the people who mourn your tragedies with you. Allies are the people who take a stand, who use their power and their voices to speak up and speak out when it’s difficult, when it may cost them something but they do it anyway because it’s right. Be an ally.   5/5
On the one hand, the hateful responses I received didn't surprise me because I'm a Jewish woman in the United States of America -- this is not my first experience of anti-Semitism.
On the other hand, they shocked me because they were so vile and so virulent, and a very sad indicator of serious and widespread trends we need to confront in our country. We have to acknowledge this is happening. This is not an isolated incident.
We have a president who regularly spews this kind of hatred while praising other people who do the same. He is actively fostering an environment of hate.
History has shown us over and over and over again that when you foster an environment where these kinds of verbal and physical assaults are not only accepted but are excused, we end up in very serious trouble.

Dana Balter for Congress
Team,
As Donald Trump has continued his assault on the rule of law, the response from John Katko has been revealing.
When Trump interfered in the Roger Stone case? Crickets. When Trump commuted Rod Blagojevich, the former governor of Illinois who was convicted of a pay-to-play scheme involving a U.S. Senate seat? Crickets. When Trump said, ""I am the chief law enforcement officer""? Crickets.
As a former federal prosecutor, Katko knows how dangerous this is for democracy. If only he would show an ounce of the courage of the four DOJ prosecutors who resigned after Trump got involved in the Stone case. Or the more than 2000 former DOJ officials who called on Attorney General Bill Barr to resign.
Here's the fact of the matter: when Katko and his Republican colleagues refused to hold Trump accountable for his impeachable crimes, they gave a green light for further abuses of power. So if we're going to fight Trump's corruption, we need to defeat the members of Congress who've quietly (or loudly) condoned it.
That's why I'm asking for your help today. Can you donate $10 to help us stay on track for our critical February goal? We need to raise $10,442 more by the end of the month.

Last night, President Trump made blatantly racist comments on Fox News attacking low-income families and — once again — Cory himself:
""They were trying to destroy the suburban beautiful [[URL REDACTED]] want low income housing and with that comes a lot of other problems including crime. If Biden gets in... you know who's going to be in charge of it? Cory Booker — that's going to be nice...""
Trump is literally trying to scare suburban voters by the mere thought of low-income families moving into — or in his words, bringing crime to — their neighborhood. That's about as ugly as it gets.
This country has a deeply painful history of housing discrimination. In 1969, Cory's own parents relied on the help of a white couple posing as them in order to purchase their home in what was a predominantly white suburban New Jersey neighborhood. Their ability to purchase that home forever impacted Cory's life in a positive way, but not every family has that opportunity.
This president is using racist and hateful language to rally up his base and create fear. It's not only divisive, it's dangerous.

Team, did you read Cory's message last week about the new bill he introduced?
In direct response to the nationwide calls for police reform and justice for Black lives, Cory introduced the Justice in Policing Act, which would ban chokeholds, create a national database of police misconduct, and much more.
Our country has gone far too long without any significant reform to address the growing epidemic of police violence against Black Americans. Join Cory in calling for change by urging the Senate to pass his bill today.
ADD YOUR NAME
Friend,
Since the tragic murder of George Floyd at the hands of police, the calls for justice have been loud and clear. Now is the time for policy change and legislative action.
That's why I'm a partner in the effort, along with Kamala Harris and Democratic Congressional leaders, to introduce the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, a set of comprehensive reforms that will create stronger systems of transparency and accountability while bringing needed reform to police departments across the country.
If you're ready for transformative change to America's policing, add your name right now to become a co-sponsor of this new legislation.
ADD YOUR NAME
As millions of Americans have continued to rise up and unite for justice in every corner of the country, I've spent the past few weeks working closely with Senator Harris as well as the Congressional Black Caucus to develop legislation that will address the unchecked bias and lack of accountability in our nation's police departments.
This bill is just the first step to stopping the gut-wrenching injustices that have taken the lives of too many Black Americans for decades on end.
It aims to shine a light on abuse and corruption by creating a federal database of police misconduct, and strengthening the consequences for such actions by ending the ""qualified immunity"" that has long protected police officers from being held accountable for violating a person's rights.
It would also prevent the escalation and brutality that killed George Floyd and Breonna Taylor by prohibiting chokeholds, banning no-knock warrants in drug cases, and putting an end to racial and religious profiling.
And finally, at long last, lynching would become a federal crime.
It's been decades since legislation to reform policing like this has been introduced in Washington, and quite frankly it's long overdue. Ending systemic racism will not happen overnight or with one bill, but through this legislation, we can make real progress.
Join me in supporting the passage of these critical police reforms by adding your name now.
ADD YOUR NAME
Together, let's rise and reform the system so we can end the institutionalized violence against Black lives in America.

We can’t believe it, but President Trump just attacked Cory AGAIN team — the third time in a matter of a week.
Last night at his political rally in Iowa — which defied CDC guidance and put hundreds of people at risk in the middle of a pandemic — Trump came for Cory by saying “stupid people like Cory Booker,"" and then mocked Newark, New Jersey.
Clearly Trump is reaching here, given the fact that Cory is a Rhodes Scholar who loves the city of Newark where he successfully ushered in an economic boom, drove down crime, and rooted out corruption during his tenure as Mayor.
Let’s show Trump once again that the people have Cory’s back, especially now that we’re only 19 days away from Election Day. Pitch in $10 or more to support Cory’s re-election and efforts to flip the Senate in less than three weeks:

Today is Juneteenth. President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation to declare an end to the vile institution of slavery in America in 1862. But, many enslaved people were still held captive even after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed.
On June 19, 1865, the word of freedom finally reached a community of enslaved people in Galveston, Texas. It was on that day that Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, arrived in Galveston to declare freedom for the people who were still enslaved. It had taken nearly two and a half years for this news to travel to the hundreds of thousands of enslaved people still remaining in Texas.
The celebration of rejoice and reunion that followed is one we continue to this day.
On this Juneteenth, I am taking time to remember our history, to rejoice in the progress we have made and reflect on the enormity of the work we have left to do.
The truth is that even once Black Americans were emancipated, our ancestors continued to face enormous barriers: to live free from racism and racialized violence, to work with dignity, to vote, to build wealth and economic security for themselves and for future generations.
Today, as those barriers remain, so must our commitment to justice.
That is why I am working to push Congress to act to take the transformative steps needed to address the hate and systemic racism that is still so deeply rooted in our laws and institutions. We must finally make lynching a federal crime, reform our criminal justice system, and critically, intervene to create more transparent and accountable police departments.
The injustices we must confront are interrelated: from environmental injustice that disproportionately affects Black Americans to disparities in health access and outcomes to the staggering racial wealth gap that disadvantages Black families. We have so much work to do.
Today, as I honor the sacrifices made by my ancestors and rejoice in their grace and relentless hope for this country, I renew my commitment to fighting for true justice and equality for all.
I hope you will join me.

Friend,
Since the tragic murder of George Floyd at the hands of police, the calls for justice have been loud and clear. Now is the time for policy change and legislative action.
That's why I'm a partner in the effort, along with Kamala Harris and Democratic Congressional leaders, to introduce the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, a set of comprehensive reforms that will create stronger systems of transparency and accountability while bringing needed reform to police departments across the country.
If you're ready for transformative change to America's policing, add your name right now to become a co-sponsor of this new legislation.
ADD YOUR NAME
As millions of Americans have continued to rise up and unite for justice in every corner of the country, I've spent the past few weeks working closely with Senator Harris as well as the Congressional Black Caucus to develop legislation that will address the unchecked bias and lack of accountability in our nation's police departments.
This bill is just the first step to stopping the gut-wrenching injustices that have taken the lives of too many Black Americans for decades on end.
It aims to shine a light on abuse and corruption by creating a federal database of police misconduct, and strengthening the consequences for such actions by ending the ""qualified immunity"" that has long protected police officers from being held accountable for violating a person's rights.
It would also prevent the escalation and brutality that killed George Floyd and Breonna Taylor by prohibiting chokeholds, banning no-knock warrants in drug cases, and putting an end to racial and religious profiling.
And finally, at long last, lynching would become a federal crime.
It's been decades since legislation to reform policing like this has been introduced in Washington, and quite frankly it's long overdue. Ending systemic racism will not happen overnight or with one bill, but through this legislation, we can make real progress.
Join me in supporting the passage of these critical police reforms by adding your name now.
ADD YOUR NAME
Together, let's rise and reform the system so we can end the institutionalized violence against Black lives in America.
– Cory

# Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for Congress
Alex, right-wing media outlets are at it again. Whenever AOC speaks about systematic injustice, they ramp up their efforts to silence her. But this time, their outrage is truly absurd.
On a recent livestream, AOC talked about the connection between poverty and crime – a fact that any expert on the subject would agree with. But right wing pundits lost it, accusing her of making excuses for violent crime.
Their motivation is transparent. They couldn’t defeat AOC by donating to a corporate primary challenger, so now they’re trying to bully our movement into silence. We won’t let that happen. Will you donate $3 to help us fight back against these right-wing attacks?
Donate $3
A $6 billion budget for the NYPD has done nothing to stop the spike in crime that we’ve seen in NYC. Meanwhile, countless folks from across the city still haven’t received their economic stimulus checks. Tens of thousands of New Yorkers are facing eviction. One in six children in NYC public schools is homeless.
Those are the facts. Crime is a symptom of a society that neglects its most marginalized people, and alleviating that problem requires the passage of critical progressive policies that AOC has fought for since day one. But that reality runs counter to the narrative of too many right-wing politicians who just want to increase police funding and decrease accountability.
So they’re doing everything they can to delegitimize us and shut out our message. Help us fight back by donating $3 to bolster this movement right now.
Thanks for your support,
Team AOC

859,"Dear Alex,
I am Sandy Smith, the Republican nominee for Congress in North Carolina’s newly redrawn 1st Congressional district.
I am a patriot who has had it with unconstitutional lockdown orders, given by liberal Trump-hating socialist Democrats who are trying to tank the economy to hurt the President politically.
Mean-spirited left-wing partisan hack governors have been punishing ordinary citizens all across the country, for the ""crime"" of trying to feed their families and avoid losing their businesses.
Image
In Michigan, their Democrat Governor is persecuting small businesses like a 77-year old barber:
State regulators on Wednesday suspended the license of a 77-year-old Michigan barber who insisted on cutting hair despite an order to stay closed during the coronavirus pandemic.
Karl Manke has pledged to keep his shop open “until Jesus comes.” A judge declined the state’s request to shut down his shop Monday without first holding a hearing. Regulators took a different path by suspending his barber license and his shop license.
In Oregon, their governor sent Child Protective Services to harass a small business owner who tried to open in defiance of their Democrat governor's order:
Oregon Occupational Safety and Health issued a $14,000 fine to Lindsey Graham, owner of Glamor Salon in Salem, for reopening her salon May 5 in defiance of Gov. Kate Brown's stay-home order.
""I'm being threatened and intimidated and bullied daily by the government,"" Graham said during a press conference Friday. ""I'm sad that I can drive 20 minutes down the freeway, and that person's job as a hairstylist is essential, according to Kate Brown. But my job, 20 minutes up the street, is nonessential.""
""I don't want anyone to get sick. I know you guys don't want anyone to get sick,"" Graham said. ""But I also don't want to go bankrupt and lose everything I worked for and neither do you.""
She also claimed that Child Protective Services had visited her house and questioned her child. ""I've never expected such a violent, aggressive, vindictive thing could ever be done to me or my family,"" she said, ""because I'm trying to earn a living, because I'm trying to work.""
Here in North Carolina, we have another one of these abusive governors, Roy Cooper.
This guy is every bit the tinpot dictator that the governors of Michigan and Oregon are. You may recall that the Republican National Convention (which I will attend as a Trump delegate!) is in Charlotte, NC in August:
President Donald Trump this week accused North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper of “playing politics” with reopening the state, and said it would be “bad for them” if the state were to delay the start of the Republican National Convention in Charlotte.
“No, no,” Trump replied. “We’ll have a convention. I’m a traditionalist, but we’ll have to see, like everything else, but I think we’ll be in good shape by that time. We have a great state, North Carolina, that’s been very, very good.
“Although, it’s got a Democrat governor, so we have to be a little bit careful. It’s got a Democrat governor, so we have to be a little bit careful with that, because they’re playing politics. They’re playing politics, as you know, by delaying the openings. ... To me that’s politics. They think it’s a bad thing for me if they delay the opening. I think it’s bad for them. And you have people protesting outside, and those people like Trump.”
Image
Our hyper-partisan governor would cancel the RNC if he thought he could get away with it. That's how these tyrannical Democrat governors roll. I have never met anyone so lost in what he is doing. A lost socialist is very very dangerous because you combine incompetence with bad left wing policy at the same time.
I've had it with these people. It is now abundantly clear that their motives were NEVER to keep anyone safe or healthy. It's to accumulate power for themselves, punish those who work for a living to support their families, and tank the economy for the election.
I am disgusted and shocked by their actions. No red-blooded American should ever stand for tyranny, and no one should stand for political-fueled retributions, either.
If you are proud of our president, as I am, I need YOUR help urgently to defeat my high-level radical socialist Democrat opponent and retake this swing seat!
Let's send a message to the Socialist NC governor. Let's show these tyrants that they can't get away with this.
I am proud of those who are standing to fight with me. I have already been endorsed by Congressman Mark Walker, Congressman Ted Budd, and Congressman Mark Meadows. Here is a picture of me and Mark Meadows. Congressman Meadows used to be Chairman of the Freedom Caucus, and now he is the President Trump’s Chief of Staff in the White House. He “proudly endorsed” me shortly before his promotion, which I was so honored!
Image
President Trump has accomplished so much with constant pushback from the socialists, like these governors. Imagine what he can do with a supportive Congress!
It is so crucial that we take advantage of every chance we have to flip a swing district \- which North Carolina’s First District now is! They just redrew the map and took away a bunch of Democrat voters, making this district MUCH more competitive.
But this year, this district turned into a swing district. Half of the district has never been represented by Butterfield. They don’t know him, and they are Republicans!
Will you help me beat Butterfield and deprive Nancy Pelosi of a reliable vote? I need you to send $15, $35, or $250 right now so that I can meet my goal by the end of this month. This deadline is so critical, and I have no time to lose.
I will NEVER vote with Nancy Pelosi! She and her insane leftist agenda can pound sand!
Can you help me take this swing district back, with your best and immediate contribution of $15, $35, or $250? Taking out one of Pelosi’s leading lieutenants would be a major, crippling blow to the socialist anti-American left and to Nancy Pelosi’s agenda. Please rush back your supporting contribution today. Thank you.
G.K. Butterfield is a leftist extremist, not a patriot, but to replace him I really need your help. I appreciate you and thank you.

860,"Dear Alex,
I am Sandy Smith, the Republican nominee for Congress in North Carolina’s newly redrawn 1st Congressional district.
As you may know, I come from a military family- including my husband and my children. My family has a legacy of service to keeping the American people safe.
Let me be clear: those who seek to riot and burn, then to blame our brave police for their violence and mistakes, CANNOT be allowed to ""defund the police""!
These riots were never ""peaceful protests"". They were grotesquely violent: over 150 killed, over 20 cops killed, hundreds of businesses and homes burned.
Image
Three black cops and several black civilians were murdered by the rioters, meaning that it was likely never about ""black lives matter"" in the first place.
Of course, it was never just protesters. Antifa, foreign actors and what Bill Barr called a ""witch's brew"" of bad actors drove the violence, arson and murder.
The federal officials gathered with Mr. Barr said they’re tracking the violence nationwide, pointing to investigations into more than 800 arsons and 76 explosive devices at protests. They described the violent actors behind them, from Antifa to the far-right Boogaloo movement.
Mr. Barr called it a “witch’s brew,” and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said different groups are involved in different cities.
Underpinning some of the dissension are the same foreign actors who have tried to meddle in American politics in the past, the officials said — though they didn’t name specific countries nor say exactly what they’ve seen.
Mr. Barr said they are “playing all sides to exacerbate the violence.”
“I believe we have evidence that some foreign hackers and groups associated with foreign governments are focused on this particular situation we have here and exacerbate it every way they can,” he said.
So, possibly Russians or Iranians or ISIS are stirring up a revolution on our streets from young extreme leftists who are murdering cops.
But actually, it's worse than that.
Antifa may be useful idiots to the Russians, but President Trump is not fooled. He is taking on that threat head on!
Image
Sensing weakness in Democrat politicians like New York's DeBlasio, or Chicago's Lightfoot, these Antifa rioters have begun to list demands.... starting with defunding- or eliminating- the police.
Already Minneapolis is disbanding the police, urged on by the odious Ilhan Omar:
Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar went beyond calls to defund the police following the death of George Floyd, instead calling for dismantling the Minneapolis Police Department because it is “rotten to the root.”
“We need to completely dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department. Because here’s the thing, there’s a cancer,” she said, continuing that amputation is needed so it doesn’t spread.
Now, anyone who was paying attention knows that these radicals have wanted to get rid of the police all along, so they wouldn't pay for the crimes they committed while rioting.
Can you imagine how things would go with no police to answer the 911 calls?
If your wife or daughter is in danger of getting raped... you call, and get a ""ritual healer""?
If a dangerous drug addict breaks into your house and threatens your life, you call and get.... a ""conflict negotiator""?
If you get caught up in a gang fight or a drug cartel war, who will you call? Your local Antifa rep?
These people don't care about your safety. They want to protect criminals with impunity.
Image
We need to restore law and order NOW. I will work with President Trump to hunt down, prosecute, and imprison any member of Antifa who participated in domestic terrorism.
If you support our ""President of Law and Order"", as I do, I need YOUR help urgently to defeat my high-level radical socialist Democrat opponent and retake this swing seat!
Image
President Trump has accomplished so much with constant pushback from these unreasonable socialists, like these governors and mayors. Imagine what he can do with a supportive Congress!
Will you help me beat anti-cop Socialist G.K. Butterfield and deprive Nancy Pelosi of a reliable vote? I have a goal of $60,000 raised this month, before the fundraising quarter ends. I need your help!
I will NEVER vote with Nancy Pelosi and her ""kneeling radicals""! She and her insane leftist agenda can pound sand!
Can you help me take this swing district back, with your best and immediate contribution of $15, $35, or $250?

863,"Dear Alex,
I am Sandy Smith, the Republican nominee for Congress in North Carolina’s newly redrawn 1st Congressional district.
I am a patriot! I was an original supporter of President Trump in 2015.
Unlike the Republican establishment, I stuck with the president - through all the media’s attempts to discredit him.
I am proud of what President Trump has done during his first term, to include his handling of this horrible Coronavirus attack on our country!
If you are proud of our president, as I am, I need YOUR help urgently to defeat my high-level radical socialist Democrat opponent and retake this swing seat!
My support of the president and my conservative platform of protecting our guns, protecting life, securing the border, and reigning in out of control spending was a major reason I won the Republican primary in March.
Conservative Trump voters in my district voted for me with a whopping 77% of the vote! I won more than 30,000 primary votes in this district - we are on fire for the President and ready to flip this seat!
There are many people coming on board with my campaign. I have already been endorsed by Congressman Mark Walker, Congressman Ted Budd, and Congressman Mark Meadows. Here is a picture of me and Mark Meadows. Congressman Meadows used to be Chairman of the Freedom Caucus, and now he is the President Trump’s Chief of Staff in the White House. He “proudly endorsed” me shortly before his promotion, which I was so honored!
Image
The Congressman whose district I was redrawn into, Democrat G.K. Butterfield, is a high-level Democrat in Nancy Pelosi’s congressional socialist army. He is one of her top lieutenants, and before that, he was a top campaigner for Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump. Taking out Butterfield will deal a massive blow to the anti-American far-left socialist agenda.
Image
I am also honored to have been endorsed by the National Association of Gun Rights and Americans for Legal Immigration PAC. They recognize me as being a staunch defender of our Second Amendment rights and opposing open borders!
With the way President Trump has masterfully handled the Russia hoax, the impeachment hoax, and now the Coronavirus, he will be reelected in a landslide. The Fake News is begging him to stop his nightly press conferences that are getting him higher approval numbers than any president in recent history.
That’s why I’m running. President Trump has accomplished so much with constant pushback from the socialists. Imagine what he can do with a supportive Congress!
First, the Never-Trumper Republican establishment - Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, the “Surrender Caucus”- fought against the President’s attempts to get government out of our Health Care.
Then, Nancy Pelosi and the revenge-driven Democrats started pushing for open borders and higher taxes, a page right out of the Communist Manifesto and implemented by the Soviet Union!
Can you believe this?!? I can’t! That’s why I’m asking for your help most urgently! Please send whatever amount you can spare to get me over the finish line.
It is so crucial that we take advantage of every chance we have to flip a swing district \- which North Carolina’s First District now is! They just redrew the map and took away a bunch of Democrat voters, making this district MUCH more competitive.
Image
As a top anti-Trump attack dog for Pelosi and Hillary, G.K. Butterfield has been responsible for the worst assaults on our Constitution the radical activist Democrat Congress has proposed:
• G. K. Butterfield just voted for the impeachment coup of arguably one of the greatest presidents our nation has elected. He voted for impeachment, not for any crime, but for political differences.
• He supports gun confiscation, socialized medicine, and abortion on demand up until birth. He actually voted for all of these! This makes me so angry!
• Butterfield voted for open borders, allowing for the Coronavirus and other diseases and crime to flood out country. He doesn’t want a wall and wants to let criminal illegal aliens stay here indefinitely – and give them handouts, voting rights, and free college!
• He wants ICE abolished and hates our brave law enforcement officers! This is straight up anti-American!
• G.K. Butterfield votes nearly 100% of the time with Nancy Pelosi. I will vote nearly 0% of the time with Nancy Pelosi! She will be terrified when she loses her top lieutenant when he is defeated in November.
As mentioned above, G. K. Butterfield just voted for the impeachment coup of arguably one of the greatest presidents our nation has elected. Yet, read an excerpt from this explanation of why he voted to impeach President Trump. He called President Trump a domestic enemy!
“President Trump put himself before country and violated his oath of office. The oath I took is clear— I have sworn to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Based on the evidence before us, I voted in favor of both Articles of Impeachment against Donald J. Trump. No one is above the law.” – G.K. Butterfield
Why is Butterfield so radical and why does he hate President Trump so much?
Before this year, he has never had a credible challenger!
But this year, this district turned into a swing district. Half of the district has never been represented by Butterfield. They don’t know him, and they are Republicans!
With President Trump having such high favorability, and with my decisive primary win of 77%, and the fact that do-nothing Butterfield has never had a real opponent, we are going to WIN!
Will you help me beat Butterfield and deprive Nancy Pelosi of a reliable vote? I need you to send $15, $35, or $250 right now so that I can meet my goal by the end of this month. This deadline is so critical, and I have no time to lose.
You already know where I stand and that I will deliver on every important vote.... always! I won't waiver!
I will NEVER vote with Nancy Pelosi! She and her insane leftist agenda can pound sand!
We only need 18 seats to retake Congress. Can you picture what Congress would look like without Nancy Pelosi?
Think about it:
No impeachment. No tax hikes. No socialized medicine. No stifling regulations. No gun confiscations. No infanticide. No gotcha or pork-barrel addons to bills.
To me, THAT’S a future we can agree on! That’s keeping America great.
Can you help me take this swing district back, with your best and immediate contribution of $15, $35, or $250? Taking out one of Pelosi’s leading lieutenants would be a major, crippling blow to the socialist anti-American left and to Nancy Pelosi’s agenda. Please rush back your supporting contribution today. Thank you.
G.K. Butterfield is a leftist extremist, not a patriot, but to replace him I really need your help. I appreciate you and thank you.

I am super short of my monthly goal. We need to raise $60,000 to defeat Pelosi's deputy, GK Butterfield. If everyone who reads my email donates $35, $60, $100 or more we will have more than enough. Will you contribute today?

_______________________________________________
Dear Alex,
I am Sandy Smith, the Republican nominee for Congress in North Carolina’s newly redrawn 1st Congressional district.
As you may know, I come from a military family- including my husband and my children. My family has a legacy of service to keeping the American people safe.
Let me be clear: those who seek to riot and burn, then to blame our brave police for their violence and mistakes, CANNOT be allowed to ""defund the police""!
These riots were never ""peaceful protests"". They were grotesquely violent: over 150 killed, over 20 cops killed, hundreds of businesses and homes burned.
Image
Three black cops and several black civilians were murdered by the rioters, meaning that it was likely never about ""black lives matter"" in the first place.
Of course, it was never just protesters. Antifa, foreign actors and what Bill Barr called a ""witch's brew"" of bad actors drove the violence, arson and murder.
The federal officials gathered with Mr. Barr said they’re tracking the violence nationwide, pointing to investigations into more than 800 arsons and 76 explosive devices at protests. They described the violent actors behind them, from Antifa to the far-right Boogaloo movement.
Mr. Barr called it a “witch’s brew,” and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said different groups are involved in different cities.
Underpinning some of the dissension are the same foreign actors who have tried to meddle in American politics in the past, the officials said — though they didn’t name specific countries nor say exactly what they’ve seen.
Mr. Barr said they are “playing all sides to exacerbate the violence.”
“I believe we have evidence that some foreign hackers and groups associated with foreign governments are focused on this particular situation we have here and exacerbate it every way they can,” he said.
So, possibly Russians or Iranians or ISIS are stirring up a revolution on our streets from young extreme leftists who are murdering cops.
But actually, it's worse than that.
Antifa may be useful idiots to the Russians, but President Trump is not fooled. He is taking on that threat head on!
Image
Sensing weakness in Democrat politicians like New York's DeBlasio, or Chicago's Lightfoot, these Antifa rioters have begun to list demands.... starting with defunding- or eliminating- the police.
Already Minneapolis is disbanding the police, urged on by the odious Ilhan Omar:
Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar went beyond calls to defund the police following the death of George Floyd, instead calling for dismantling the Minneapolis Police Department because it is “rotten to the root.”
“We need to completely dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department. Because here’s the thing, there’s a cancer,” she said, continuing that amputation is needed so it doesn’t spread.
Now, anyone who was paying attention knows that these radicals have wanted to get rid of the police all along, so they wouldn't pay for the crimes they committed while rioting.
Can you imagine how things would go with no police to answer the 911 calls?
If your wife or daughter is in danger of getting raped... you call, and get a ""ritual healer""?
If a dangerous drug addict breaks into your house and threatens your life, you call and get.... a ""conflict negotiator""?
If you get caught up in a gang fight or a drug cartel war, who will you call? Your local Antifa rep?
These people don't care about your safety. They want to protect criminals with impunity.
Image
We need to restore law and order NOW. I will work with President Trump to hunt down, prosecute, and imprison any member of Antifa who participated in domestic terrorism.
If you support our ""President of Law and Order"", as I do, I need YOUR help urgently to defeat my high-level radical socialist Democrat opponent and retake this swing seat!
Image
President Trump has accomplished so much with constant pushback from these unreasonable socialists, like these governors and mayors. Imagine what he can do with a supportive Congress!
Will you help me beat anti-cop Socialist G.K. Butterfield and deprive Nancy Pelosi of a reliable vote? I have a goal of $60,000 raised this month, before the fundraising quarter ends. I need your help!
I will NEVER vote with Nancy Pelosi and her ""kneeling radicals""! She and her insane leftist agenda can pound sand!
Can you help me take this swing district back, with your best and immediate contribution of $15, $35, or $250? Taking out one of Pelosi’s leading lieutenants would be a major, crippling blow to the socialist anti-American left and to Nancy Pelosi’s agenda. Please rush back your supporting contribution today.

I am a patriot! I was an original supporter of President Trump in 2015.
Unlike the Republican establishment, I stuck with the President - through all of the media’s attempts to discredit him.

My support of the President was huge in winning my primary with 77% of the vote! I won more than 30,000 votes in this district - we are on fire for the President and ready to flip this seat!
Consider what President Trump has accomplished, in three short years, despite the treachery of the Swamp and the Democrats:
-Record low unemployment.
-Record low Black and Hispanic unemployment.
-Record low female unemployment.
-Dozens of conservative judges, remaking our Federal judiciary.
-New, better trade agreements with Canada, Mexico, China, and other countries.
-Tax reforms and deregulation, paving the way for sustainable economic growth well into the future.
-Key terrorist leaders like al-Baghdadi and al-Soleimani killed!
The fact is, with 65% of Americans better off today than four years ago, President Trump has done an amazing job. And he WILL win re-election, no matter what the Swamp says!
That’s why I’m running. President Trump has accomplished all of this with constant pushback from the Swamp. Imagine what he can do with a supportive Congress!
First, the Never-Trumper Republican establishment- Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, the “Surrender Caucus”- fought against the President’s attempts to get government out of our Health Care.
Then, Nancy Pelosi and the revenge-driven Democrats started pushing for open borders and higher taxes, a page right out of the Soviet Union!
Now, AOC and Bernie Sanders are trying to bring Cuba’s or Venezuela’s “corrupt Communism” to America.
I’m old enough to remember a time when Americans fought Communism, when Ronald Reagan won the Cold War over the Soviet Union, when America was the “Land of the Free”.
Now, the corrupt Republicans are mostly gone, and the Democrats are flat-out embracing Marxism.
Can you believe this?!? I can’t! That’s why I’m asking for your help!
That’s why it is so crucial that we take advantage of every chance we have to flip a swing district\- which North Carolina’s First District now is!
The Congressman whose district I was redrawn into, Democrat G.K. Butterfield, is a general in Nancy Pelosi’s Congressional Socialist army. He is one of her deputy whips.
As one of Pelosi’s enforcers, G.K. Butterfield has been responsible for some of the worst embarrassments of the do-nothing Democrat Congress over the last two years:
-G. K. Butterfield just voted for the impeachment coup of arguably one of the greatest presidents our nation has elected. He voted for impeachment, not for any crime, but for political differences.
-He supports gun confiscation, socialized medicine, and abortion on demand up until birth. He actually voted for all of these!
-Butterfield voted for open borders. He doesn’t want a wall, and wants to let criminal illegal aliens stay here indefinitely- and let them vote!
-He wants ICE abolished and hates our brave law enforcement officers!
\- G.K. Butterfield votes nearly 100% of the time with Nancy Pelosi. I will vote nearly 0% of the time with Nancy Pelosi!
This is no future for America. This voting record does not merit re-election in a swing district.
I have a different vision for America! I will always defend our Constitution, support President Trump, and fight for the values I hold dear - God, life, family, our rights and our liberties.
I owe it to our citizens to do what is best for the country. And that means running in North Carolina's 1st Congressional District against Democrat G. K. Butterfield.
G. K. Butterfield just voted for the impeachment coup of arguably one of the greatest presidents our nation has elected. He supports gun confiscation, socialism, abortion on demand up until birth, and open borders.
Why is Butterfield so extreme? Before this year, he has never had a credible challenger!
Before the court-ordered redistricting, North Carolina’s First District was a D+36 district. It contained Durham, among other Dem strongholds.
That means that no credible Republicans ever challenged him.
It means that the local media never challenged him.
He is comfortable, and doesn’t know HOW to fight. He never had to learn!
But this year, this district turned into a D+2 district. Half of the district has never been represented by Butterfield. They don’t know him- and they are Republicans!
These are my neighbors. They won’t accept a liberal extremist like Butterfield. They are excited to come out and vote for President Trump and for me- because I will support the MAGA agenda in Congress!
Will you help me beat Butterfield and deprive Nancy Pelosi of a reliable vote?
The Dems have used the courts to cheat and choose their own voters to get rid of good Republicans the last few years. They took advantage of their new opportunities- that’s how you take Congress.
Here, we have a unique opportunity. A D+36 district got changed into a D+2 district overnight. That means it’s a swing district - and a good Republican with working class appeal can flip this district!
You already know where I stand and that I will deliver on every important vote.... always! I won't waiver!
I will NEVER vote with Nancy Pelosi! She and her insane leftist agenda can go to Hell!
I am pro-America. Democrats like AOC and Butterfield are anti-America. We will defeat them together- but only with your help!
Butterfield has half a million dollars of dirty Swamp money. But I have already raised $500,000 myself- and with your help, I will have the resources to beat him!
Pelosi takes her leftists wherever she can find them. It's time to fight back - together!
Can you help me?
I need your help urgently to make sure Butterfield doesn’t bury me early. I need the resources to define him, inform voters- and win this crucial race!
We only need 18 seats to retake Congress. Can you picture what Congress would look like without Nancy Pelosi?
Think about it:
-No impeachment.
-No tax hikes.
-No socialized medicine.
-No stifling regulations.
-No gun confiscations.
-No infanticide.
To me, THAT’S a future we can agree on! That’s keeping America great.
That’s a Congress that will produce for us, instead of embarrassing us.
We need to stop impeachment and any Congressman who voted for it. Let's save our country!
Can you help me take this swing district back, with your maximum contribution of $25, $50, $100, $250, $500, $1000, or even $2800 per individual, $5600 per couple?
Can you show your support of our Constitution and our President, with the largest contribution you can make? Anything you can give is much appreciated!
I know there’s a lot of needs. Because of Pelosi’s extremism, there’s a lot of seats we can flip.
But taking out one of Pelosi’s leading generals would be a major, crippling blow to the American Left.
Without Butterfield, Pelosi will be without a right hand.
We can strike a crucial blow to the Dems by taking this seat back. Pelosi will never recover- which is OK by me!
Your contribution will make a BIG difference here. Let’s go beat the Democrats together- with YOUR help!

Here, we have a unique opportunity. A D+36 district got changed into a D+2 district overnight. That means it’s a swing district- and a good Republican with working class appeal can flip this district!
You already know where I stand and that I will deliver on every important vote.... always! I won't waiver!
I am pro-America. Democrats like AOC and Butterfield are anti-America. We will defeat them together- but only with your help!
Butterfield has half a million dollars of dirty Swamp money. But I have already raised $500,000 myself- and with your help, I will have the resources to beat him!
Pelosi takes her leftists wherever she can find them. It's time to fight back - together!
Can you help me?
I need your help urgently to make sure Butterfield doesn’t bury me early. I need the resources to define him, inform voters- and win this crucial race!
We only need 18 seats to retake Congress. Can you picture what Congress would look like without Nancy Pelosi?
Think about it:
-No impeachment.
-No tax hikes.
-No socialized medicine.
-No stifling regulations.
-No gun confiscations.
-No infanticide.
To me, THAT’S a future we can agree on! That’s keeping America great.
That’s a Congress that will produce for us, instead of embarrassing us.
We need to stop impeachment and any Congressman who voted for it. Let's save our country!
Can you show your support of our Constitution and our President, with the largest contribution you can make? Anything you can give is much appreciated!
I know there’s a lot of needs. Because of Pelosi’s extremism, there’s a lot of seats we can flip.
But taking out one of Pelosi’s leading generals would be a major, crippling blow to the American Left.
Without Butterfield, Pelosi will be without a right hand.
We can strike a crucial blow to the Dems by taking this seat back. Pelosi will never recover- which is OK by me!
I have a big fundraising deadline at the end of this month, I must raise $50,000 to keep pace with my radical Dem opponent.
Can you help me take this swing district back, with your maximum contribution of $25, $50, $100, $250, $500, $1000, or even $2800 per individual, $5600 per couple?
Your contribution will make a BIG difference here. Let’s go beat the Democrats together- with YOUR help!

When a politician gets rich off of the public, and tries to take away our guns and police while having protection for himself.... it's time to go!
I am Sandy Smith, the Republican nominee for North Carolina's crucial First District, fighting to expose the Swamp Monster G.K. Butterfield!
This guy is absolutely awful. He wants to take away our gun rights. He wants to defund police.
But that means that we we are left defenseless in one of the highest crime districts in America.... because of him.
Having him as a Congressman is awful. He positively hates our district, never comes back here and never lifts a finger for us.
The only time we hear from him is when he's shilling for radical ""social justice"" groups- trying to defund police or make abortion legal even after birth!
This guy is just too radical for us.
Image
I am not a radical Leftist like G.K. Butterfield. I am a business owner, a military mom, and have supported President Trump from Day One!
We don't need San Francisco politics here in North Carolina! Can you help me send Pelosi a message?
This guy's record is horrible. He's Pelosi's stooge, voting with her 99% of the time. He votes with the far, far, far Left.... not with us!
Image
This guy is a bad Congressman and a direct threat to our rights. He HAS to go!
The whole election may turn on North Carolina. The President needs it, we have a key Senate race here, and my race is critical for retaking the House!
I'm in a VERY close race with one of Pelosi's clones, G.K. Butterfield. We have raised over $1 million and can win!! Your support could be the thing that gets us over the top here!
If you want President Trump to win next month, we need to stand together right now! The Left is going all-out; we patriots need to also!
Can you help me win this swing district in this swing state, with your urgent contribution of $25, $50, $100, $250, $500, $1000 or more? It's not the time to complain or fatigue... it's the time to win, and win now!
G.K. Butterfield's record is awful, but to replace him I really need you today! Let's stand up to these hypocrites now, before it's too late!

870,"Dear Alex,
I am Sandy Smith, the Republican nominee for Congress in North Carolina’s newly redrawn 1st Congressional district.
I am a patriot! I was an original supporter of President Trump in 2015.
Unlike the Republican establishment, I stuck with the president - through all the media’s attempts to discredit him.
I am proud of what President Trump has done during his first term, to include his handling of this horrible Coronavirus attack on our country!
If you are proud of our president, as I am, I need YOUR help urgently to defeat my high-level radical socialist Democrat opponent and retake this swing seat!
My support of the president and my conservative platform of protecting our guns, protecting life, securing the border, and reigning in out of control spending was a major reason I won the Republican primary in March.
Conservative Trump voters in my district voted for me with a whopping 77% of the vote! I won more than 30,000 primary votes in this district - we are on fire for the President and ready to flip this seat!
There are many people coming on board with my campaign. I have already been endorsed by Congressman Mark Walker, Congressman Ted Budd, and Congressman Mark Meadows. Here is a picture of me and Mark Meadows. Congressman Meadows used to be Chairman of the Freedom Caucus, and now he is the President Trump’s Chief of Staff in the White House. He “proudly endorsed” me shortly before his promotion, which I was so honored!
Image
The Congressman whose district I was redrawn into, Democrat G.K. Butterfield, is a high-level Democrat in Nancy Pelosi’s congressional socialist army. He is one of her top lieutenants, and before that, he was a top campaigner for Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump. Taking out Butterfield will deal a massive blow to the anti-American far-left socialist agenda.
Image
I am also honored to have been endorsed by the National Association of Gun Rights and Americans for Legal Immigration PAC. They recognize me as being a staunch defender of our Second Amendment rights and opposing open borders!
With the way President Trump has masterfully handled the Russia hoax, the impeachment hoax, and now the Coronavirus, he will be reelected in a landslide. The Fake News is begging him to stop his nightly press conferences that are getting him higher approval numbers than any president in recent history.
That’s why I’m running. President Trump has accomplished so much with constant pushback from the socialists. Imagine what he can do with a supportive Congress!
First, the Never-Trumper Republican establishment - Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, the “Surrender Caucus”- fought against the President’s attempts to get government out of our Health Care.
Then, Nancy Pelosi and the revenge-driven Democrats started pushing for open borders and higher taxes, a page right out of the Communist Manifesto and implemented by the Soviet Union!
Can you believe this?!? I can’t! That’s why I’m asking for your help most urgently! Please send whatever amount you can spare to get me over the finish line.
It is so crucial that we take advantage of every chance we have to flip a swing district \- which North Carolina’s First District now is! They just redrew the map and took away a bunch of Democrat voters, making this district MUCH more competitive.
Image
As a top anti-Trump attack dog for Pelosi and Hillary, G.K. Butterfield has been responsible for the worst assaults on our Constitution the radical activist Democrat Congress has proposed:
• G. K. Butterfield just voted for the impeachment coup of arguably one of the greatest presidents our nation has elected. He voted for impeachment, not for any crime, but for political differences.
• He supports gun confiscation, socialized medicine, and abortion on demand up until birth. He actually voted for all of these! This makes me so angry!
• Butterfield voted for open borders, allowing for the Coronavirus and other diseases and crime to flood out country. He doesn’t want a wall and wants to let criminal illegal aliens stay here indefinitely – and give them handouts, voting rights, and free college!
• He wants ICE abolished and hates our brave law enforcement officers! This is straight up anti-American!
• G.K. Butterfield votes nearly 100% of the time with Nancy Pelosi. I will vote nearly 0% of the time with Nancy Pelosi! She will be terrified when she loses her top lieutenant when he is defeated in November.
As mentioned above, G. K. Butterfield just voted for the impeachment coup of arguably one of the greatest presidents our nation has elected. Yet, read an excerpt from this explanation of why he voted to impeach President Trump. He called President Trump a domestic enemy!
“President Trump put himself before country and violated his oath of office. The oath I took is clear— I have sworn to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Based on the evidence before us, I voted in favor of both Articles of Impeachment against Donald J. Trump. No one is above the law.” – G.K. Butterfield
Why is Butterfield so radical and why does he hate President Trump so much?
Before this year, he has never had a credible challenger!
But this year, this district turned into a swing district. Half of the district has never been represented by Butterfield. They don’t know him, and they are Republicans!
With President Trump having such high favorability, and with my decisive primary win of 77%, and the fact that do-nothing Butterfield has never had a real opponent, we are going to WIN!
Will you help me beat Butterfield and deprive Nancy Pelosi of a reliable vote? I need you to send $15, $35, or $250 right now so that I can meet my goal by the end of this month. This deadline is so critical, and I have no time to lose.
You already know where I stand and that I will deliver on every important vote.... always! I won't waiver!
I will NEVER vote with Nancy Pelosi! She and her insane leftist agenda can pound sand!
We only need 18 seats to retake Congress. Can you picture what Congress would look like without Nancy Pelosi?
Think about it:
No impeachment. No tax hikes. No socialized medicine. No stifling regulations. No gun confiscations. No infanticide. No gotcha or pork-barrel addons to bills.
To me, THAT’S a future we can agree on! That’s keeping America great.
Can you help me take this swing district back, with your best and immediate contribution of $15, $35, or $250? Taking out one of Pelosi’s leading lieutenants would be a major, crippling blow to the socialist anti-American left and to Nancy Pelosi’s agenda. Please rush back your supporting contribution today. Thank you.
G.K. Butterfield is a leftist extremist, not a patriot, but to replace him I really need your help. I appreciate you and thank you.

871,"Dear Alex,
I am Sandy Smith, Republican candidate for Congress in North Carolina’s newly redrawn 1st Congressional district.
I am a patriot! I was an original supporter of President Trump in 2015.
Unlike the Republican establishment, I stuck with the President- through all of the media’s attempts to discredit him.
I am proud of what President Trump has done! I am a true warrior for the President and his MAGA agenda.
If you are proud of our President, as I am, I need YOUR help urgently to defeat my Democrat opponent and retake this swing seat!
Consider what President Trump has accomplished, in three short years, despite the treachery of the Swamp and the Democrats:
-Record low unemployment.
-Record low Black and Hispanic unemployment.
-Record low female unemployment.
-Dozens of conservative judges, remaking our Federal judiciary.
-New, better trade agreements with Canada, Mexico, China, and other countries.
-Tax reforms and deregulation, paving the way for sustainable economic growth well into the future.
-Key terrorist leaders like al-Baghdadi and al-Soleimani killed!
The fact is, with 65% of Americans better off today than four years ago, President Trump has done an amazing job. And he WILL win re-election, no matter what the Swamp says!
That’s why I’m running. President Trump has accomplished all of this with constant pushback from the Swamp. Imagine what he can do with a supportive Congress!
First, the Never-Trumper Republican establishment - Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, the “Surrender Caucus”- fought against the President’s attempts to get government out of our Health Care.
Then, Nancy Pelosi and the revenge-driven Democrats started pushing for open borders and higher taxes, a page right out of the Soviet Union!
Now, AOC and Bernie Sanders are trying to bring Cuba’s or Venezuela’s “corrupt Communism” to America.
I’m old enough to remember a time when Americans fought Communism, when Ronald Reagan won the Cold War over the Soviet Union, when America was the “Land of the Free”.
Now, the corrupt Republicans are mostly gone, and the Democrats are flat-out embracing Marxism.
Can you believe this?!? I can’t! That’s why I’m asking for your help most urgently!
That’s why it is so crucial that we take advantage of every chance we have to flip a swing district - which North Carolina’s First District now is!
The Congressman whose district I was redrawn into, Democrat G.K. Butterfield, is a general in Nancy Pelosi’s Congressional Socialist army. He is one of her deputy whips.
As one of Pelosi’s enforcers, G.K. Butterfield has been responsible for some of the worst embarrassments of the do-nothing Democrat Congress over the last two years:
-G. K. Butterfield just voted for the impeachment coup of arguably one of the greatest presidents our nation has elected. He voted for impeachment, not for any crime, but for political differences.
-He supports gun confiscation, socialized medicine, and abortion on demand up until birth. He actually voted for all of these!
-Butterfield voted for open borders. He doesn’t want a wall, and wants to let criminal illegal aliens stay here indefinitely - and let them vote!
-He wants ICE abolished and hates our brave law enforcement officers!
\- G.K. Butterfield votes nearly 100% of the time with Nancy Pelosi. I will vote nearly 0% of the time with Nancy Pelosi!
This is no future for America. This voting record does not merit re-election in a swing district.
I have a different vision for America! I will always defend our Constitution, support President Trump, and fight for the values I hold dear - God, life, family, our rights and our liberties.
I owe it to our citizens to do what is best for the country. And that means running in North Carolina's 1st Congressional District against Democrat G. K. Butterfield.
G. K. Butterfield just voted for the impeachment coup of arguably one of the greatest presidents our nation has elected. He supports gun confiscation, socialism, abortion on demand up until birth, and open borders.
Why is Butterfield so extreme? Before this year, he has never had a credible challenger!
Before the court-ordered redistricting, North Carolina’s First District was a D+36 district. It contained Durham, among other Dem strongholds.
That means that no credible Republicans ever challenged him.
It means that the local media never challenged him.
He is fat and happy, and doesn’t know HOW to fight. He never had to learn!
But this year, this district turned into a D+2 district. Half of the district has never been represented by Butterfield. They don’t know him- and they are Republicans!
These are my neighbors. They won’t accept a liberal extremist like Butterfield. They are excited to come out and vote for President Trump and for me- because I will support the MAGA agenda in Congress!
Will you help me beat Butterfield and deprive Nancy Pelosi of a reliable vote?
The Dems have used the courts to cheat and choose their own voters to get rid of good Republicans the last few years. They took advantage of their new opportunities- that’s how you take Congress.
Here, we have a unique opportunity. A D+36 district got changed into a D+2 district overnight. That means it’s a swing district\- and a good Republican with working class appeal can flip this district!

WHILE KELLY LOEFFLER STANDS FOR LAW AND ORDER, DOUG COLLINS IS WEAK ON CRIME AND IMMIGRATION
ATLANTA – Doug Collins claims to be ""conservative,"" but his record says otherwise. For years, he has voted with liberal Democrats like Stacey Abrams and Nancy Pelosi to advance a radical, left-wing agenda.
In the State House, Collins teamed up with liberal Stacey Abrams to undermine the 2nd Amendment, raise taxes on hardworking Georgians, and reduce prison time for violent criminals.
In between stints as a politician, Doug worked as a criminal defense attorney, specifically marketing his services to people accused of the most heinous crimes, including murder, rape and child cruelty. Doug explicitly solicited violent criminals, promising to ""shoulder [their] burden"" by pushing for lighter sentences. Some defendants returned to the streets to commit worse crimes.
In Congress, D.C. Doug repeatedly voted to approve and fund dangerous left-wing policies, including Obama's amnesty and sanctuary cities.
Meanwhile, Kelly Loeffler has been a champion for law and order. She has voted with President Trump 100 percent of the time to strengthen our borders, support our law enforcement and crack down on rioters, looters and left-wing mobs. Senator Loeffler has introduced legislation to:
* Create a national gang database
* Speed up the deportation process for gang members in our country illegally
* Increase criminal penalties for gang members
* Defund jurisdictions that defund their police
* Make looting small businesses a federal crime
* Cut funds to jurisdictions that refuse to prosecute looters
* Allow concealed carry for prosecutors and federal judges
* Allow judges to issue arrest warrants for illegal immigrants who miss court hearings
* Facilitate holding accused rioters for trial by refusing catch-and-release policies
* Bar federally convicted rioters from receiving virus-related unemployment benefits
* Create a federal, private and civil cause of action for victims of rioters to seek damages
“No matter how hard Doug Collins tries to hide it, he’s got a well-documented history of siding with liberals like Stacey Abrams and Nancy Pelosi to weaken our laws and endanger our citizens,” said Communications Director Stephen Lawson. “Whether as a trial lawyer who worked to put violent offenders back on the street, or as a politician who voted to fund sanctuary cities and reduce criminal penalties, Doug Collins has always put criminals ahead of the safety of Georgia families. There is only one candidate in this race who has stood with President Trump 100 percent of the time to crack down on crime and support our law enforcement – and that’s conservative Kelly Loeffler.”
BACKGROUND
In 2014, Collins voted for a $1.1 trillion omnibus that funded President Obama’s Executive Orders granting amnesty to illegal immigrants. (Roll Call Vote #563, 12/11/14) (""Vote Alert: House: $1.1T Bill That Funds Executive Amnesty,"" Conservative Review, 9/17/14; ""NumbersUSA to grade CRomnibus vote as a vote for Amnesty,"" NumbersUSA, 12/9/14)
In 2008, Collins Sponsored HB 1298 With Stacey Abrams – A Bill To Make It Easier For Violent Criminal Defendants To Claim Mental Insanity And Thereby Avoid The Death Penalty Or A Life Sentence Without Parole In Murder Cases (H.B. 1298, Georgia General Assembly, Introduced 2/21/08)
Collins & Csider’s Website Marketed Its Services To Defendants Accused Of Felonies And Misdemeanors (Collins & Csider, Archived 8/12/15)
In July 2009, Collins Defended Danny Clore On Charges Of Methamphetamine Distribution And Misdemeanor Possession Of Marijuana. The Meth Distribution Charge Was Dismissed While The Marijuana Charge Was Conditionally Discharged. (Case No. 2009CR000723, Hall County Superior Court, Filed 7/17/09)
Clore Went On To Commit More Crimes, Including Aggravated Assault, Illegal Possession Of A Firearm, And Obstructing A Police Officer. (Hall County Courts, Accessed 2/5/20)
Clore Led Police On A High-Speed Chase In 2015 After Shooting At Two Vehicles With Occupants Inside Them; Meth Was Found On His Person When He Was Arrested. “A Gainesville man wanted in Hall County in connection with a shooting was arrested Saturday after dogs and deputies tracked him through the woods of Rabun County. ‘We continued tracking (Danny Ray Clore) and later located a camo (waterproof) box that contained drugs and other .380 magazines,’ according to the report. ‘Minutes later (Clore) was located hiding behind a large log on the ground…’ Deputies responded to that incident around 1:30 p.m. to reports of someone ‘firing rounds from an automatic weapon,’ Hall County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Deputy Nicole Bailes said. ‘Clore shot at two vehicles that each had two occupants inside the vehicles at the time of the incident,’ Bailes wrote in an email… Officers chased Clore, who reportedly was ‘weaving in and out and traveling at a high rate of speed...’ ‘(The officer) then searched in the leaves where (Clore) was laying and located a Ruger .380 pistol and a Ziploc bag containing what appeared to (be) methamphetamine,’ according to the report. He was charged with possession of methamphetamine, fleeing and eluding by the Rabun County Sheriff’s Office.” (Nick Watson, “Authorities: Gainesville Shooting Suspect Captured After Chase Through Woods,” Gainesville Times, 11/23/15)
In June 2008, Collins Defended Shacara Rucker On Charges Of Armed Robbery, Criminal Conspiracy, Two Kidnappings, Four Aggravated Assaults, Theft, And Possessing A Firearm For Use In A Crime. Rucker and accomplices Scroger and Cook Were Found Guilty Of Criminal Conspiracy And Two Kidnappings, Though The Kidnappings Were Amended To Lighter Charges. The Armed Robbery, Aggravated Assault, And Theft Charges Against Rucker, Scroger, And Cook Were Dismissed. (Case No. 2009CR000650, Hall County Superior Court, Filed 6/30/08)
The Defendants Reportedly Robbed A McDonald’s Restaurant At Gunpoint, Forcing Employees Into A Walk-In Cooler. “Five people have been arrested in connection with the early morning armed robbery of a Flowery Branch McDonald’s restaurant, including an employee whom investigators believe was involved. Hall County Sheriff’s Col. Jeff Strickland said two females and two males were let into the restaurant at 3 a.m. Friday by an employee, supposedly to use the bathroom. One of the four suspects pulled out a small caliber handgun and forced two of the restaurant’s three employees into a walk-in cooler. The third employee opened the safe for the robbers and handed over an undisclosed amount of cash, Strickland said. No one was injured and the cooler was not locked…After questioning the employees, investigators determined that one of the McDonald’s workers, 24-year-old Jeremy Scroger, assisted in the robbery, Strickland said. After securing a search warrant, investigators recovered the handgun and the stolen money from the Mazda, Strickland said. Scroger was charged with armed robbery and kidnapping. Also charged with armed robbery and kidnapping were Sidney Lewis Howell, 17, Shinard Ryaston Cook, 18, Siedah Yasmeen Smith, 21, and Shacarra Rucker, 18.” (Stephen Gurr, “Five Are Arrested In McDonalds Robbery,” Gainesville Times, 5/29/09)

KAMALA HARRIS AND DOUG COLLINS WEAK ON CRIME, PRIORITIZED VIOLENT CRIMINALS OVER THE SAFETY OF AMERICAN FAMILIES
ATLANTA -- The Georgians for Kelly Loeffler campaign issued the following statement following the news that Kamala Harris recently helped free defendants who have been charged with murder, violent felonies, and sex crimes, just like Doug Collins did in his work as a criminal defense attorney.
“Just like Kamala Harris, Doug Collins earned a paycheck by putting the interests of criminals before the safety of law-abiding Americans. As a criminal defense attorney, Doug Collins marketed directly to some of Georgia's most heinous offenders – fighting to keep drug dealers, domestic abusers, kidnappers and robbers out of prison. Thanks to the efforts of career politicians like Kamala Harris and Doug Collins, violent criminals are back on the streets and continue terrorizing communities in Georgia and across the country,” said Communications Director Stephen Lawson.
“Unlike Doug Collins, Kelly Loeffler believes that violent criminals belong in jail. Georgians deserve a law and order candidate like Kelly Loeffler who will stand with our men and women in law enforcement to protect Georgia families--not a career politician and criminal defense attorney like Doug Collins who cares more about his own pocketbook than Georgians' public safety.”

GEORGIA SHERIFFS DENOUNCE DOUG COLLINS' CRIMINAL DEFENSE HISTORY
ATLANTA – Today, Georgia sheriffs issued a joint statement disavowing career politician Doug Collins' disastrous record of siding with violent criminals and endorsing Kelly Loeffler as the only law and order candidate in the race for her United States Senate seat:
“Kelly Loeffler has proven that she will stand with our law enforcement community to protect Georgia families and communities.
""Doug Collins has made a career out of putting the interests of criminals before the safety of Georgia’s families. In the Georgia legislature, he teamed up with Stacey Abrams to reduce prison sentences for violent offenders. As a criminal defense attorney, Collins defended drug dealers and domestic abusers, some of whom went on to commit even worse crimes.
""Georgia needs a leader who will always stand up for law and order-- not violent criminals – which is why we’re proud to endorse Kelly Loeffler for United States Senate.""
Sheriff Jud Smith, Barrow County
Sheriff Clark Millsap, Bartow County
Sheriff Jim Proctor, Camden County
Sheriff Gary Sisk, Catoosa County
Sheriff Neal Jump, Glynn County
Sheriff Butch Conway, Gwinnett County
Sheriff Mike Jolley, Harris County
Sheriff Robert Oglesby, Jenkins County
Sheriff Joe Chapman, Walton County
Not only does Senator Loeffler have the endorsement of over a dozen sheriffs and district attorneys across Georgia, she also has a strong legislative record of supporting law enforcement. Last week, she introduced legislation to crack down on criminal gang activity, strengthen criminal gang sentencing guidelines, and deport illegal gang members. She has also introduced legislation to withhold federal funding from jurisdictions that attempt to defund their police departments.
Doug Collins, meanwhile, has a well-documented history of siding with criminals instead of holding them accountable. In the Georgia legislature, he teamed up with Stacey Abrams to reduce prison time for violent criminals. As a criminal defense attorney, he helped reduce and eliminate sentences for murderers, rapists, and child abusers - putting them back on the streets and jeopardizing the safety of our families and public safety officers alike.

EXPOSED: DOUG COLLINS' LIBERAL VOTING RECORD
ATLANTA – Actions always speak louder than words, and while career politician Doug Collins claims to be a ""conservative,"" his extensive liberal voting record says otherwise. Georgians need to be aware of the truth about D.C. Doug Collins:
* Received an ""F"" rating from Conservative Review.
* Ranked second-most liberal Georgia Republican in the House.
* Ranked more liberal than 87% of Congressional Republicans.
* Ranked the 173rd most conservative member of Congress –– He even has a more liberal voting record than multiple House Democrats.
* Voted with Nancy Pelosi over 800 times.
* Voted with Stacey Abrams over 300 times.
* Voted for every single one of Barack Obama's big-spending budgets.
* Voted to fund amnesty, sanctuary cities and Common Core.
* Worked with radical liberal Stacey Abrams to undermine 2nd-Amendment Rights in Georgia and put violent criminals back on the streets.
* Received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Big Tech companies and then protected them from investigation in Congress.
""For 15 years, Doug Collins has sold out Georgia conservatives. He's ranked one of the most liberal Congressional Republicans, voted with Nancy Pelosi over 800 times, partnered with Stacey Abrams over 300 times, and even received an 'F' rating from Conservative Review,"" said Kelly Loeffler. ""Georgians deserve a true conservative champion and a political outsider who won't pay lip service to hardworking Georgians and their families. As the most conservative U.S. Senator in America who is endorsed by National Right to Life and has a 100-percent Trump voting record, I am the only candidate in this race with a proven record of results. No matter what, I will always stand up and fight for our conservative values.""
While fake conservative Doug Collins says one thing and does another, Kelly Loeffler has been hard at work to advance President Trump's conservative agenda. Notably, Kelly Loeffler has a 100-percent Trump voting record, and she was recently ranked the most conservative senator in America. She will always protect innocent life, stand up for the 2nd Amendment, crack down on crime and illegal immigration and fight the far-left extremists who want to take over America.

876,"Friend,
Kelly stood strong for law-and-order this week - taking several major actions to support our police officers, crack down on criminals, and bring peace back to our streets.
In major news, Kelly was the first candidate in her race to call for convicted cop killers to be sentenced to death for their crimes. Her strong stand comes just days after two sheriff's deputies – who are still recovering in the hospital – were brutally ambushed by a masked gunman in Los Angeles. As Kelly said:
""For months, the radical left’s defund the police movement has promoted violence, chaos and anarchy in cities across our country, while villainizing and attacking the brave men and women in law enforcement who risk their lives to keep us safe. Now these dangerous leftists have started putting words into violent action — targeting and brutally attacking law enforcement. That’s why today I am calling for convicted cop killers in America to be sentenced to death.""
In fact, Kelly even blasted Kamala Harris this week for her failure to denounce the ""disgusting"" display of hatred toward the injured deputies by protesters outside the hospital. She slammed Kamala for promoting a bail fund to free violent criminals - including those who are targeting our police officers on the streets. And later in the week, Kelly took action - joining her colleagues to introduce the ""Serve and Protect Act,"" which would slap offenders like the Compton gunman with a 10 years-to-life sentence for targeting law enforcement officers for assault or murder.
In addition to being recognized for her law-and-order values this week, Kelly also won praise for her pro-life positions - receiving an ""A"" rating from the Susan B. Anthony List, which has already strongly endorsed her campaign. Kelly is 100% pro-life - and will always fight against the abortion-on-demand agenda of the Left.
On top of that, Kelly took a few more principled stands this week - slamming Disney for its cozy relationship with China, and pushing back hard against Netflix's new Cuties movie for its exploitation of young children. She has led on this issue, calling for a hearing on preventing human and child trafficking.
Finally, Kelly joined President Trump at the White House for the signing of the Abraham Accords, which marked the historic normalization of relations in the Middle East. As Kelly said on the Guy Benson show this week:
""This is the fulfillment of promises made and kept by President Trump from day one. Truly historic to see the leaders from UAE and Bahrain on the stage with Netanyahu and President Trump. Truly historic and important. I mean, this is a fulfillment of the president's promise of ongoing building peace through strength ... He's delivered at every step along the way, whether it's dealing with North Korea or Iran and now bringing peace to the Middle East in this very historic and certainly Nobel-peace worthy agreement.""
Speaking of promises kept, Kelly announced this week that Accura Engineering, a Georgia-owned business, has been awarded a government contract to play a key role in constructing the border wall. Kelly is a strong proponent of President Trump's wall, and she is thrilled to see a Georgia business contribute so much to this effort.
While Kelly fights for conservative Georgia values, the same can't be said for her opponents. Doug Collins is a weak-on-crime career politician who has teamed up with radical liberal Stacey Abrams to undercut the 2nd Amendment, raise taxes on hardworking Georgians, and reduce prison time for violent criminals. Instead of fighting for Georgians, Doug spent years embracing Abrams and building close friendships with unhinged liberals like impeachment manager Hakeem Jeffries, who called Donald Trump the ""grand wizard of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.""

It was a big week for the campaign! With Kelly surging in the polls and with Georgians across the state coalescing behind her strong conservative message and record of results, it's clear that Team Kelly has the momentum on our side.
The latest poll of our race, released this week, shows Kelly with a commanding lead over Doug Collins. According to the poll, Kelly is leading Collins 26% - 20%. Even better: she's beating him by 7% among Trump voters and 11% among Republican voters.
﻿Clearly, Georgia's conservatives agree: it's time to stop electing career politicians who don't get things done – or worse, who have a long history of siding with liberals and special interests groups. To learn more about why Georgia's conservatives are ditching D.C. Doug, click HERE.
In fact, even Georgia's sheriffs are speaking out about Doug's shameful past – this week issuing a statement denouncing his record of siding with violent criminals, partnering with soft-on-crime liberals, and jeopardizing the safety of Georgia families:
""Doug Collins has made a career out of putting the interests of criminals before the safety of Georgia’s families. In the Georgia legislature, he teamed up with Stacey Abrams to reduce prison sentences for violent offenders. As a criminal defense attorney, Collins defended drug dealers and domestic abusers, some of whom went on to commit even worse crimes.
""Georgia needs a leader who will always stand up for law and order– not violent criminals – which is why we’re proud to endorse Kelly Loeffler for United States Senate.""
Kelly, meanwhile, continues to stand up for our law enforcement officers and the security of all Americans – vocally supporting President Trump's efforts to restore law and order to Democrat-run cities, and introducing her own legislation to crack down on gang crime and deport criminal illegals. She even spoke to the Georgia Sheriff's Association this week – highlighting her promise to defund any cities that try to defund the police.
In fact, Kelly talked extensively this week with Breitbart and One America News about her strong support for our police officers – and her strong opposition to groups like the BLM political organization that are trying to defund them. You can listen to her full Breitbart interview HERE, and click the photo below to watch her discussion with One America News:
Kelly also hosted Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma on Monday at a roundtable event with Georgia healthcare leaders to discuss ways to combat the coronavirus in Georgia. This roundtable event builds on Kelly's work to support Georgia healthcare during the COVID-19 crisis, including her push for expanded telehealth services, her efforts to secure greater federal funding for rural hospitals, and her work to expand access to rural healthcare generally.

Kelly took another strong stand this week - refusing to be silenced by cancel culture, and fighting to give conservatives a voice in the era of the woke mob.
As you may have seen, the WNBA staged a stunt on Wednesday in response to Kelly's opposition to the radical Black Lives Matter political organization - which the league embraced. To no surprise, it turns out that failed gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams was behind the ploy.
Kelly appeared on The Ingraham Angle to respond to WNBA players’ recent choice to wear t-shirts endorsing her Democrat opponent, Raphael Warnock. As Kelly said:
“This isn’t about playing basketball, it’s about playing politics … But I stood up for our American flag, suggested that we replace the divisive idea of this political organization Black Lives Matter … I had to draw the line, and I had to speak out....I think we all know the power that sports has to bring people together … and that’s been totally eradicated here in this moment where, because I have a conservative voice, they want me out, they want to cancel [[URL REDACTED]] is emblematic of what’s happening across the country … I’m standing up because I have a platform for Americans that feel like they can’t have a voice.""
Click HERE or on the photo below to watch the full interview.
While Kelly has been fighting nonstop for conservative values, the same can't be said for career politician Doug Collins.
He claims to be a conservative, yet in the State House, Doug teamed up with his ""good friend"" Stacey Abrams to vote for the ""largest tax increase"" in Georgia history. He also voted for higher taxes on cars, guns, farmers and even marriage.
Georgians deserve a conservative businessperson like Kelly Loeffler who knows how to balance a budget and create jobs – not another phony politician like Doug Collins who taxes everything, spends recklessly, and views taxpayers as a piggybank for his paycheck. Click below to see our newest ad, exposing phony Doug's cringeworthy record of supporting tax hikes on Georgia's families:
Because of her strong efforts to protect conservative speech and stand up for our values, support for Kelly is growing at an astronomical rate, as we announced this week. Since March, our campaign has:
* Hired over 30 field staff and interns
* Launched a Satellite Office in Athens dedicated to voter outreach
* Made over 600,000 phone calls to voters
* Sent over 400,000 texts to voters
* Handwritten and sent over 5,000 postcards to voters
* Placed over 5,000 yard signs around the state
* Met with over 1,000 Georgians on her recess tour
* Established grassroots leadership teams in all 159 counties
* Secured endorsements from 100+ state and local officials
With clear advantages in resources, infrastructure, and grassroots support, Team Kelly is clearly building toward a big win in November!
Meanwhile, back in Washington, Kelly has been fighting to restore law and order in America's cities, and crack down on crime and looting. This week, Kelly introduced several pieces of legislation, including a bill to legalize concealed carry for prosecutors and federal judges, a bill that would allow judges to issue arrest warrants for illegal immigrants who miss court hearings, and a bill that would cut aid to jurisdictions that do not prosecute looters.

This week, Kelly joined President Trump in taking a strong stand against the senseless violence and lawlessness occurring in Atlanta and other Democrat-run cities cross America.
Kelly's major push for law and order comes on the heels of her wildly successful All About Georgia Recess Tour, where she spent two weeks rallying with hardworking Georgians at dozens of meet-and-greets across the state. With hundreds of energized conservatives at each event, Kelly is the only candidate in her race to plan and complete a successful statewide tour. She is also the only candidate with grassroots organization in all 159 counties, and boasts a strong lead in local and state endorsements.
On Tuesday, Kelly introduced legislation to crack down on gang activity. Kelly's plan would make it easier to put gang members behind bars by increasing sentences for gang-related crimes and creating a nationwide database to track gang activity. It also increases the likelihood of deporting a gang member who is in the country illegally. Governor Brian Kemp, Attorney General Chris Carr and Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vic Reynolds have all endorsed Kelly's plan.
On Wednesday, Kelly joined Charles Payne on Fox News to discuss her plan, and to stand with President Trump as he fights to restore law and order in Democrat-run cities across America. As Kelly said:
“[My bill] is aimed at exactly what the President was just talking about. Our first duty is to keep Americans safe and secure, to protect families across our communities. This anti-gang statute that I’m introducing at the federal level helps update outdated federal gang statutes – making it easier to prosecute gang members and to deport illegal immigrants who conduct crime in organized gangs…we need to stop this senseless violence…we have to draw the line right now....

From fighting against the 'defund the police' movement, to sponsoring legislation to deport criminal illegal aliens, Kelly has a rock solid record of standing with law enforcement against criminal activity and gang violence. Unfortunately for the safety of Georgia's families, Doug Collins does not.
Before he was a career politician, Doug made big bucks as a criminal defense attorney. Doug and his partner, Tom Csider, worked diligently to get criminal charges reduced or dropped for violent criminals - specifically marketing their firm's services to murderers, rapists, child abusers and other heinous offenders. After they successfully got these criminals off the hook, many of their defendants went on to commit more crimes in communities across Georgia. Once again, Doug Collins has proven that he only plays a conservative on TV.

NEW AD EXPOSES DOUG COLLINS' DANGEROUS RECORD OF DEFENDING CRIMINALS
ATLANTA — Today, the Georgians for Kelly Loeffler campaign released a new ad exposing Doug Collins and his dangerous record of defending violent offenders in Georgia.
""As a criminal defense attorney, Doug Collins was putting his paycheck above the safety of Georgia families,” said Press Secretary Caitlin O'Dea. ""For years, his firm represented gang members, domestic abusers, and rapists. Collins and his law partner, Tom Csider, fought to keep these vile criminals in our communities and out of prison.
""Now, Doug Collins is a career politician who pretends to be a rock-solid, law and order conservative. He talks a good game on TV, but his dangerous record tells another story.
“Kelly Loeffler is a conservative businesswoman and political outsider who has fought in the U.S. Senate to protect funding for law enforcement. She’s tough on crime, proudly backs the blue, and wants violent criminals behind bars - where they belong.
“There's only one law and order candidate in this race - and that's obviously Kelly Loeffler.""

Kelly had another strong week, building tremendous momentum and closing out her All About Georgia Recess Tour by visiting with hundreds of Georgians from all over the state. On Monday, Kelly was joined by Governor Brian Kemp and Georgia First Lady Marty Kemp in Savannah, and then she finished the day in Dalton. On Tuesday, Kelly rolled out an all-star line-up of statewide elected officials to stump for her in Muscogee, Carroll and Fayette Counties.
Click the photo below to see a video message from Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, Attorney General Chris Carr, Insurance Commissioner John King and Public Service Commissioner Tim Echols encouraging voters to join them in supporting Kelly:
On Wednesday, Kelly was again joined by Governor Kemp, this time in Peachtree Corners, for a HUGE rally with a great group of supporters. On Thursday, U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) joined Kelly for her campaign stops in Gilmer, Forsyth and Hall Counties, explaining why Kelly is the tough-on-crime, tough-on-China, no-nonsense conservative Georgia needs in Washington.
In case you missed it, the Radical Left crashed Kelly's event in Forsyth County, opting for screaming and yelling instead of productive dialogue and a helpful exchange of ideas. This display perfectly explains the Left's vision for America: to silence anyone they disagree with. But Kelly will not be silenced. She will always fight for everyday Georgians and push back against this out-of-control cancel culture.
Click the photo below to see footage:
In addition to her tour, Kelly also stood up for conservative values on and off the campaign trail. On Monday, she slammed liberal puppet Raphael Warnock for twisting the gospel to justify the Left's immoral abortion-on-demand agenda. Kelly also condemned left-wing hypocrite Nancy Pelosi for her trip to the salon while everyday Americans are not afforded such a luxury. In a Breitbart op-ed, Kelly further denounced the BLM political organization, especially its anti-moms-and-dads agenda to destroy the nuclear family. She re-affirmed her rock-solid commitment to the men and women of law enforcement.
Finally, she continued to expose career politician Doug Collins for his 300+ votes with ""good friend"" Stacey Abrams and his votes for gun control, lighter sentences for violent criminals and his support for the ""largest tax increase in Georgia history.""

ICYMI: SENATOR LOEFFLER INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO CRACK DOWN ON GANGS
ATLANTA – Yesterday, conservative businesswoman and political outsider Kelly Loeffler introduced legislation to strengthen federal sentencing guidelines for gang-related crimes and create a nationwide database to track gang activity. In practice, the Cracking Down on Gangs and Deporting Criminals Act of 2020 would make it easier to put gang members behind bars by increasing sentences for gang-related crimes. It also increases the likelihood of deporting a gang member who is in the country illegally. Loeffler's legislation is endorsed by Governor Brian Kemp, Attorney General Chris Carr, and Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vic Reynolds.
""At a time when Democratic Mayors across the country are failing to stand up for the safety of our loved ones, we must take the lead and crack down on the dangerous gangs that are wreaking havoc on our communities,"" said Senator Loeffler. ""I'm proud to have the backing of so many strong leaders in law enforcement, who support my plan to increase punishments for criminal gang members and deport those gang members who are living in our country illegally. It's time we get back to being a nation of law and order - and that starts with getting tough on our country's worst offenders.""

TRIAL LAWYER DOUG COLLINS PROMISED TO ""SHOULDER THAT BURDEN"" FOR MURDERERS, RAPISTS, CHILD ABUSERS
ATLANTA - Before morphing into a full-time career politician, Doug Collins was a criminal defense attorney who put his paycheck above public safety. As a partner at Collins & Csider, Collins worked around the clock to keep his clients out of jail. The firm marketed their services directly to vile criminals online and promised to ""shoulder that burden"" for murderers, rapists and child abusers:
Collins came through for his criminal clients, successfully securing reduced or dismissed charges for several accused of armed robbery, kidnapping and aggravated assault. Several of Collins' most notorious criminal clients became repeat offenders.
""Doug Collins and his firm actively and aggressively marketed his legal services to some of Georgia's most dangerous and vile criminals,"" said Stephen Lawson, Communications Director. ""He was unapologetic in his pursuit of reduced sentencing for violent offenders who went on to commit more crimes and put Georgia families at risk.
""It’s clear that Kelly Loeffler is the only conservative in this race who can proudly stand with President Trump as he fights to restore law and order in America by putting dangerous criminals behind bars where they belong. Doug Collins would be better off running for Mayor of Portland or Chicago where his record of lawlessness would be applauded by the woke mob and liberal electorate.""
Background
Collins & Csider’s Website Marketed Its Services To Defendants Accused Of Felonies And Misdemeanors (Collins & Csider, Archived 8/12/15)
Collins & Csider Offered To Quash Prosecutions By “Talking To The Officers Involved In Arrest” And Persuading Prosecutors To Dismiss Cases Or Reduce Them To A Lesser Offense.” “Over the years, we have prevented cases from being filed by talking to the officers involved in arrest. We have also been successful in persuading prosecutors to dismiss cases or reduce them to a lesser offense by exposing the weakness of a case. So, you see, you never know what type of a positive outcome can be achieved with your case, unless you take the time to call us. Your first consultation is free, and in some cases I can meet you at a time and place that's convenient for you.” (Collins & Csider, Archived 8/12/15)
Collins & Csider Offered To “Defend False Allegations Of [Domestic] Abuse.” “Domestic violence includes both emotional and physical abuse, threats, stalking and similar mistreatment. Our lawyers can determine whether a Petition under the Family Violence Act is appropriate or whether a Restraining Order should be entered within the pending divorce action. We can also defend false allegations of abuse.” (Collins & Csider, Archived 8/12/15)
In June 2008, Collins Defended Jeremy Scroger, Shacara Rucker, Shinard Cook, Sidney Howell, And Siedah Smith On Charges Of Armed Robbery, Criminal Conspiracy, Two Kidnappings, Four Aggravated Assaults, And Theft. Rucker Was Also Charged With Possessing A Firearm For Use In A Crime; The Charge Was Eventually Dismissed. Scroger, Rucker, And Cook Were Found Guilty Of Criminal Conspiracy And Two Kidnappings, Though The Kidnappings Were Amended To Lighter Charges. The Armed Robbery, Aggravated Assault, And Theft Charges Against Scroger, Rucker, And Cook Were Dismissed. (Case No. 2009CR000650, Hall County Superior Court, Filed 6/30/08)
Rucker, Howell, And Smith Went On To Commit More Crimes, Including Battery, Theft, And Obstructing A Police Officer. (Case No. 2010SR000778, Hall County State Court, Filed 2/16/10; Case No. 2008SR005735, Hall County State Court, Filed 8/12/08; Hall County Courts, Accessed 2/5/20)
The Defendants Reportedly Robbed A McDonald’s Restaurant At Gunpoint, Forcing Employees Into A Walk-In Cooler. “Five people have been arrested in connection with the early morning armed robbery of a Flowery Branch McDonald’s restaurant, including an employee whom investigators believe was involved. Hall County Sheriff’s Col. Jeff Strickland said two females and two males were let into the restaurant at 3 a.m. Friday by an employee, supposedly to use the bathroom. One of the four suspects pulled out a small caliber handgun and forced two of the restaurant’s three employees into a walk-in cooler. The third employee opened the safe for the robbers and handed over an undisclosed amount of cash, Strickland said. No one was injured and the cooler was not locked…After questioning the employees, investigators determined that one of the McDonald’s workers, 24-year-old Jeremy Scroger, assisted in the robbery, Strickland said. After securing a search warrant, investigators recovered the handgun and the stolen money from the Mazda, Strickland said. Scroger was charged with armed robbery and kidnapping. Also charged with armed robbery and kidnapping were Sidney Lewis Howell, 17, Shinard Ryaston Cook, 18, Siedah Yasmeen Smith, 21, and Shacarra Rucker, 18.” (Stephen Gurr, “Five Are Arrested In McDonalds Robbery,” Gainesville Times, 5/29/09)

CRIMINALS FOR COLLINS: MEET DANNY CLORE
ATLANTA - Before he was a career politician, Doug Collins made big bucks as a criminal defense attorney. Doug and his partner, Tom Csider, worked diligently to get criminal charges reduced or dropped for violent criminals - including illegal immigrants, sex offenders, drug dealers, and other heinous offenders. After they successfully freed these criminals, many of their defendants went on to commit more crimes in communities across Georgia.
Today, let's take a closer look at Danny Clore - one of the criminals Doug worked to free, and the inaugural member of the Criminals for Collins Coalition.
In 2009, Doug defended Danny Clore on charges of meth distribution and marijuana possession. The meth charge was dismissed, and the marijuana charge was discharged (thanks, Doug!). Unfortunately, Danny went on to commit more crimes, including aggravated assault, illegal possession of a firearm and obstructing a police officer. In 2015, Danny led the police on a high-speed chase after shooting at two vehicles with passengers inside. When the police finally caught and arrested Danny, he was found in possession of meth.
Obviously, Danny Clore should never have been on the streets. But thanks to Doug Collins, Danny slipped justice to commit more crimes and put Georgia families at risk.
In the race for the U.S. Senate, it's clear that Georgians cannot trust D.C. Doug to keep them safe. There's only one law-and-order conservative in this race, and that's Kelly Loeffler.
Background
In July 2009, Collins Defended Danny Clore On Charges Of Methamphetamine Distribution And Misdemeanor Possession Of Marijuana. (Case No. 2009CR000723, Hall County Superior Court, Filed 7/17/09)
The Meth Distribution Charge Was Dismissed While The Marijuana Charge Was Conditionally Discharged. (Case No. 2009CR000723, Hall County Superior Court, Filed 7/17/09)
Clore Went On To Commit More Crimes, Including Aggravated Assault, Illegal Possession Of A Firearm, And Obstructing A Police Officer. (Hall County Courts, Accessed 2/5/20)
Clore Led Police On A High-Speed Chase In 2015 After Shooting At Two Vehicles With Occupants Inside Them; Meth Was Found On His Person When He Was Arrested. “A Gainesville man wanted in Hall County in connection with a shooting was arrested Saturday after dogs and deputies tracked him through the woods of Rabun County. ‘We continued tracking (Danny Ray Clore) and later located a camo (waterproof) box that contained drugs and other .380 magazines,’ according to the report. ‘Minutes later (Clore) was located hiding behind a large log on the ground…’ Deputies responded to that incident around 1:30 p.m. to reports of someone ‘firing rounds from an automatic weapon,’ Hall County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Deputy Nicole Bailes said. ‘Clore shot at two vehicles that each had two occupants inside the vehicles at the time of the incident,’ Bailes wrote in an email… Officers chased Clore, who reportedly was ‘weaving in and out and traveling at a high rate of speed...’ ‘(The officer) then searched in the leaves where (Clore) was laying and located a Ruger .380 pistol and a Ziploc bag containing what appeared to (be) methamphetamine,’ according to the report. He was charged with possession of methamphetamine, fleeing and eluding by the Rabun County Sheriff’s Office.” (Nick Watson, “Authorities: Gainesville Shooting Suspect Captured After Chase Through Woods,” Gainesville Times, 11/23/15)

886,"Friend,
After another fantastic week, it's obvious: Kelly Loeffler is Georgia's choice for conservative leadership in the United States Senate. It's clear that families across our state want a businessperson and a political outsider they can trust to deliver results and take on the Radical Left and D.C. Swamp.
On Tuesday, a new poll showed Kelly with a decisive lead in her race. The poll, which was conducted last week, shows Senator Loeffler leading with 26%, followed by Doug Collins at 17% and Raphael Warnock at 17%. In major news, Senator Loeffler also leads Collins among Republicans by 18% and by 25% among Trump voters. To view the full poll results, click HERE.
Kelly also had a great time meeting with supporters at the grand opening of her Athens Field Office. She was joined by Georgia Insurance Commissioner John King – one of the several statewide elected officials who have endorsed her campaign for Senate. After the grand opening, Kelly spoke to packed houses at monthly meetings of the Athens-Clarke and Walton County Republican Parties. Click HERE to see photos from the Athens Field Office grand opening.
On Thursday, Kelly was joined for a visit to the Georgia Cyber Center in Augusta by yet another high-profile, statewide official: Georgia First Lady Marty Kemp. Kelly and Marty toured the facilities, met with local professional leaders, and were briefed on Georgia's investment into the Center and its impact on economic development and the cybersecurity workforce.
Kelly and Marty also discussed curbing sex trafficking in Georgia, as well as Augusta University’s efforts to combat the coronavirus. They emphasized the University's telehealth program and the state and federal funding it has received as a result of three letters Kelly wrote to the Federal Communications Commission.
With all the work she's doing for Georgia, it's no wonder Kelly has earned the support of Georgia's grassroots conservatives. Just this week, Kelly was widely praised when she publicly demanded answers from Planned Parenthood regarding their PPP loan abuse and heinous sale of baby body parts. She won support from gun owners and gun rights interest groups like AmmoLand – which stated that ""Second Amendment supporters should keep Loeffler in [the Senate]."" She also took a strong stand with President Trump in support of the SEC's decision to let college football players participate in the 2020 season.
With these strong conservative credentials, it's no wonder she was the ONLY U.S. Senator to receive a PERFECT, 100-percent score on Heritage Action for America’s legislative scorecard for the 116th Congress – making her the most conservative U.S. senator. It's also worth noting that Kelly holds a perfect, 100-percent record of voting with President Trump.
And in case you missed it, Kelly also appeared on Fox News recently to praise President Trump’s executive action to help American workers and families. As Kelly said:
“The President is truly a man of his word. He wants to make sure we don’t have blue-state bailouts, we want to get back to the blue-collar boom that he built in the last three years of this economy, and we know we can get back there and do it safely. But we can’t advance the radical agenda that they propose, where their package mentions cannabis 20 times more than it mentions jobs.”
Click HERE or on the photo below to watch the full interview.
Finally, after Sleepy Joe Biden announced Phony Kamala Harris as his nominee for vice president, Kelly hammered Kamala's socialist policies, exposed Twitter for hiring Kamala's former press secretary and slammed Kamala for helping to free criminal defendants charged with murder, violent felonies and sex crimes.
If that seems familiar, it's probably because Doug Collins spent years doing the same thing. Both Doug and Kamala are soft on crime, and they put the interests of violent criminals over those of hardworking Americans. But that's not the only way these two are similar. Like Phony Kamala Harris, D.C. Doug is a career politician who will say or do anything to climb the political ladder. Even though Doug and Kamala share a striking resemblance, we will not let Georgia become the new California. Kelly will always support law enforcement, crack down on gangs, and support President Trump as he restores law and order and keeps America safe.
For daily and hourly updates, please be sure to follow Kelly on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. If you have any questions for the campaign, would like to volunteer, would like to request campaign signs or bumper stickers, or if you would like to invite Kelly to attend an event, please email [[URL REDACTED]] To sign up for email updates from the campaign, click HERE.

Kelly Loeffler
Alex,
American cities are under siege.
Radical liberal policies and their advocates have enabled and emboldened rioters. They have undermined the strength of our police forces. They have turned a blind eye to the violent crime surging in major cities all across our country.
We cannot allow communities, businesses, and lives to be threatened. We must support those who will do what it takes to keep Americans safe.
That’s why it’s more important than ever to send Kelly back to Washington.
Since taking her Oath of Office in January, she’s made keeping us safe her number one priority.
Kelly has pushed anti-gang legislation that would help us keep violent criminals off the street, fought back against every attempt to defund the brave men and women in law enforcement, and called out the radical left for their dangerous and irresponsible attacks on the rule of law.
Support Kelly and help her keep Americans safe —>
You can trust Kelly to protect us, but you can’t trust Doug Collins.
D.C. Doug Collins has been putting Georgians at risk his entire career.
In the Georgia State House, he partnered with Stacey Abrams to reduce sentences for violent offenders and tried to raise fees on firearm licenses in Georgia — hurting our ability to defend ourselves. And as a defense attorney, Doug made his living putting dangerous and violent criminals back on the streets - and many broke the law again!
Support Kelly and help her keep Americans safe —>
We need leaders who know what it takes to keep our communities safe and who won’t back down in the face of the mob and their dangerous policies.
Alex, that’s Kelly.
Thank you for your support,

With less than 60 days until Election Day, liberals are getting desperate.
They’re pouring millions into Georgia to push their radical agenda on all of us.
But here’s the thing: I know we can defeat their Washington mega-donors if we just work together. That’s why I’m asking every Georgia conservative to give just $5 for Kelly before 11:59PM on September 12th — our mid-month deadline.

But if we want to defeat the extremists who are working hard to:
* defund our police
* ship American jobs overseas
* open our borders
* and coddle China (even in this pandemic!)
Then we’re going to need every Georgian to put just a little skin in the game and show their support for Kelly.

KL
Alex,
Kelly Loeffler is a conservative businesswoman and political outsider who has delivered results for hardworking Georgians and advanced our conservative agenda in the United States Senate.
In the 10 months she has served in the Senate, Kelly has achieved more for Georgia families than most career politicians accomplish in 10 years.
As one of her first actions, Kelly introduced legislation to protect innocent life, and she has proven herself a relentless advocate for the unborn. She is endorsed by every major pro-life organization in America, including the National Right to Life, Susan B. Anthony List, and Family Policy Alliance.
Kelly is also fighting around the clock to protect our 2nd-Amendment rights, take care of our veterans, hold Big Tech accountable for their censorship of conservative speech, and notably, Kelly cast one of the deciding votes to acquit President Trump during the sham impeachment.
Donate and Vote Tuesday, November 3
In Washington, Kelly took a firm stance in support of our police and against the dangerous “defund the police” movement. In fact, Kelly has introduced legislation to defund cities that defund their police, crack down on gangs and illegal immigration, and to make looting small businesses a federal crime.
Kelly has stood with President Trump to restore law and order, and she will always back the blue.
When the pandemic hit, Kelly played a critical role in securing grants and funding for Georgia farmers, infrastructure, and rural hospitals. She was instrumental in passing the CARES Act to deliver PPP loans to boost struggling small businesses. Importantly, Kelly has also taken strong action to hold China accountable for spreading the virus.
Unfortunately, Doug Collins has manufactured lies about Kelly, because he’s trying to run from his failed record as a career politician. We all know that Doug Collins is part of the Swamp establishment that Kelly went to Washington to drain. Doug has a long history of siding with liberals like Stacey Abrams and Nancy Pelosi to raise taxes, weaken the 2nd Amendment, and fund amnesty, sanctuary cities, and Common Core.
That’s not the kind of “conservative” we need representing us in the Senate.
You can find all of the information—and facts—on that HERE. And perhaps the most useful tool to share with family, friends, and neighbors who are undecided is this informative link that compares Kelly’s record of accomplishments to Doug’s record of failures: [[URL REDACTED]]
Kelly Loeffler is the pro-life, pro-Trump, pro-wall, and pro-gun conservative businesswoman and political outsider Georgia families can trust.
She is the only candidate in her race that has taken on – and defeated – the Swamp, the special interests, and the radical cancel culture. On November 3, the choice is clear: please VOTE Kelly Loeffler for U.S. Senate.
Donate and Vote Tuesday, November 3

Kelly Loeffler
Alex,
Don’t let Doug Collins fool you. He’s not who you think he is.
Doug Collins is NOT a conservative — he only plays one when the cameras are on.
He says he stands with President Trump and fights for conservative causes, but a close look at his record in Atlanta and in Washington D.C. proves that he’s all talk.
There are no results, only rhetoric.
Get the truth about Doug Collins
As a state representative, Doug Collins worked hand-in-hand with Stacey Abrams to raise taxes on Georgia families and businesses — tax-hikes that were vetoed every single time.
His time in Washington has been more of the same. Do these look like conservative votes to you?
* He supported billions in new tax increases and all of Obama’s budgets.
* He voted to fund Planned Parenthood three times.
* He worked with radical Democrats to free violent felons and fund sanctuary cities. He has repeatedly proven that he’s weak on crime and illegal immigration.
Get the truth about Doug Collins
Doug Collins talks a big game about fighting for President Trump’s agenda, but he refused to say if he would even vote for the President the day before the 2016 Republican National Convention and has a history of praising Senator Mitt Romney, who voted to impeach President Trump.
Georgians can’t trust Doug Collins. Period.
Don’t let him fool you anymore — find out who Doug Collins really is.

Alex,
We’re just hours away from the last mid-month deadline of this election cycle and we wanted to reach out again and ask if you can chip in just $10 before midnight?
URGENT: CHIP IN $10 >>
As you know, Kelly is counting on Georgians like you to help as she fights for free speech, stops the left-wing mob, and protects our communities from crime and violence.
And we can’t fight back against the big-spending liberals alone. We need conservatives like you standing with us.
But right now, we’re still $2,003 away from our goal and we just can’t afford to come up short, Alex.
Can we count on you to come through for Kelly and donate $10 today?: [[URL REDACTED]]
Thanks for all that you do.

Alex,
Democrats are getting desperate.
They’re going all out, spending money like crazy, trying to push their liberal agenda on all of us. Alex, we need them to know it’s not going to work. They’re not going to BUY this election!
That’s why we need YOUR help to meet our FINAL Mid-Month fundraising goal by 11:59PM TOMORROW.
Can you chip in now?
By donating below, you are making an immediate contribution:
ONE CLICK DONATE: $100
ONE CLICK DONATE: $75
ONE CLICK DONATE: $50
ONE CLICK DONATE: $25
If you've saved payment information with Revv or WinRed, your donation will go through automatically.
If we reach this goal, we can defeat the extremists who are working hard to:
* defund our police
* take our guns
* open our borders
* and coddle China (even in this pandemic!)
But the new numbers we checked this morning show us $6,522 short!
So, if you can, please chip in before 11:59PM tomorrow to show your support for Senator Loeffler, it would be a GREAT help!: [[URL REDACTED]]
Don’t forget, Alex, this is the final stretch. Your support counts now, more than ever.

Kelly Loeffler for Senate
Alex,
Last week, the woke mob tried to cancel Kelly for standing up to the radical left and defending the American flag.
But Kelly didn’t blink, and she’s not going to let the radical left stop her from doing her job and keeping Americans safe.
A poll last week showed that voters think cancel culture is going too far and that Americans aren’t going to stand for this kind of character assassination.
Alex, it’s simple — voters don’t want leaders who back down to the left. They want leaders who will stand up to the mob and do what it takes to protect their families and communities.
And that leader is Kelly.
She just introduced a bill that would make it easier for our law enforcement agencies to take gang members off the streets and create a federal database of gang activity within the Department of Justice.
Donate and become a citizen cosponsor
Kelly is acknowledging a simple truth — that gang violence is destroying lives, families, and communities across America.
According to experts, there are more than a million gang members in America and gangs currently pose the greatest public safety threat to American citizens.
Kelly’s bill would help law enforcement agencies coordinate and work together to keep Americans safe from gang violence and prosecute the perpetrators of it. It’s a simple, commonsense law that will help keep us safe from the violence plaguing our country.
Donate below and become a citizen cosponsor.

Kelly Loeffler
Alex,
This is huge news.
Sheriffs throughout Georgia just endorsed Kelly and denounced Doug Collins for being weak on crime and putting communities at risk.
“Kelly Loeffler has proven that she will stand with our law enforcement community to protect Georgia families and communities. Doug Collins has made a career out of putting the interests of criminals before the safety of Georgia’s families...Georgia needs a leader who will always stand up for law and order — not violent criminals – which is why we’re proud to endorse Kelly Loeffler for United States Senate."" - Georgia’s Sheriffs
Join them in endorsing Kelly
Kelly has been fighting to keep our communities safe since she stepped foot on the Senate floor, and she’s had the back of law enforcement every step of the way.
She’s the only law and order candidate in our race and that’s just a fact. Just take a look at her record compared to Doug Collins.
Doug has been weak on crime his entire career. Instead of working with law enforcement to keep our communities safe, he worked with Stacey Abrams to shorten prison sentences for violent criminals.
As a criminal defense attorney, he put families, businesses, and communities at risk by putting dangerous offenders back on the streets.
Kelly’s record on crime couldn’t be more different than Doug’s.
She’s protected law enforcement budgets from the radical left’s dangerous attempts to defund the police every step of the way. Just last week, she introduced a bill to help law enforcement crackdown on criminal gang activity and keep dangerous criminals away from our communities and behind bars.
Keeping Americans safe is Kelly’s number one priority, and her record proves how serious she is.

Kelly Loeffler for Senate
Alex,
The violence that Atlanta witnessed over the July 4th weekend is tragic, inexcusable, and worst of all — avoidable.
I’m heartbroken, and frankly, furious. The loss of life is horrific on any occasion, and even more gut-wrenching when the victim is young a child.
We cannot continue to allow our communities to suffer. We must reject the radical left and their “Defund Police” movement. We must stand with law enforcement and protect Georgia families from crime and violence.
I encourage you to read my full response to the lawlessness in Atlanta and join me in solemn prayer for those who lost their lives.

897,"Yoho's top aide Kat Cammack is running on attacking AOC. You can help us defeat her. View this email in your browser
Alex,
When Ted Yoho verbally assaulted AOC in public, many Republicans criticized him and urged him to apologize.
Not Kat Cammack, the retiring Yoho’s former campaign manager, chief of staff, and now anointed successor. Asked by journalists, Cammack repeatedly refused to say even one critical word of Yoho’s vile misogyny.
Instead, she followed his boss’s lead and ramped up her own attacks on AOC. She called AOC an “extremist,” and started vowing to “go up against AOC” and “fight the Squad” on a daily basis.
Chip in to help us defeat Yoho’s protege Kat Cammack and flip FL-3 >>
A few days ago, Cammack won the Republican nomination to succeed her boss. In her victory speech, she boasted again,
“We are going to go toe-to-toe with AOC,”
and told Trump,
“You have reinforcements on the way, sir.”
As if those weren’t enough, she went further to make this graphic and posted it all over her social media:
Fight back against Yoho and Cammack’s craven attacks on AOC––help us beat Cammack in November.
Cammack’s non-stop, obsessive attacks on AOC and the Squad are outrageous. But sadly, they’re every bit as predictable.
For 8 years, Yoho and his machine have run our district. As Yoho’s top lieutenant, Cammack knows she can’t campaign on Yoho’s “legacy”––one that consists of being 1 of 4 votes against making lynching a federal crime, opposing the Civil Rights Act, siding with corporations and billionaires over working people, and cheerleading Trump’s hateful immigration agenda from day one.
Just like her boss, Cammack has nothing to offer working people in our district, who are hit hard by the pandemic and suffering from severe job losses. So instead, she’s campaigning on fear mongering about young, progressive women of color in Congress.
Yoho and Cammack’s playbook might have worked in the past. But this year, we have an alternative.
For the first time in years, our people-powered campaign has energized Democrats, young people, and working people throughout the district with a message of Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and real criminal justice reforms. United as a party, we are ready to turn Florida blue and win the seat back from Yoho and his machine.
If you’re outraged by Yoho and Cammack’s craven attacks on AOC, please chip in to help us defeat them and turn the seat blue in November.
Thanks for joining our fight,
Adam

View this email in your browser
Alex,
I’m SO PROUD to share with you that our grassroots campaign to replace Ted Yoho just got endorsed by United We Dream, the largest immigrant youth-led community in the country!
Stand with immigrant youth and Adam: chip in to help us replace Ted Yoho>>
From protecting DACA, to fighting ICE’s blatant abuse of human rights, to winning education access for immigrants, UWD has helped lead the fight for immigration justice. Their 400,000 members have put their bodies on the line to defend immigrants’ rights and stop unjust deportations.
That’s why I’m especially humbled by UWD’s faith in our youth-led campaign to fight for a Florida where all immigrants can live healthy and fulfilling lives without the fear of deportation, detention, family separation, or death.
You may know Rep. Ted Yoho as the misogynist who verbally assaulted AOC without a shred of remorse, or as 1 of only 4 people in Congress to vote against making lynching a federal crime. But as one of Trump’s closest allies in Congress, he’s also championed Trump’s hateful immigration agenda since day one.
Yoho cheerled Trump’s wall, proudly and unconditionally supports ICE and its concentration camps, applauded Trump’s gutting of DACA, and helped flame Trump’s fearmongering over immigrant caravans. He’s a threat to immigrant families’ safety and wellbeing not just in our district in Florida, but across the nation.
Chip in $17 today to help us replace him & flip FL-3 in November.
Our campaign is proud to stand with immigrant youth and fight for comprehensive, humane reforms that protect and uplift immigrant families. With your help, we will replace Trump minion Ted Yoho and take the fight for immigration justice to Congress.
In solidarity,
Adam

Patriot,
Far-left, socialist politicians pose an existential threat to the future of America.
All across the United States, we’ve seen failed leadership from liberal politicians lead to bending the knee to the Antifa mob instead of standing up to violent rioters and looters.
If the radical left gains any more power in November, we can expect even more of this lawlessness. Far-left politicians will push for open borders and defunding the police, and this crime, chaos, and destruction will spread to every corner of the country.
CLICK HERE TO STOP THE FAR-LEFT AGENDA
I’m running for Congress to stop this, defend our great president, and fight back against AOC’s socialist mob (and their best friends in the fake news media).
I’m asking for you to support my mission before midnight tonight to help my team reach our end-of-month goal in the fight against this extremism.
I stand with the Keep America Great agenda of President Trump, and if elected to Congress, I will be his #1 Fighter on the mission to restore Law and Order in our streets.
Help me accomplish this mission by pitching in today!
PITCH IN $5
PITCH IN $20.20 TO WIN IN 2020

901,"Friend,
Again last night, Bernie Sanders refused to condemn Cuba.
Look at the record of the dictator he has repeatedly praised:
* Tens of thousands murdered, summarily executed for opposing the regime.
* Hundreds of thousands more sent to gulags and re-education camps.
* An untold number – estimated in the tens of thousands – lost at sea in desperate attempts to escape on makeshift rafts.
That’s just the beginning. Sanders has had a lifelong friendship with Nicaraguan strongman Daniel Ortega, a man responsible for mass murder and the wholesale persecution of political prisoners. Sanders honeymooned in the Soviet Union – a regime responsible for as many as 50 million deaths through political assassination, gulags, and state-sponsored genocide.
We knew this day was coming.
For decades, our colleges and universities have served to indoctrinate generations of students, assuring them that the Cold War was simply a misunderstanding between two super powers that were equally at fault. For decades, our press covered up the crimes of the socialists, lauding the likes of Castro.
Their work has brought us here: This is the new face of the Democrat Party – an avowed socialist selling misery and yet hailed by the younger generation as a prophet.
It falls on us to end this – to beat back this socialist attack on America. We have the right message and it is time we change the messenger.
That is my mission: To speak clearly and unequivocally against socialism. To stand up for the values that have made America great: liberty, opportunity, capitalism, and limited, Constitutional government.
That is my pledge to you.
As both a woman and a millennial, I will take on the radical liberals like AOC, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib. No one will be a tougher critic of their outrageous and dangerous policies than me. More than ever we need a strong voice for common sense, liberty, and young conservatives across America.
I hope you will consider supporting my campaign for Congress with a financial contribution.
Thank you,

Vote Republican & Keep our Freedoms!
This Sunday, while putting out signs, we saw an awesome sign that said:
﻿""Remember when you vote for any Democrat for President or Congress is a vote for: open borders, sanctuary cities, free health care for illegals, gun confiscation, late term abortions, higher taxes, government health care, more crime, more corruption, and more socialism. Vote Republican and let's keep our freedoms!""
Building Team Kat
This week, Mike Weeks, NRA Certified trainer, endorsed our campaign!

With our brave men and women in uniform facing cuts across our country, they need our support now more than ever.
Our police, firefighters, EMTs, and public defenders across the country risk their lives every day to keep all of us safe. Without them, our communities would face insecurity and high crime.

No one understands this more than Kat. Her priority is to keep our communities safe, our borders secure, and our businesses growing. Kat is an advocate for safety and security and she stands with our officers.

In early 2018, Russia attacked American troops in Syria. According to The New York Times, between 200-300 pro-Syrian fighters, including Russian mercenaries, were killed during the 4-hour battle.
That was my husband's unit.
Last night, I learned that as retaliation, Russia is working with the Taliban and offering bounties on the heads of American troops. And the Commander in Chief has known this for months--and did nothing to protect the lives of deployed service members.
This is not the first time the President of the United States has viewed service members as collateral damage. What I have witnessed as an Army wife for several years now is simple. Donald Trump is a national security threat.
After Russia shot at American soldiers in Syria, our President shook hands with Vladimir Putin. And chose to ignore the warnings and expertise of career intelligence officials when they reported that Russia was working to undermine America through cyber warfare.
After Russia shot at American soldiers in Syria, our President chose to abandon the allies who stood alongside American troops. He opened the gates of slaughter. He allowed Turkey to enact a mass genocide on the Kurdish people. American troops remained in the region, without Rules of Engagement orders--while Turkey shot at them.
After Russia shot at American soldiers in Syria, our President continued to rent out our men and women in uniform like for-hire mercenaries to Saudi Arabia.
After Russia shot at American soldiers in Syria, our President had a foreign leader assassinated in a foreign country, while American troops remained in country. As retaliation for our actions, Iran attacked our troops in Iraq, leaving 109 service members with brain injuries.
After Russia shot at American soldiers in Syria, our President violated federal law and the United States Constitution by illegally withholding aid to Ukraine, which was a benefit to Russia.
After Russia shot at American soldiers in Syria, our President agreed to withdraw troops from Germany, which was a benefit to Russia.
Russia benefits when Americans are unprepared to combat cyber warfare. Russia benefits when America creates a vacuum in Syria. Russia benefits when American soldiers are seen as for-profit mercenaries instead of defenders of democracy. Russia benefits from a US-Iran showdown. Russia benefits from a weakened Ukraine and destabilized Europe.
The President of the United States has committed multiple war crimes. He has committed multiple acts of treason.
I am formally calling on every Member of Congress to denounce the most recent behavior by the President.
This includes Senator Roy Blunt, Senator Josh Hawley, and Representative Vicky Hartzler, who must fulfill their Constitutional duty to hold the executive branch accountable for undermining the integrity and stability of these United States.
Can you help us by sending them an email below?

905,"Good afternoon,
Last night, the volunteer team had a thoughtful discussion about ways to reach out to voters other than social media and phone calls. I agreed to provide some information, and I encourage all of you to use and share with your personal networks as you see fit. The following email and attachments contain background information on Michelle and the race, as well as print materials and video links.
BACKGROUND ON MAYOR DE LA ISLA
Michelle has served Kansas families her entire career, but her journey into public service was not easy. Michelle has overcome poverty, domestic violence, and cancer – all while taking care of her children as a single mother.
After graduating from Wichita State University, Michelle moved to Topeka and taught financial literacy, built homes with Habitat for Humanity, and participated in the Capital District Group that revitalized downtown Topeka. Michelle was elected to the Topeka City Council in 2013, and elected Mayor of Topeka in 2017. As mayor, Michelle has worked to create hundreds of jobs, increase funds to fix roads, open a new tech school, and reduce violent crime.
Mayor De La Isla has also received national attention for her leadership on how she has approached Covid-19 preparation and response in Topeka. Here is a link to a CNN feature about how she has stepped up during the crisis: Michelle on CNN.
Please also see the attached article, ""A Candidate on Our Watch List"" to learn more about Michelle's incredible story of overcoming hardship and her dedication to serving Kansas families.
THE RACE
We are extremely proud that we outraised our Republican opponents in both the 1st and 2nd Quarters of 2020. What's more - Democrats only lost this seat by only 2,239 votes in 2018 \- less than 1% of the vote! But - with the help of Democrats in Kansas and around the country, we know we can finally flip this seat and send a message that supporting Trump is not in the best interest of Americans. Period.
Mayor De La Isla has been endorsed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC),  EMILY's List, End Citizens United, the League of Conservation Voters, three former presidential candidates, the Kansas and National Education Association, and several labor unions - with certainly more to come. She was also recently added to the DCCC's Red to Blue Program, which means she is one of 30 races the nation believes has the chance to unseat an incumbent.

906,"Alex,
Unacceptable—those are my thoughts on this decision. Today, the Senate voted to acquit President Trump of the high crimes of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress—leaving a stain on the fabric of our country.
Last year, my colleagues and I in the US House of Representatives voted to formally impeach the President when it became clear he jeopardized our democracy and abused the power of the highest office for his own personal gain. The Senate decision sets a dangerous precedent for future leaders and their accountability, when they know partisan politics play a bigger role than protecting our democracy.
The House will continue to fight to administer the proper oversight over this Administration and preserve the strength of our Democracy.
Can I count on you to help us?

Wendy Davis for Congress
Friend, more than 6,000 Texans have already lost their lives to COVID-19. Last week, FEMA refrigerator trucks were delivered here because many of our morgues have run out of room to store the bodies of those who have lost their battle with this devastating virus. This is the very definition of a crisis, and it's happening here in our own backyard.
And yet what has Donald Trump's response been? Attacking the person actually trying to do something about it.
Dr. Anthony Fauci has been telling us hard truths since the start of this pandemic. He's the guy that puts science first – and he's not afraid to stand up to this administration when they're behaving in ways that put our lives in danger.
But Trump has repeatedly denied the science and discredited Dr. Fauci. Worse still? He's got rank-and-file Republicans like Chip Roy backing him up. Chip went on the offensive against a Republican congresswoman who spoke out in support of Dr. Fauci – as if trusting one of the world's experts on infectious diseases is some sort of political crime.
This is a pandemic, not political theater. So I'm calling on Donald Trump and Chip Roy to depoliticize this crisis and stop the attacks on Dr. Fauci – and I'm asking 585 concerned people like you to join me before midnight tonight.
Add your name right now: Tell Donald Trump and Chip Roy to stop the attacks on Dr. Fauci!

NOW: Trump is SHAKING at the idea of being impeached by House Democrats again. This would totally RUIN his evil Supreme Court plans!
Trump has committed so many impeachable crimes this year alone -- from intentionally covering up the COVID-19 outbreak to kidnapping peaceful protestors.
He deserves to be impeached so Amy Coney Barrett can be BLOCKED! This could change EVERYTHING!

We’re up against a candidate whose record proves he’s not in this fight for the families of our community -- and we must fight back.
Troy Nehls is a former police officer with a long record of misconduct, from being discharged for mishandling evidence to lying about being charged with a crime in a sworn statement. He’s attacked survivors of sex trafficking and downplayed and denied the existence of coronavirus even as his own employeers got sick -- and he’s proven eager to become a mouthpiece of Washington special interests and gut health care for millions of families across this state.
Sri Preston Kulkarni is a lifelong public servant and diplomat who knows firsthand what it’s like to nearly go broke from our broken health care system. He’s in this fight to stand for working families in our district and expand access to affordable care, not gut it.
That’s the clear choice we’ll be facing in this election.

Barr just intervened in the sentencing of one of Trump’s closest campaign strategists: Roger Stone.
Career prosecutors recommended that Stone go to jail for 7-9 years for crimes he committed during the 2016 Presidential Election.
But William Barr intervened after Trump tweeted about how “unfair” it was.
This isn’t a movie. This isn’t an autocracy. The Attorney General must have forgotten that this is the United States, and we respect justice.

Jacob Blake is innocent. But that didn’t stop Kenosha police officers from shooting him 7 times in the back for no reason.

JUSTICE FOR JACOB BLAKE: DEMAND THE POLICE CHIEF AND SHERIFF RESIGN IMMEDIATELY >>
justice must be served.
Jacob Blake was shot 7 times in the back while getting into his car. He was shot in front of his three small children. He spent the following days in the hospital fighting for his life.
“Dismantling systemic racism in our nation starts with demanding justice & holding offenders accountable.”
\-- Kamala Harris
Jacob Blake is innocent. But his innocence couldn’t protect him from the horrors of police brutality. Just like it couldn’t protect George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and countless more.
What makes this all even worse is that Kenosha cops were seen cozying up to white supremacists in the ensuing protests. Their racism runs deep.
We know that as long as Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis and Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth remain in their positions, there will NEVER be justice for David Blake.
So we’re calling for their immediate resignation in protest of racist police brutality.
We won’t rest until these offenders are held accountable for their crime. Sign on to demand the police chief and sheriff in Kenosha RESIGN →

927,"Review Trump's presidency
Trump Presidential Review
**RESPONSE DUE BY 8 A.M. TOMORROW**
Click here take your Trump Presidential Review Survey >>
Survey registered to [[EMAIL_REDACTED]] to represent Houston. Please complete within 30 minutes of opening. Redistribution is strictly prohibited.
Trump’s presidency is defined by blatant racism, gross negligence, corruption, and betrayal.
It’s been called the “worst in modern history.”
So we’re working overtime to make sure he’s a single-term president.
And as an elite Texas Democrat, we’re eagerly awaiting your survey response. It’ll have huge implications on our 2020 strategy.
So please don’t wait. It should only take a moment. Submit your Trump Presidential Review Survey immediately >>
Complete the survey now >>
It has been a long and hard few years, so here’s a refresher on the crimes and atrocities Trump committed as President:
□ Ordered violence against peaceful protestors.
□ FIRED the White House Pandemic Response Team.
□ Separated innocent immigrant families and put children in cages.
□ Implemented a racist travel ban against Muslims.
We’re doing EVERYTHING we can to make Trump a one-term president and end his hateful agenda, but without your survey response, we’ll fail.
We’re not asking much of you. It’ll take only a moment and will have a huge impact on our 2020 strategy. Please respond now >>
Complete the survey now >>

\-- He called African nations “sh*thole countries”
\-- He’s told Black Congresswomen to “go back to the crime-infested places of which they came”
\-- And he won’t do ANYTHING to stop police brutality.
So we’re launching a campaign to END Trump’s racist attacks. If we can raise $45,000 this week, Trump will see our strength and shut his mouth. Donate $5 to stop Trump’s racist attacks right now >>
For decades, Black Americans have risked everything to fight for equality.
That fight is FAR from over.
Police are still taking innocent Black lives.
And Trump won’t do anything to help. He’ll just spew racist lies.
The President will not do the right thing unless will force him. We need $45,000 to fund our campaigns. Every dollar will go to electing Black Democrats who will stand up to Trump’s racism.
But if we miss this goal, Trump will continue to ignore us.
So please, don’t wait another minute. Rush $5 to end Trump’s racist and bigoted attacks on Black Americans >>

939,"His name is Jacob Blake. His crime? Being a Black man in America.
Last night, two police officers shot Jacob Blake multiple times as he was getting into his car. They shot him in front of his three small children. Now, he’s fighting for his life.
This is unacceptable. Being Black in America shouldn’t be a death sentence. It was for George Floyd. It was for Breonna Taylor. And now Jacob Blake could be the latest victim at the hands of police violence.
Our thoughts and prayers are with Jacob Blake as he fights for his life, as well as with his family and three small children. We are working hard to demand justice for Jacob Blake.

Breonna Taylor
But Breonna was murdered by the Louisville Police Department at her home while sleeping. They barged in without identifying themselves to look for drugs that were never found and for a person who did not even reside in Breonna’s residence.

The only person who was charged was Breonna’s boyfriend, who shot at the door in self-defense when the officers refused to identify themselves.

Jacob Blake was shot in front of his three small children. He spent the following days in the hospital fighting for his life. He’s paralyzed.
“Dismantling systemic racism starts with demanding justice and holding offenders accountable. Based on what I've seen, it seems the officer should be charged.”
Kamala Harris
Jacob Blake is innocent. But his innocence couldn’t protect him from the horrors of police brutality. Just like it couldn’t protect George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and countless more.
What makes this all even worse is that Kenosha cops were seen cozying up to white supremacists in the ensuing protests. Their racism runs deep.
So we’re standing with Biden and Harris to DEMAND the officer who shot Blake be charged.

We need to win nine races to flip the Texas House
We have 22 opportunities to do so. And if we do, then we can change Texas politics for a decade.
Imagine the impact of a progressive Texas Legislature leading redistricting. That means expanding Medicaid, increasing funding for public schools, using the Texas Rainy Day Fund to help every day Texans, and more.
We can do it. Many of these seats overlap several counties so if you live in a red, blue, or purple county at the presidential level - every vote counts at the legislative level!

# More Progress
Whether Dan Patrick agrees or not, it is time to take down Confederate monuments across Texas.
This week the RNC featured one of Trump’s favorite congressmen, Dan Crenshaw. We didn’t want to hear from him, so we gave the spotlight to his progressive challenger, Sima Ladjevardian.
Gov. Abbott was right to expand early vote by a week, but now Republicans are suing to take it away. Even when they get something right, they find a way to screw it up!
There has been a 700% increase in crimes committed by White House advisors during Trump Administration. Putting him in charge for “law and order” is like asking the wolf to guard the sheep.
Progress Texas is looking for a communications intern to join our team for the fall semester. Interns will receive $15/hour and the position is remote. Apply today!

Trump thinks Democrats will ignore his crimes. So we’re asking 75,000 Democrats to PROVE HIM WRONG by 9AM tomorrow:

Trump can’t be allowed to break the law again and again.
But right now, Trump and his lawyers are IGNORING the law - this is a CRYSTAL-CLEAR violation of the Constitution!
Trump knows: if his Tax Returns are released, he’d NEVER win another term. So it’ll take a massive wave of Democrats to force his hand.
Only a rush 75,000 Democrats can FORCE Trump’s secrets into the open.

Trump pays almost NO taxes. Hard working Americans cover the bill.

Donald Trump paid less taxes than schoolteachers and firefighters.
This is because he lied when filing his taxes for years.

Alex,
Our district is facing a clear choice in this election. And thanks to the hard work of our supporters over the course of this incredible campaign, we’ve changed what’s possible in our district.
News networks like CNN and independent elections analysis groups like Inside Elections and the Cook Political Report are declaring this race a toss-up \-- and we need your help to keep up that momentum. Chip in $5 or whatever you can now:

We’re up against a candidate whose record proves he’s not in this fight for the families of our community -- and we must fight back.
Troy Nehls is a former police officer with a long record of misconduct, from being discharged for mishandling evidence to lying about being charged with a crime in a sworn statement. He’s attacked survivors of sex trafficking and downplayed and denied the existence of coronavirus even as his own employeers got sick -- and he’s proven eager to become a mouthpiece of Washington special interests and gut health care for millions of families across this state.
Sri Preston Kulkarni is a lifelong public servant and diplomat who knows firsthand what it’s like to nearly go broke from our broken health care system. He’s in this fight to stand for working families in our district and expand access to affordable care, not gut it.
That’s the clear choice we’ll be facing in this election.

957,"Alex,
Instead of focusing on the task at hand and leading our nation through this time of uncertainty, our President would rather stoke flames of xenophobia and needlessly pass the blame onto others.
By using pejoratives like ""Chinese Virus"" or ""Wuhan Virus,"" the President is both ignoring the medically accurate label for COVID-19 and unfairly associating it with Chinese Americans. As a result of this stigma, many Asian Americans across the country have reported an uptick in physical and verbal harassment.
That’s why I, along with Congresswoman Judy Chu and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, penned a letter to President Trump condemning the anti-Asian rhetoric emanating from his office and the subsequent discrimination and violence it has encouraged.
Rhetoric like the President and his cabinet officials are using have serious consequences for the safety and well-being of Asian-Americans across the country. The CDC specifically recommends against associating a disease with a region or ethnicity because of the danger it poses.
This xenophobic language only serves as a distraction to the mission at hand \-- to practice social distancing, relieve our health care system, and flatten the curve so we can save lives and begin to return back to normal.
Folks around the country have enough hardships to grapple with during this pandemic -- from health concerns to food insecurity to loss of income and so much more. It’s cruel to cause even more trauma in the Asian American community by continuing to promote this ugly, misleading, and dangerous stigma.
I will continue fighting alongside my fellow advocates in Congress to denounce hatred and bigotry, reduce hate crimes and ensure they are being properly investigated, and protect the most vulnerable in our community.
Thank you,
Congressman Al Green

RONNY JACKSON RELEASES NEW AD - ""BATTLEFIELDS""
Amarillo, TX – Today, Dr. Ronny Jackson, President Trump's former White House Physician, Senior Advisor and Retired Navy Rear Admiral, released a new campaign ad titled ""Battlefields"". In the ad, Jackson details how DC Democrats and the liberal media sabotaged his character and service to his country during Ronny's VA nomination in order to try and tear down President Trump. In Congress, Ronny Jackson will be one of President Trump's staunchest allies, and will be the only freshman Congressman who, on day one, can walk into the Oval Office unannounced and produce immediate results for the people of the 13th district.
Said Jackson: ""During my entire 25 years of Active Duty service to my country, not a single person has ever questioned my character, commitment or integrity. It wasn't until President Trump appointed me as a senior member of his team that things began to change. The Democrats and the liberal media are consumed with so much hatred towards our President that they will say and do ANYTHING in an effort to tear him down - even if that means using lies and false accusations in an attempt to ruin someone's life and reputation in the process. We saw them do the same thing with Justice Kavanaugh. I like to say, I was Kavanaughed before Kavanaugh - I was the pregame. Since when did it become a crime to support OUR President? I will never apologize for supporting President Trump. I am honored to have served alongside him and honored to be his endorsed candidate in this race. He has given me his complete and total endorsement and he has asked the voters in this district to vote for me because he needs me in Congress to help him with his Keep America Great and America First Agenda.""

Transcript:
The liberal Left used lies against Ronny Jackson to attack President Trump. Now, Anti-Trump lobbyist and Democrat donor Josh Winegarner is using those same liberal lies to help his friends in the Swamp.
Texas voters know better. Dr. Ronny Jackson fought for our country on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. He stood with President Trump AGAINST the Swamp. And now, he will fight for you - in Washington.

Hi Alex! This week, Ronny made the liberal media's heads EXPLODE by, of all things, defending President Trump! Since when did it become such a crime to support the President of the United States?

Gazette: Send Lauren Boebert, a young impassioned leader, to Congress
The Gazette Editorial Board
Oct 12, 2020
If Lauren Boebert lands a job in Congress Nov. 3, she will improve the brand of the Republican Party.
A 33-year-old wife, mother of four and owner of a highly unique business, Boebert drew media intrigue even before she shocked the political establishment by defeating five-term Republican Rep. Scott Tipton in the primary. In addition to movie star looks, she exudes passion for freedom, capitalism and the United States that makes the socialist, anti-America sentiment of AOC + three look gloomy and sad.
In the big league of Congress, she could lead a national, youthful, patriotic, pro-capitalist movement to rival the fashionable narrative that tells young Americans their country is evil.
While left-wing feminist leaders cast women as victims, Boebert looms large as a 100-pound symbol of female empowerment. Women can start with nothing and have big families, provide for them, and defend them.
She founded and owns the iconic Shooters Grill in Rifle. After a man was beaten to death outside the restaurant, Boebert wondered how she and other women would protect themselves from similar crimes. She decided to train with a handgun and wear it on her hip. Soon, nearly all her female employees followed suit.
In a meeting with The Gazette’s editorial board, Boebert exuded an unequivocal devotion to freedom, free markets, compassion for others, and the joy of discovering self-sufficiency.
“I learned in that moment that if I take a stand and speak for what I believe is right I can affect and represent millions,” Boebert said. “That moment” was Boebert arriving, after a three-hour drive, at a campaign rally by then-presidential candidate Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke in Aurora. O’Rourke, a Democrat, had promised to confiscate rifles if elected president.
“I was in the right place at the right time, so I grabbed the microphone with my Glock on my hip,” she recalls. “I looked him in the eyes and I told him ‘Hell no you are not.’ I didn’t see anyone standing for freedom, but I saw a whole lot of people willing to give our freedom away.”
The woman left speechless a powerful, rich, white-male darling-of-the-media. The confrontation went viral, and Boebert became a routine guest on cable news. President Donald Trump, who had supported Tipton, publicly and privately congratulated her after the primary and invited her to the White House.
Boebert’s belief in capitalism, freedom and the old-fashioned American way developed after a childhood of poverty, welfare, and all assortment of government assistance. Boebert moved with her family to Rifle as a teenager. There, she landed a job at McDonald’s and discovered the thrill of money that was earned.
“I’m so thankful for the owners who invested in me,” Boebert said. “I can still remember walking up the steps of our home and bringing mom home that first paycheck. I remember the pride and the empowerment that was connected to it and the sense of personal responsibility that began to develop.”
Later, as a young adult, she volunteered to visit with women at the Garfield County Jail. She told them upon release they could move past old mistakes and misdeeds and control their destinies by creating wealth for themselves.
Boebert abhors socialism, viewing it as an oppressor of the poor and otherwise disadvantaged. She bases her platform on a traditional interpretation of the Constitution and advocates policies designed to facilitate and assist with success for anyone who wants it. She defends the extraction of clean natural gas by a fracking industry under attack by left-wing activists in Denver and Boulder.
Boebert’s Democratic opponent, Diane Mitsch Bush, represents the antithesis of western, rural Colorado values. A retired sociology professor and far-left Democrat, Mitsch Bush has supported nearly every regulatory attack on oil, gas and coal producers who provide high-wage jobs and tax revenues throughout her district. Organizations hostile to the Second Amendment have endorsed Mitsch Bush in past campaigns.
Her endorsements are a who’s who of left-wing organizations, including Planned Parenthood, the AFL-CIO and an assortment of other unions including Unite Here! — a group with such extreme demands it threatens the survival of resorts and hotels throughout District 3 and the rest of Colorado.
Mitsch Bush would begin her congressional career one-month shy of turning 71. By no fault of her own, she would approach her 80s before acquiring the committee assignments and level of seniority Colorado needs to improve a relatively weak delegation in Congress.
Entering Congress at age 34, colleagues would view Boebert as a force of the near future to invest in today. She would likely get coveted committee assignments while standing out nationally as an energetic new symbol of what people can do in a country that stands for justice, prosperity, personal empowerment, and freedom for all above all.
Vote for Lauren Boebert and empower the kind of inspiring, high-quality candidate that seldom comes along.

Friend,
Eight minutes and 46 seconds: That’s how long a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on George Floyd’s neck. George gasped “I can’t breathe” and eventually became unresponsive. This cruel, cold-blooded murder has been witnessed by millions and has since sparked a groundswell of action as protesters across the country march for an end to racial injustice.
It isn’t enough to demand that the officers involved in George Floyd’s killing be held accountable for their crimes. We must work to dismantle the racist systems that led to George’s death, and the deaths of so many other Black Americans for generations. Institutional racism has also resulted in discrimination against Black Americans in countless forms, including in healthcare, in our workplaces, in our schools, and at the voting booth.
As your Representative, I pledge to do my part -- I’ll continue to learn, to fight for laws and policies that will make our communities safer and more just for all Americans, and to hold this Administration accountable. But here’s what I’m asking from you: Don’t remain silent. Speak out, or use your platform to elevate others. And if you have the means, please consider donating to organizations like the NAACP.
This is our chance to stand united and push for impactful, lasting change in our communities. So in George Floyd’s memory, I hope you’ll join me in fighting for a more hopeful, more just future.
Thank you,
Ted

Friend,
On Wednesday, 52 Republican United States Senators voted to acquit the President on both articles of impeachment brought forth by the House of Representatives. Disturbingly, many conceded the points argued by my colleagues -- that Donald Trump did pressure the Ukrainians to interfere in our elections -- but they concluded that even this most profound subversion of our Democracy wasn’t enough to warrant his removal.
These Senators had a job to do: They had a responsibility to hold Trump accountable for his crimes and to demonstrate that no one, not even the President of the United States, is above the law. They were too afraid to do their duty -- and we can’t ever let them forget it.
Whoever heard of a trial with no witnesses or documents? Will you add your name today to show that the American people strongly condemn the GOP’s fake impeachment trial and their decision to acquit the President?
Best,
Ted

Friend,
Around this time last month, I was still holding out hope that Republican members of Congress might find the strength and the moral courage to hold Trump accountable for his crimes.
And then Devin Nunes threatened to sue me for telling the truth about his role in Trump's Ukraine extortion scheme. So, that was short-lived.
Now, as January comes to an end, my colleagues across the aisle are blindly defending the indefensible \-- and they need to know there will be consequences for their complicity come November.
But why wait until then? In a little over a month, I’ll be on the ballot in the California primaries. We could send a strong message to Trump’s enablers in Congress (looking at you, Devin Nunes) by closing out this month with a $5,000 fundraising surge to help us win big at the polls.
So will you contribute $500, $250, $100, or whatever you can before midnight on Friday to show the GOP that we aren’t afraid -- not now, and not on Election Day -- to make our voices heard?
Best,
Ted

Friend,
It’s almost Superbowl Sunday, which means another year has come and gone without my Cleveland Browns making it to the postseason \-- yes, I’m jealous of all the Chiefs and 49ers fans out there.
But imagine this: One team plays by the book -- observing all of the rules, abiding by the referee’s calls -- while the other team gets away without playing by any rules at all. Would we question the outcome of that game, or just move on?
Well, look no further than Congress, where Republicans have decided that the rules simply don’t apply to them or to Donald Trump. My colleagues make a show of being completely biased, even though they all swore an oath of impartiality; they’ve refused to consider key evidence, despite their moral and legal imperative to do so; and they’ve made it clear that there’s no crime that Donald Trump could commit that would warrant his removal from office.
But we can’t move on. We need the GOP to know that all eyes are on them -- and that the people are ready to vote them out. So will you rush in a donation before midnight tonight to help us hit our end-of-month goal and turn their game into a blowout?
Best,
Ted

Juneteenth marks the end of slavery in the United States -- the day when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas in 1865 to announce that the Civil War was over and declare that the last enslaved people were finally free.
Juneteenth is a time for us to reflect on the legacy of systemic racism that still exists today and the horrible crime of slavery in our country.
The fight for justice and equality did not end on this historic day 155 years ago. As we mourn the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and countless other Black lives lost, we must do better. We must demand change.
We must demand change of a criminal justice system that disproportionately incarcerates and kills Black Americans. We must demand change of a healthcare system where Black mothers are three to four times more likely to die from issues during pregnancy than white mothers. We must demand change of an education system where our schools go underfunded and Black and brown students are left behind.
I’m inspired by the brave activists we’re seeing in Michigan and across the country today who are coming together to demand change. When we stand together, when we listen, when we fight for one another -- I am confident there is nothing we can’t accomplish.
Juneteenth should be a national holiday, a reminder of our history and the work we have left ahead of us to realize equality and justice for every American. I am proud to co-sponsor a resolution from my colleague, Congresswoman Jackson Lee, to recognize Juneteenth as a federal holiday.
I will never give up the fight for equality and justice. I hope you won’t either.

Fellow Conservative,
How safe would you feel if your right to self-defense was eroded? If you were thrown in jail for defending your family during a car-jacking or a home invasion.
While Democratic cities are crippling our first responders and allowing violent crime to soar, Democrats in our district have gone even further to make our most vulnerable even less safe.
That’s right, a Democrat running for Congress in the First District has proposed a TOTAL REPEAL of “Stand Your Ground” laws.
STAND UP FOR STAND YOUR GROUND
If you don’t know what these laws are, you’re lucky. These protections are the only thing protecting gun owners from possible imprisonment and legal liability for defending themselves and others.
Criminalizing self-defense and gutting personal protections flies in the face of the spirit of the Constitution and the rights of the American people.
I want to take this opportunity to swear to the people of Michigan that I will always protect your right to defend your family, yourselves, and your property.
Do you stand with me? Take this poll and let us know if you support “Stand Your Ground” protections.
Your servant,
Jack

970,"Fellow Conservative,
This year has shown Michiganders what our priorities are. Our family, our freedom, and our financial security have become more precious to us than ever. They have also been threatened like never before.
Before you vote this November, ask yourself who you trust on these four fundamental issues:
* Who do you trust with your job security and getting the economy back on track?
* Who do you trust to fight for the safety and security of your families?
* Who do you trust to uphold First Amendment rights to free speech and free expression for ALL Americans?
* Who do you trust to love this nation and fix it—rather than dismantle and destroy it?
In any other election, that would be a debate. Not any longer. That is what’s at stake.
We’ve seen the Democratic vision for America these past months. Violent crime running rampant, censorship and cancel culture, and economic devastation across the country. We cannot let that be our future. We cannot give the mob a mandate this November.
TAKE ACTION!
We will recover from this as a stronger nation, but we need Republican leadership to make that possible.
We want to make sure that boarded up small businesses in Michigan represent a solemn reminder of our resilience, and not a vision of our future.
As your Representatives, we know that Republicans win on the economy every time. We win on keeping your families safe, championing free speech, and putting your money where it belongs: back in your pocket.
CHOOSE AMERICAN PROSPERITY!
We believe that this American comeback will make us stronger than ever. We want to lead a Michigan where ALL people can enjoy the prosperity of American principles and the American Dream.
Help us win in November!
We’re Fighting For You,
Michigan Republican Congressional Delegation

Alex,
As a Pennsylvanian and former Congressman, I can attest that Jim Bognet is the right man at the right time for the good people of our state. My friend, Jim, is running for Pennsylvania’s 8th Congressional District so we can be represented by someone with our Northeast Pennsylvania values. Losing is not an option.
You need to know that Jim is TOUGH on crime, BACKS the blue, and stands AGAINST illegal immigration.
He is the person for the job willing to make tough decisions.
This seat is one of the most vulnerable liberal seats in the country, and a #1 PICKUP OPPORTUNITY for the GOP. So, conservatives only have this short window of opportunity to support Jim and flip this critical seat RED.
The lives of law abiding citizens and their border security are at risk.
Since May, angry mobs have destroyed businesses and cities across the country. They will continue to do so, and take out their anger against our officers, unless more leaders step up to the plate.
That’s Jim Bognet.
Donate to Jim’s campaign during this short window of opportunity for Republicans. Send a signal to the Democrats that Pennsylvanians won’t tolerate radical liberals in Congress anymore.

Dear friends,
People across our nation are hurting. After the brutal killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis (adding to the long list of other Black Americans who have been unjustly murdered), millions of Americans have united in protest. They are taking to the streets and demanding accountability and real change to our society and our laws. Over the past few weeks, I've marched in Middletown and Wilmington and met with community leaders throughout our state; but most importantly, I've spent time listening to the thousands of Delawareans who have spoken out about the changes they want to see.
That's why I signed on to the Justice in Policing Act, as an original co-sponsor. This historic bill, first introduced by Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, is an important start to creating the change so many are demanding.
The Justice in Policing Act would finally designate lynching a federal hate crime and make it easier for the federal government to prosecute police misconduct. The bill also mandates racial bias training and makes many more important reforms that are long overdue.
But we're going to need your help to get this legislation passed in the Senate. Sign our petition to demand Mitch McConnell hold a vote on comprehensive policing reform today →
ADD YOUR NAME
This is an urgent moment for our nation. What we do in the next five months will change the direction of our country for years to come. This legislation isn't perfect and one law alone cannot end systemic racism, but it sends an important signal that we intend to begin this necessary work right now.
For too long, our country has not valued the lives of Black Americans, and simply saying Black Lives Matter is not enough. We must implement policies that actually address the injustices Black Americans face every day, and this bill is an important step in that direction.
The stakes could not be higher. But, as my friend Joe Biden says of the American people, ""There's never been anything we've been unable to do, when we set our mind to do it and we do it together."" I agree, and I believe we can come together to make the changes we need.
Please, sign our petition now and demand Mitch McConnell hold a vote on this crucial reform package!
Thank you all,
Chris

978,"Alex, I’m reaching out to you today because the LEFT is heavily TARGETING Long Island.
Andrew Garbarino is running for Congress to protect Long Island from the growing socialist threat.
Chip in now to help Andrew reach his CRUCIAL July End Of Month Fundraising Goal >>
Garbarino for Congress
Alex, I’m reaching out to you today because the LEFT is heavily TARGETING Long Island. Democrats have already poured MILLIONS in this race to prop up my opponent, Jackie Gordon. The Democrats have one goal in mind: turn the remaining Republican districts in New York into socialist strongholds to eventually put more AOC type politicians into power and push socialism in every community.
But with your help, I’m not going to let that happen.
Long Island has always been my home.
I am proud of my family’s deep roots on Long Island that stretch from Bay Shore to Patchogue. My family has profoundly invested in our fantastic community for decades:
Andrew Garbarino
* My grandfather and great uncle owned local grocery stores.
* My uncle operates our local deli.
* My father runs a small law firm in Sayville, NY.
At a young age, my family instilled in me a profound respect for Long Island and a strong passion for giving back to our community. That same passion to serve my community is the fuel that drives my campaign to be the next Congressman of New York’s 2nd Congressional District!
Congressman Peter King and Andrew Garbarino
Aside from my desire to serve my community, I’m also a proven fighter. As the representative of the South Shore in Albany, I have FOUGHT EVERY DAY against the Democrats’ socialist policies of dangerous bail-reform laws, allowing MS-13 to roam our streets freely, and now the “Defund the Police” movement.
That’s why if I’m elected the next Congressman of Long Island, I will faithfully represent our community and always put the needs of its people FIRST!
I’ve always worked to protect our greatest resource, the Great South Bay, and like my friends, Congressman Steve Scalise & Pete King, I'll do my part to drain the swamp and fight for conservative values.
It’s truly a disgrace what the Democrats have done to the State of New York. New York City and Long Island’s success is due to the entrepreneurial spirit, hard work, and grit of the people of this state and, these are the very ideals Democrats wish to destroy and replace with socialism. All while politicians like Jackie Gordon will stay silent and watch as it happens.
Andrew Garbarino
That’s why I’m so disgusted when I see what’s happening in New York City; violent crime is increasing, the NYPD is being attacked in broad daylight, and the looting and arson is happening without consequence.
Meanwhile, Jackie Gordon refuses to speak up in support of law and order and condemn this violence, fearing she might lose the support of the socialists in her party. At the end of the day, Jackie Gordon doesn’t care about Long Island. She only cares, first and foremost, about getting elected and following Nancy Pelosi’s agenda. That’s why I’m writing to you today.
Alex, will you chip in $5, $25, or $50 to protect our home of Long Island from the growing Socialist threat and help me reach my End of Month goal?
I go to battle for the people of New York every day, and I will bring that same FIRE and TENACITY to this race and all of the radical Democrats in Congress. But I’m going to need your help to get there!
Support my fight for Long Island and help me defeat Jackie Gordon on November 3rd!

Garbarino for Congress
Alex,
I wanted to take a moment to talk to you about a growing threat to my home of Long Island. Long Island has always been a refuge for liberty and conservative ideals in an otherwise liberal New York, but our future is being threatened.
After years of radical policies enacted by Democrats at both the state and local level, our backyard of New York City has fallen into a state of CHAOS and VIOLENCE. Even worse, my liberal opponent, Jackie Gordon, remains silent amidst this destruction!
New York City has been the testing ground for the Left’s SOCIALIST PLAN! An agenda that is now spreading to the rest of the country. Riots are happening in almost EVERY MAJOR CITY around the country!
Bring Law & Order Back to Our Cities
While Jackie Gordon likes to pretend she’s a moderate, her record would say different. She holds most of the same policies as AOC, and she was even endorsed by a far-left member of the Squad, AYANNA PRESSLEY!
Law & Order
If that’s not bad enough, she would be a rubber stamp for Nancy Pelosi and AOC’s plan to DEFUND OUR POLICE at a time when violent crime has RISEN EXPONENTIALLY in NYC. According to the NYPD, during July 2020 in New York alone...
There was a +177% increase in the number of shootings.
The number of murders increased by +59%.
A +286% increase in robberies from this time last year.
The number of auto thefts increased by +53%.
Bring Law & Order Back to Our Cities
Why does Jackie Gordon refuse to condemn this violence?
Perhaps it’s because she is afraid to condemn the radicals in her own party or worse, she actually sides with the LEFTIST MOBS and CRIMINALS, over the law-abiding citizens of New York and the NYPD.
Law & Order
Democrats, like Jackie Gordon, want to recreate this socialist nightmare on a national level in every city, town, and community around this country!
Alex, Long Island is only a couple of miles away from New York City, that’s why I’m reaching out to you! We can’t let this radical socialism spread to Long Island. Unlike Jackie Gordon, I want to protect Long Island and ensure it remains a place of LAW and ORDER, not mob violence! But I’m going to need your help!
Will you consider chipping in $5, $10, or even $25 to defeat Jackie Gordon and BRING LAW & ORDER BACK to our cities?
Chip in $5 to Bring Law & Order Back to Our Cities!
Chip in $10 to Bring Law & Order Back to Our Cities!
Chip in $25 to Bring Law & Order Back to Our Cities!
Chip in $50 to Bring Law & Order Back to Our Cities!
Chip in $100 to Bring Law & Order Back to Our Cities!
If my radical opponent gets elected, the Democrats will double down on this unrest and violence! Don’t let Long Island fall to socialism the same way New York City has!
Take A Stand Now and Help Me Bring Back Law and Order to our Cities! >>

980,"That hasn't stopped President Trump from flagrantly disregarding the Hatch Act.
Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend, we already knew that Donald Trump feels that he’s above the law. He’s demonstrated it time and again.
Last week, he continued the pattern during the Republican National Convention, turning the White House into a cheap prop for his re-election campaign.
Picture of the White House lawn during the RNC with Trump reelection propaganda.
It wasn’t just the President. He’s packed his administration with others who believe they’re above the law:
* Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a convention speech from Jerusalem, where he was traveling on the taxpayer’s dime.
* First Lady Melania Trump addressed the Republican National Convention from the Rose Garden.
* Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf staged an official naturalization ceremony as part of the televised convention.
There’s a reason why neither party has ever used the White House as the backdrop for their convention: it’s against the law.
A 1939 law called the Hatch Act made it a crime for government employees to do political work at taxpayer expense, and it bars the President from ordering federal workers to engage in political activity like, for example, throwing a political convention on the White House lawn.
It’s disgraceful, friend. With Senate Republicans enabling his lawless behavior, it’s clear the President believes he is above the law.
We need to send a message that laws and ethics still matter. To do that, we need to run this lawless President and his enablers out of town and flip the Senate blue. That starts with re-electing Mark Warner. Can you pitch in to Mark’s campaign and help us send a strong message on Election Day?

We’re getting a preview of what America would look like under the Left’s vision for 2020 and beyond – and it’s full of high crime, defunded police departments, hurting communities, and Democrats that don’t know how to lead!
Greg and the rest of us here on Team Pence are putting it all on the line right now so that we don’t have to see their radical agenda on full display, but with less than 100 days to go until Election Day we need you in this fight.
Can we count on you?
CHIP IN TO STOP THE RADICAL LEFT’S AGENDA
Thank you,
Team Pence

Alex,
There’s something going on in big cities across the country that liberals don’t want to talk about – but I’m not afraid to state the facts.
Crime rates are skyrocketing as Democrat-run cities turn their backs on law enforcement, and communities are paying the price for their terrible leadership!
Democrats have abandoned criminal justice in their crusade for social justice, and this is just a preview of what will happen if they take over America on November 3rd.
Friend, we MUST stop the Democrats before it’s too late. With just 97 days to go until we cast our votes, will you chip in to my campaign today to defend the future of law & order in America?
CHIP IN $10 TO DEFEND LAW & ORDER
CHIP IN $25 TO DEFEND LAW & ORDER
CHIP IN $50 TO DEFEND LAW & ORDER
CHIP IN $100 TO DEFEND LAW & ORDER
Like Ronald Reagan said, ""Freedom is never more than a generation from extinction."" But right now, those freedoms could be less than 100 days away from being permanently lost.
We can’t afford to lose our freedoms, and I’ll do whatever it takes to defend them in Washington just like I did when I was in the Marine Corps.
It’s absolutely critical that we start fighting today – and with our campaign’s fundraising deadline coming up on July 31st, we need all the support we can get right now. Will you join me today before it’s too late?
Chip in $10, $25, $50, or whatever you can spare to help our campaign stand up to the Left’s dangerous, radical agenda and keep our freedoms alive this November >>>
Thank you,
Greg Pence
Federal election law requires political committees to use best efforts to report the name, mailing address, occupation, and name of employer of individuals whose contributions exceed $200 during an election cycle. An individual may not contribute more than a total of $2,800 (maximum for Primary Election) per election to the committee. Federal law prohibits contributions to the committee from the general treasury funds of a corporation, labor organizations or national banks (including corporate or other business entity credit cards), from any person contributing another’s funds, from a Federal government contractor, or from a foreign national who lacks permanent resident status.

# Choose You This Day
July 1, 2020
Dear Alex,
Choose you this day. Those words are familiar. It is likely that you have already finished the phrase in your mind.
In his final address, to the nation of Israel, Joshua stood before the nation that he had led into the Promised Land. He reminded them of God's providential care. He reminded them of God's abundant blessings.
Joshua also warned them of the danger that lurked and would attack the foundation of their freedom. Then Joshua challenged the people to make a willful, conscious, decision to choose.
Joshua concluded with his decision. ""As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."" (Joshua 24:15)
Today, America stands at the point of decision. We are in a time like never before.
The primary issues today are no longer about the size of government, tax policy, or regulation. Today we see mob violence, destruction, and an intentional, planned, assault on America.
What began as calls for the removal of memorial statues, has now taken on the face of mob destruction and violence. Today statues of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt are not only criticized but defaced and damaged.
Princeton University removed Woodrow Wilson's name from its Public Policy Center. The Democrat Party in Orange County, California called for the renaming of the John Wayne airport because of comments he made in an interview with Playboy magazine half a century ago.
This mob frenzy has surpassed mere political correctness. It has now metastasized into a cancer that is out to destroy America itself.
Democrats blame President Trump for the violence while at the same time they call for abolishing the police. Seattle handed over several blocks of the city to a lawless mob who apparently could not settle on the name of their newly formed republic, ""Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone"" (CHAZ) or ""Capitol Hill Organized Protest"" (CHOP).
In the first month of CHAZ/CHOP, there were at least six shootings. After three shootings in a 48 hour time frame, one being fatal, the Mayor of Seattle boldly proclaimed that the city ""will not allow for gun violence to continue in the evenings around Capitol Hill.""
The Mayor's proclamation was so effective that 72 hours later there was another shooting. A week later yet another shooting left a 16 year old dead and a 14 year old in critical condition.
Meanwhile, Democrats, including Sanford Bishop, are characteristically silent about the lawlessness, crime, destruction, and decay. The problem is that Democrats have controlled these areas for decades. What happened in a matter of weeks in CHAZ/CHOP was just Democrat leadership on steroids.
Today, America stands at a critical crossroads. The violence and destruction that we see around our nation share no DNA with the values of the people of the 2nd District.
I am speaking up and standing up for your values. I am speaking up and standing up for you as I challenge Sanford Bishop.
I need you to stand with me. I need you to put skin in the game with me.
I am regularly asked if the Republican party will support our race. Yes they will, but they need to see that the people of the 2nd District are standing up. Now is the time to take a stand.
When you donate to Don Cole for Congress, the money stays with my campaign and is focused right here on my campaign. Your contribution will go to promote your values and you can count on that.
You may have never donated to a political campaign before. Now is the time, today is the day.
We are at a time as never before. Right now, you, not anyone else, but you stand at a point of decision.
Some of my readers have already given generously and sacrificially. If you have not given to my campaign yet, then I ask you to do it now.
The number of individual donors is just as important as how much the donors give. Will you put some skin in the game by donating as little as $2.20 (2nd District in 20) or $20.20 (Send DC to DC in 2020)?

# Anticipated Consequences
July 10, 2020
Dear Alex,
Between May 31 and June 27, a mere four weeks, 93 people were shot in Atlanta. That is more than double the number from the same period in 2019.
Not only has the number of shootings doubled, the cost of human lives in the destruction has more doubled. In the same period last year there were six fatal shootings. In the past four weeks, 14 of those shootings ended in death.
The victims included a 10 year old who fortunately survived, an 18 year old, killed while selling bottled water, and an 80 year old man, apparently the unintended victim, killed at his home in a drive-by shooting.
The tragedies heightened on July 4th, when most families were celebrating Independence Day. A precious 8-year old, African American girl was killed by a group of armed men. They stopped the car she was riding in and then opened fire on the car.
That same day a fight broke out at an outdoor party to watch fireworks in Northeast Atlanta. The fight escalated to the shooting of 14 people.
While the gun fight was taking place in Northeast Atlanta, another group opened a battlefront further South. Between 60 and 100 protesters were at the Georgia State Patrol headquarters South of the Capitol area.
Some in the group, armed with rocks and spray paint, targeted the Headquarters. They spray painted the buildings, smashed windows, and tossed what the Atlanta Journal referred to as fireworks through the broken windows.
Whatever they threw in the building started a fire. Two Department of Public Safety personnel were treated for smoke inhalation.
Russell Covey, a criminal law professor at Georgia State, made a misguided observation. He said that lack of police presence “may create something of a vacuum of authority.""
I disagree with Dr. Covey. There was no vacuum of authority. There was plenty of authority at work.
It was not the authority of the city of Atlanta and Georgia law. It was authority exercised by design with strategic, organized, intent by those who hate America and the freedom that we have.
Even the organizers of some of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests said that the ones who attacked the Headquarters were not with them. BLM organizer, Quinton Davis, told WSB TV that the individuals showed up suddenly and immediately got aggressive toward the police.
We need to understand what is taking place here. There are those who are hard at work to instigate anger, division, and hatred between groups.
Their intent and purpose is to undermine and tear down our freedom and liberty. Under the guise of speaking up for some cause, they plant the seeds of destruction in whatever field is fertile.
Our elected leaders play into their hands when they lead based on heightened emotions stoked with spun narrative. The knee-jerk reactions, such as abolishing law enforcement agencies lead to anything but peaceful conversation and positive change.
Headlines in the Atlanta newspaper blare stories of crime, violence, and ultimately death of innocent children. Police desperately want to serve and protect but they can no longer trust the ground rules of policy and the law.
Take a look at where this chaos, confusion, and calamity is taking place. These are all cities controlled by Democrats.
For decades, these cities have had the same problems. The leaders blame the same people. They are stuck on the same platform. They repeat the same promises. Meanwhile their communities steadily perish.
The destruction, chaos, and loss of innocent lives in these cities like Atlanta and Seattle should come as no surprise. The real people who live in these communities are fed up.
There are anticipated consequences. I anticipate a change.
Join me to make a change.
Sincerely,
Signature-Donald-E-Cole

One of the hardest things for me to watch has been the apathetic response to the decline of New York. This used to be one of the cleanest, safest, big cities in the world, but voters ""have become"", as the song goes, ""comfortably numb.""
LOVE for New York
Patriot,
What will it take for people to wake up: Voter fraud, riots, lockdowns, trash piling up, spikes in violent crime, sending COVID positive patients back to nursing homes, corruption, 2 years of the Russia hoax?
Take Back NY-13
New York City is ground zero for the leftist assault on America. I decided to run for Congress because I can’t stand watching the destruction of my beloved home.
One of the hardest things for me to watch has been the apathetic response to the decline of New York. This used to be one of the cleanest, safest, big cities in the world, but voters ""have become"", as the song goes, ""comfortably numb.""
Help Us Finish the Quarter Strong
But it’s not too late. We are ending the quarter and have 5 weeks until the election. Help us meet our financial goals. Radical representatives like my opponent Adriano Espaillat are counting on you to not show up, or support my campaign. Like other Democrats, Espaillat is on board for the woke agenda. He brags about being the first undocumented immigrant in Congress, if that tells you anything.
This is the epitome of leftwing hubris. The modern Democratic Party has contempt for you and the country. Shove it back in their smug faces and support my campaign.

He’d had a measure of notoriety for about 8 years, since he was the spokesman for project called PARK 51 which used a lot of opaque foreign money to gain that unwelcome foothold. While that construction was ultimately blocked, his group did manage to erect a so-called, “Islamic Cultural Center” on adjacent land.

The government’s first priority is the protection of its citizens, everything else is secondary. There is no doubt that this is the first and oldest reason for government. But in the year 2020, haughty progressives believe that we are beyond the need for the police.
LOVE for New York
Fellow Patriot,
There's 1 month until the biggest election of our time. But it seems like Democrats have forgotten the purpose of government.
The government's first priority is the protection of its citizens, everything else is secondary. There is no doubt that this is the first and oldest reason for government. But in the year 2020, haughty progressives believe that we've evolved beyond the need for the police.
I Support Our Police
According to the amNewYork,
> ""NYPD officers also made 607 gun arrests in September 2020 — the highest monthly total recorded since the department launched its CompStat crime tracking program in 1994. Year to date, 2,801 gun arrests have been made by the department — up 7% for the year.""
What happened? Radical politics, that’s what happened. Self-styled ""criminal justice reform activists"" are actually a bunch of Soros funded district attorneys, woke morons, and race baiters. Their game is societal equity, not equality and the results have been disastrous.
> Don't Handcuff The Police
>
What exaclty is the ""transformative change"" being called for by the radical Left?
How many streets need to burn in this social experiment?
Enough is enough.
The Big Apple was once one of the safest cities in the world, and with a return to real policing practices we can achieve that status again. I will fight for law and order. It's time for the adults to take control and Make New York First World Again.

Lovelynn Gwinn

Because common sense and rationality have flown out the window, the only solutions we hear from Democrats are extreme ones.
LOVE for New York
Fellow New Yorkers,
Abolish the Police. That's the new Leftist tagline.
Because common sense and rationality have flown out the window, the only solutions we hear from Democrats are extreme ones.
Mind you, these are the same individuals who think cops are the only people who should be allowed to carry guns. Quite the oxymoron.
The civilians (mobs) calling for this are useful sheep who think actual good will come of getting rid of the force tasked to deal with crime, but it's a far more sinister goal from the liberal elites, who are obviously using the chaos to their personal advantage.
Contribute just $25 to the Lovelynn Gwinn Campaign!
By honing their sights in on the police, the Democrats have therefore admitted that they've declared war on America.
We CANNOT let them win!
Donate to Lovelynn Gwinn's campaign for District 13 in NYC!
Despite being in the minority demographically, they have slowly taken over EVERY facet of American society. That is why:
* Public schools and universities are indoctrinating your children
* The news outlets are propaganda mills
* Your opinion is silenced on social media
* It's easier to buy recently-illegal drugs than to get a business license
* Criminals are martyred and heroes are vilified
American patriots have been complacent to the theft of our nation for far too long! It is time to take it back, city by city!
That is why you need to elect a TRUE conservative to office. Donate just $25 to my campaign!
Don't let the American Dream die out from the inside.
Sincerely,
Lovelynn Gwinn
Candidate for NY-13

Maybe it’s time to rethink this “police reform” thing. With a terrible record on crime, corruption, and a city that is getting dirtier by the hour, Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced that he has taken the “Obama Foundation pledge to reform policing in our city.” Well Hot damn New York!
LOVE for New York
Friend,
Maybe it’s time to rethink this “police reform” thing. With a terrible record on crime, corruption, and a city that is getting dirtier by the hour, Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced that he has taken the ""Obama Foundation pledge to reform policing in our city.""
$25 Put Up a Fight
According to De Blasio, the Obama Foundation pledge includes:
* Overhauling use-of-force policies
* Instituting de-escalation training
* More police accountability
Wait a minute. This looks like more restrictions on the police! This has been tried across the country, thanks to George Soros, and the effects have been devestating.
An article by James Varney for the Washington Times claims,
> “Soros-backed DAs in Philadelphia, St. Louis, San Francisco and other cities have fired scores of experienced prosecutors and, as promised, stopped prosecuting low-level quality-of-life crimes such as disorderly conduct, vagrancy and loitering.”
$50 Retake Liberal Districts
Varney continues,
> “The city has suffered a crime surge since the Soros-backed prosecutor took office. Violent crime rose by 8.8% since 2006. In terms of violent crimes per 100,000 residents, St. Louis has surpassed Detroit as America’s most violent city.”
Philadelphia too saw a spike in violent crime that reversed positive trends.
> “Homicides in Philadelphia, which fell below 300 annually for four consecutive years through 2016, have again shot up, rising by 34% in 2020 and hitting 257 as of Aug. 3, according to police department figures.”
What's happening in Philadelphia is happening in Democratic-run cities across America including in New York. We deserve better. New York is a world-class city with a world-class police department. It's time to unclip their wings and let them return to doing what they do best, policing!

New York City is ground zero for the leftist assault on America. I decided to run for Congress because I can’t stand watching the destruction of my beloved home.

But it’s not too late. We are 5 days away from the biggest election in our lifetime. Help us meet our financial goals. Radical representatives like my opponent Adriano Espaillat are counting on you to not show up, or support my campaign. Like other Democrats, Espaillat is on board for the woke agenda. He brags about being the first undocumented immigrant in Congress, if that tells you anything.
This is the epitome of leftwing hubris. The modern Democratic Party has contempt for you and the country. Shove it back in their smug faces and support my campaign.

“The first thing I say is look at the congressional races, and New York, you’ve got at least three, four, maybe even five competitive seats.

Democrats have long had a stranglehold on the Empire State, but their reckless policies may have gone too far.
The New York Post reported that President Trump, “believes a spike in violent crime and high taxes can help him win his home state in an upset against Biden and running mate Kamala Harris.”

I have watched our once vibrant community devolve to dangerous, empty streets. I miss the packed cafes, the hustle and bustle, and the unique creativity that can only be found in the Big Apple. We can return to former glories, but it will require political change.
Now is the time to make that change. For the first time in my life, Republicans have chance to take NYC and with it, the United States House of Representatives. I couldn't be more excited.
Before my campaign for NY CD-13, I was involved revitalization projections on the Upper West Side. You see, cleaning up New York is more than a career in politics— It's my life.
A better New York starts with responsible leadership. Donate today, and together we will make New York deserving of the title ""Empire State"".

998,"Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend —
I’m sure folks have seen the protests this weekend in response to George Floyd’s murder at the hands of police officers, and years of violence against the Black community. As of writing this email, three of the officers involved have not been charged. We need a full investigation and accountability for all involved in this crime.
Black Americans have been denied justice in our country for far too long. Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and too many others should still be alive today — and the painful truth is that if they were white, they probably would be.
For some this moment is a wake up call. For others, this is the America they have always known — simmering just below the surface. We all have a responsibility to challenge racist systems and demand not only justice, but accountability, and meaningful change — starting at home.
It’s easy to simply say hate has no place in America, but as your Senator it’s my duty to do more. Throughout my time in the Senate, I’ve supported measures to prevent discrimination against people of color at work, at school, and at the ballot box. You have my promise that I will continue to fight for legislative changes that make our Commonwealth — and our country — a more just place.
This is a moment to act. I hope you will join me in confronting biases, hate, and discriminatory systems in place in our communities, schools, and in our justice system.
It is not now, nor has it ever been enough, to simply say we believe in equality. We have to show up and do the work to fight against injustice and racism. For some, that means joining protests, or signing a petition. For others, that may mean making a donation amid this challenging time in our country. If you’re looking for ways to take action, consider supporting the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, or an organization in your community focused on securing justice.
And, I leave you with this: the fact remains that the vast majority of us want to live together, want to create a better life, and want justice for everyone in this country. We must join together to achieve that goal.
Thank you,
— Mark Warner

999,"That hasn't stopped President Trump from flagrantly disregarding the Hatch Act.
Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend, we already knew that Donald Trump feels that he’s above the law. He’s demonstrated it time and again.
Last week, he continued the pattern during the Republican National Convention, turning the White House into a cheap prop for his re-election campaign.
Picture of the White House lawn during the RNC with Trump reelection propaganda.
It wasn’t just the President. He’s packed his administration with others who believe they’re above the law:
* Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a convention speech from Jerusalem, where he was traveling on the taxpayer’s dime.
* First Lady Melania Trump addressed the Republican National Convention from the Rose Garden.
* Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf staged an official naturalization ceremony as part of the televised convention.
There’s a reason why neither party has ever used the White House as the backdrop for their convention: it’s against the law.
A 1939 law called the Hatch Act made it a crime for government employees to do political work at taxpayer expense, and it bars the President from ordering federal workers to engage in political activity like, for example, throwing a political convention on the White House lawn.
It’s disgraceful, friend. With Senate Republicans enabling his lawless behavior, it’s clear the President believes he is above the law.
We need to send a message that laws and ethics still matter. To do that, we need to run this lawless President and his enablers out of town and flip the Senate blue. That starts with re-electing Mark Warner. Can you pitch in to Mark’s campaign and help us send a strong message on Election Day?

1000,"Radical Democrats are putting our public safety at risk. Here’s how we can fight back.
Mowers for Congress
Exciting news, Alex –
Every time I turn on the news these days, it’s as though I’m flipping through a comic book - cities rife with crime, buildings destroyed, businesses looted, cops attacked, violent riots that turn deadly in our streets...
And it’s not just happening in big cities, it’s right in our own backyards.
America is beginning to look like Gotham City, and it’s time for us to put an end to the insurrection.
As Democrats in Washington turn their backs on law-abiding citizens and police officers in support of rioters and criminals, it’s more important than ever for us to elect a new generation of law and order conservatives like Matt Mowers.
Mowers will stand up to the Left’s efforts to defund the police and protect our Second Amendment rights. That’s why I’m proud to join President Trump, Rep. Elise Stefanik, and more than 350 other Republicans in endorsing Mowers for Congress.
Gov. Scott Walker Endorses Matt Mowers - Donate Now
Radical Democrats are putting our public safety at risk by allowing mobs of violent anarchists to desecrate our cities. They don’t think we deserve police protection against rioters who burn cars or throw bricks through our windows, but they refuse to leave their own homes without private security details. Their hypocrisy makes me sick.
It’s more important than ever for us to send strong conservatives like Matt Mowers to Washington to restore order and keep our families safe. I’m doing everything I can to support Mowers ahead of Election Day, and I hope you will too, Alex.
Help send a law and order conservative to Congress by chipping in $20 to Mowers' campaign today: [[URL REDACTED]]

There’s been lots of news this past week about Governor Bullock, our campaign and issues facing Montanans like you. Here are some of the top stories from this past week for you to check out below!
Bullock, Daines mix it up in first U.S. Senate debate - KRTV
Bullock, Montana’s current governor, fired back by saying that Daines is running against him, not House Speaker Pelosi – and that it’s Daines who is the pawn, for corporate interests and GOP leadership. “Sen. Daines has accomplished a lot for corporations,” Bullock said. “When you look at those (2017) tax cuts, 83 percent went to the top 1 percent; we get nothing. He’s been able to get a lot done for the wealthy and corporations, but not most Montanans.” Bullock, who resisted running against Daines until the week before the filing deadline in March, said he chose to run because Washington needs a senator who will work with both sides of the political aisle to solve the nation’s numerous problems. “The whole time I’ve been governor, we’ve actually had a majority Republican legislature,” he said. “But we’ve put the politics aside and we’ve gotten things done.
Governor directs $50M from COVID Relief Fund to support Montana child care - KTVH
The State of Montana will be directing $50 million in Coronavirus Relief Funds towards maintaining and expanding child care and support for Montana Families. “As more Montanans return to work and families prepare for the upcoming school year, we must ensure there are options to provide high quality and flexible care during this emergency,” Governor Steve Bullock, D-Montana, said. “In addition to filling gaps in care for families, this funding will also sustain providers as they work to maintain and expand childcare options to ensure that even in challenging times, our kids can still receive the care and education fundamental to our state’s future.” The goal of the funding is to increase child care options for Montana families, and in turn help families get back to work.
Bullock: Counties can opt for mail election - Billings Gazette
Gov. Steve Bullock said Thursday that he'll let the state's counties decide on holding the November general election by mail, while expanding early voting and preserving options to cast a ballot in person. ""It only makes sense that we start preparing now to make sure no Montanans will have to choose between their vote and their health,"" Bullock said in a press conference Thursday. ""They didn't have to in June and they shouldn't have to in November.""
Letters: Montana needs a strong leader like Bullock - Missoulian
The key issue in Montana’s Senate election this year is leadership. Montana needs leaders who understand the concepts and nuances of strong, well-reasoned leadership. Good leaders are accountable for their area of responsibility. Good leaders make decisions based on quality science-based evidence and the council of reasonable and thoughtful staff, not partisan platforms or fear-mongering rhetoric. I spent 37 years with the Gallatin County Sheriff’s Office, 11 years as sheriff. I worked alongside Attorney General/Governor Bullock and tackled some of the most difficult and challenging issues of my career. I know first-hand how Steve has consistently shown his concern and support for citizens, crime victims, and Montana’s dedicated peace officers.
Letters: Bullock is great leader - Helena IR
Many politicians seem much more interested in taking credit for accomplishments and blaming their opponents for missteps than they are actually solving problems, especially when we get this close to an election. But not Gov. Steve Bullock. Last week, Gov. Bullock announced two new partnerships that will allow Montana to ramp up coronavirus testing again, even as we still lack sufficient testing on a national scale. This is a perfect example of why Gov. Bullock has been such a great leader for our state. The dysfunction in Washington is as rampant as ever, but Gov. Bullock is not letting that stop our progress in Montana. From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Gov. Bullock has worked with people from both parties around the state and country to get Montana the supplies and resources it needs to slow the spread of the virus.
Letters: Bullock will bring fiscal leadership to US Senate - Helena IR
When I cast my vote for the U.S. Senate, I’m going with someone who has experience successfully balancing the books. As governor, Steve Bullock brought Democrats and Republicans together to create Montana’s first-ever “rainy day fund.” Not only did he balance the budget, but Bullock was able to set aside over $100 million for when our state would need it most. During this pandemic, we’ve been lucky enough to not have to face hard decisions like cutting school funding or other essential programs due to budget constraints, and that is all thanks to Gov. Bullock and his smart fiscal leadership.

NEW ADS
20 years ago, William Perry Pendley tried to block access to our rivers and streams.
20 years ago, Steve Bullock took him on in court & won.
Governor Bullock has always & will always fight to keep our public lands public.
As Americans, we believe that everyone’s voice matters. But these days, the people and corporations with the biggest bank accounts are the ones who get to be heard. That’s why the toxic influence of money in politics has to stop, and it’s why Governor Bullock has spent his career fighting to end it.
As Attorney General, Steve Bullock took the fight against Citizens United all the way to the Supreme Court. When the Supreme Court ruled against Montana, he kept up the fight. As Governor, he passed the DISCLOSE Act, one of the strongest campaign finance disclosure laws in the country. He required any company contracting with the state to disclose expenditures it makes to influence elections, and he banned the use of foreign money in our state’s elections.
In the Senate he’ll work to make Washington work for Montanans, not for millionaires and special interests.

Hi Alex,
I'm supporting Mike Pellicciotti because Washingtonians need an independent Treasurer who works for the people and shows up for the job. Join me and Mike on Zoom on Tuesday, October 6th!
As an Assistant Attorney General in my office, I know Mike well. He puts people first by prosecuting financial crimes. As a State Representative, Mike is leading the fight for increased government transparency, smart economic growth, and fiscal accountability.
Mike won the Primary Election -- but his Trump-supporting opponent just dropped over $140,000 into TV ads. In other words, he is going to try and buy this race. In contrast, Mike doesn't accept any corporate contributions. He relies on people like you to fuel his grassroots campaign.
With so much on the line this November, I hope you will join me in supporting Mike Pellicciotti on Tuesday, October 6th at 6:00PM on Zoom.

Every American should have access to high quality health care regardless of their income. Every year, American families see their premiums rise while their quality of care declines. Patients are dying because they are putting off medical visits they can’t afford. People are splitting prescription pills so they can make their outrageously high-priced, life-saving drugs last a little longer. We've had enough.

At the RNC, Trump said he's ""done more in three years for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years.""
Let’s check the facts, Alex:
\-- He called African nations “sh*thole countries”
\-- He’s told Black Congresswomen to “go back to the crime-infested places of which they came”
\-- And he won’t do ANYTHING to stop police brutality.

Hey --
Here in South Jersey, we know a thing or two about effectively implementing long-overdue policing reforms. When the Camden community came together to demand change, Donald -- then a State Senator -- joined their efforts to identify effective community-policing strategies, and use them to rebuild the Camden police force from the ground up.
And we saw some pretty incredible results, friend. We had an almost 50% reduction in crime, and our murder rate dropped by almost 70%. And -- more importantly -- the people of Camden felt safer. Officers became a part of the community instead of existing as an outside force, knocking on their neighbors' doors to get to know them and reading books to young children in local schools.
Watch this short interview with Donald today to learn more about these successful policing reform efforts in South Jersey:

The first step is to admit the problem. Then, it's critical we continue to bring people together and find the reform models that work. Donald says it best: we must push the envelope and continually reassess effectiveness to avoid sliding back into old, harmful patterns.
And -- most importantly -- we must continue to listen to the communities we serve.
We have a long road ahead of us -- but these kinds of community-centered policing reforms are a great place to start. And it's not just policy change on the local level that we need. Donald will continue fighting for federal solutions like the Justice in Policing Act to save Black lives, reinvest in educational and economic opportunities for underserved communities, and keep our communities safer.

Friends--
I am incredibly proud to stand with the LGBTQ community this Pride Month, and every month it takes to make sure no one is denied their freedom because of who they love or how they identify.
This is about equal rights, opportunities, and protections under the law. From marriage equality to life-saving hate crimes legislation, the work of pro-equality activists and lawmakers has helped us make some incredible progress since the Stonewall Riots of 1969.
But we still have a long way to go, friend. Will you join me today in committing to the fight for LGBTQ equality until we finally secure full, lived equality for all Americans?

It's important to acknowledge that the first Pride was a protest led by queer and trans people of color. And right now, our country is finally starting to reckon with the racism embedded in American life. Our vision of a more just, equal world must also include black and brown communities who face historic injustice that must be eradicated.
None of us are equal until all of us are equal. Can I count on you to join me in the fight for LGBTQ equality today, friend? Add your name now.

Alex --
It was not so long ago that financial companies refused to do business in Black-majority neighborhoods. These discriminatory redlining practices are now illegal -- but they are far from a distant memory.
In the midst of Philadelphia's civil unrest, a handful of opportunistic looters distracted from our message of racial justice by destroying and stealing property from drug stores, retail stores, and other local businesses we've come to rely on. Now, insurance companies are using ""crime scores"" to cut coverage and raise costs in ""high risk"" communities, which we all know means Philly's Black neighborhoods.
Crime scores are just redlining by another name. Join Dwight in speaking out against these new discriminatory policies. Add your name now >>
Abandoning small and minority-owned businesses in their time of need is just plain wrong. Our country is facing a painful but necessary reckoning with our racist history, and a renewed call for racial justice that has been denied for entirely too long. But insurance companies are using this as an opportunity to resurrect new discriminatory redlining practices -- and we must put a stop to it.
Dwight is now working across the aisle on the Helping Entrepreneurs Access Loans (HEAL) Act to funnel desperately needed funds to the businesses impacted by recent looting efforts. The property destroyed or damaged must be repaired and replaced to help small and minority-owned businesses get back up on their feet.
Our community's most vulnerable businesses need our help right now, Alex. If you support Dwight's HEAL Act and his work to end redlining and racial discrimination once and for all, sign the petition today.

Alex,
It's past time for policing reform in this country. For far too long, the federal government has subsidized and promoted an over-militarized approach to urban policing that is deadly for Black communities. The violence perpetrated by those sworn to protect is not new -- and it must be stopped.
In just a minute, we're going to ask you to support Dwight's proactive, community-centered policing strategy -- but first, we'll explain exactly what that means:
1. Expand the “Cop Next Door” program to incentivize officers to live in the communities they serve and build trusting relationships with their neighbors.
2. Create more police satellite offices so officers can be more visible and present in their communities with a safe place to meet with residents, complete paperwork, and even take meals.
3. Provide real-time data using new technologies to better prepare our officers for emerging threats with the information they need without establishing new surveillance.
4. Launching a Safe Place Initiative to make sure no one feels unsafe walking into a police station, fire station, community center, or library if they are in trouble.
5. Establish City Gun Courts to address illegal gun possession and get our streets safer, faster.
6. Work with federal prosecutors on programs like Project Safe Neighborhoods to get the most serious offenders off the street, and educate citizens about this swift punishment for more dangerous crimes like unlawful possession of a firearm.
7. Work with the police department and community groups to implement innovative gun programs to protect families from gun violence by and against juveniles.
Dwight has been advocating for effective, community-based solutions like these his entire life. So please Alex, add your name now to support the kind of policing reform programs that both reduce crime and promote cities’ quality of life and economic growth for all of its citizens.

Happy Pride, Alex!
Every year, we take some time each June to celebrate and lift up our LGBTQIA+ friends and neighbors. It's a time to reflect on how far we've come and recommit ourselves to the fight for full, lived equality that is far from over.
But it's important to remember that the first Pride wasn't a parade -- it was a protest. Led predominantly by queer and transgender people of color, the Stonewall Riots proved to be the catalyst that the LGBTQIA+ rights movement needed. And ever since those activists stood up and demanded better for their community in 1969, our country has seen incredible progress in non-discrimination protections, access to marriage and adoption services, hate crime legislation, and more.
But we've still got so much more work to do, Alex. It's not lost on me that this year's Pride month is kicking off amidst a historic uprising of fed-up Americans ready to fight for justice that has been denied for far too long. This month -- and every month -- I stand with Black Lives Matter, and I stand with the LGBTQIA+ community.
We must continue working together to make our shared vision of justice for all a lived reality. And I hope you'll join me in this critical fight. Add your name now to stand in solidarity with our Black, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, non-binary, queer, intersex, asexual, and two-spirit friends and neighbors.
I truly believe that, one day, we will live in a country where all of us will be able to live, work, and prosper freely -- no matter the color of our skin, who we love, or how we identify. We just have to keep putting in the work that transformative change requires.
In solidarity,

And that’s not all! Ralph Norman is one of the wealthiest members of Congress, yet he continues to line his campaign’s pockets with huge donations from pharmaceutical and insurance companies — all while voting against affordable healthcare for South Carolinians.
Moe doesn’t have a bank account in the millions, or big companies knocking down his door — but he has us, team. This grassroots team has already proved that we can bring folks together, take on leaders who aren’t accountable to those they serve, and bring honest leadership to our state.

Now, let’s prove we have what it takes to win!

Wow, what a month!
June was Pride Month — and Ralph Norman fought to allow employers to discriminate against LGBTQ+ Americans just for being who they are.
We’ve been reckoning with the epidemic of racism against Black Americans — and Ralph Norman initially voted against making lynching a federal hate crime.
We’ve been dealing with a spike in COVID-19 infections here in South Carolina — and Ralph Norman voted against COVID-19 relief for South Carolina families.
REPLACE RALPH »
I’ll be honest, team — I can’t find a reason not to show Ralph Norman the door.
But it’s not going to be easy, because all that energy Ralph hasn’t spent fighting for South Carolinians like you and me, he’s spent building his business in Congress and running hundreds of thousands of dollars of Facebook ads to hold on to his seat.
Can you rush a grassroots donation before tonight’s deadline to make sure we have what it takes to replace Ralph this year? We can’t do it without you!

1030,"Hello!
A while ago you showed interest in Mark Richardson and his bid to become your next Representative for District 3 of Ohio.
Currently it is held by Joyce Beatty, a Democrat who has held it for 3 terms, 12 years. During that time, Ohio has greatly increased in crime, poverty, addiction, loss of jobs, and so forth.
She ignores her constituents.
Mark is a decorated combat veteran of the US Navy. He was a helicopter pilot in a famous rescue mission of US hostages when the radical islamicists took over Persia, aka, Iran, and almost died when his helicopter went down during that mission.
He is fighting to protect your Constitutionally guaranteed, God-given rights.
Of all elections, each of which was more important, this one is critical. This election determines if you remain free with your freedoms intact and restored, with Mark's win, or if they are corroded and denied to you if the Democrat wins.
Mark is a genuine Republican, conservative, a Consitutionalist, an entrepreneur, and knows what it takes to run a business.
If you would like to help, please call the Volunteer Recruiter and Coordinator, Lori Sorensen, at 614-330-2150.
Thank you!
Sincerely,
Dean Sorensen

DEVELOPING: Democrats float clever plan to IMPEACH Trump and block his Supreme Court Nominee
[[EMAIL_REDACTED]]: Do you want Democrats to IMPEACH Trump and block his Supreme Court Nominee?
YES >>
NO >>
UNSURE >>
Remember: Donald Trump was impeached BEFORE Coronavirus. Now there’s OVERWHELMING evidence to convict him for his crimes.
[OFFICIAL IMPEACHMENT POLL] for [[EMAIL_REDACTED]]
Conducted on Sunday, 09.27.2020 for New York Democrats
This exclusive poll is registered to you. Please respond within [1] hour for your response to count in our data.
Trump just announced Amy Coney Barrett as his choice for Supreme Court Justice. The stakes could not be higher. The very fabric of our Democracy is at risk.
NOW: Trump is SHAKING at the idea of being impeached by House Democrats again. This would totally RUIN his evil Supreme Court plans!
Trump has committed so many impeachable crimes this year alone -- from intentionally covering up the COVID-19 outbreak to kidnapping peaceful protestors.
He deserves to be impeached so Amy Coney Barrett can be BLOCKED! This could change EVERYTHING!
But first, we need to know what Democrats in Virginia think about Trump’s impeachment and the Supreme Court. We need just [10] more responses!
Folks, if you care about saving the Supreme Court, you need to take this poll →
Should Trump be IMPEACHED to BLOCK his Supreme Court nomination?
YES >>
NO >>
