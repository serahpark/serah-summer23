0,Team Do(u)g,contact@dougjones.com,PSA: This email contains dog photos & puns,"Hey there, friend–
Doug’s very best friends – Scout and Dakota Jones – are taking their begging from the kitchen table and bringing their pleas to the people. They’ve been promised a trip to Washington, DC if their dad wins his election in November, and they’re asking you to do everything you can to make sure that happens.
In July, almost 60,000 of you pitched in to send Scout and Dakota to Washington (and yes, to re-elect Doug Jones) – and they are thrilled. So thrilled that they wanted to thank you by introducing you to some of their best friends working on the campaign here in Alabama – they heard you like that sort of thing.
Send us pictures of your furry friends to @DogJones4Senate on Twitter, too! Everybody at campaign HQ – two-legged and four-legged – would love to meet them!
And, if you can, pitch in for Scout and Dakota (Doug, too) – because Washington needs more loyalty, goodwill, and catching – not dropping – the ball.
Don’t let your furry friend get caught at the dog park not making a political statement for unity and progress! Get your Doug Jones for Senate bandana here >>
Thanks again from all of us here at Team Do(u)g!

Barack Obama: Elections matter. Voting matters.

Remember — 71% of Americans believe Roe v. Wade should not be overturned by the Supreme Court — and that number includes Republicans too.
That’s why it’s so atrocious that Rep. Pete Olson would go against SO many Americans to try to tear down Roe v. Wade. He joined 206 other members of Congress to petition the court to “reconsider” Roe.
But here’s the thing — our rights aren’t going to be torn down because we have a true champion running for Congress: Nyanza Moore.
Showing her support is the best thing we can do to tell Pete Olson that his actions are unacceptable. He’s not running for Congress again so we have a genuine opportunity for change.
Instead — we can uplift a legal mind who KNOWS the right thing to do and is standing on the RIGHT side of history when it comes to abortion rights.  Chip in $5 immediately >>

Hi there, Fellow Conservative,
From the moment President Trump was elected, Democrats have been clear about their intentions. They want to take back the White House, grow their Majority in the House, retake the Senate, and NOW reshape the Supreme Court for generations to come to push their liberal agenda.
Once the President took office, their agenda has become more radical than ever before. I’m shocked to see leaders on the left surrender to the liberal mobs’ demands to:
* Dismantle and defund the police
* Implement socialist policies like the Green New Deal that place a massive burden on the American taxpayer
* Appease violent looters and rioters who are holding cities across America hostage
* Erase American history by removing monuments to our Founding Fathers – sometimes with brute force
* And BLOCK the President and the Senate from our Constitutional duties to fill the Supreme Court vacancy
The radical left is closer than ever before to achieving their goal of total control. It’s up to grassroots fighters like YOU to help us gather the resources and strength to stop them!
Emergency 6X-MATCHING is unlocked for all gifts to defeat the radical left!

Thank you for supporting Brady PAC today! We’re working to pass meaningful, life-saving legislation to END the scourge of gun violence across America.
We have a comprehensive plan to elect gun reform champions and end the bloodshed. But no one is going to change our laws for us. If we sit idly by, the corporate gun lobby will keep its fatal grip on power, and we’ll continue to lose lives to senseless violence. So we’re turning to you for your help to save lives before it’s too late. Will you do your part and donate?
DONATE NOW TO PASS REAL GUN SAFETY REFORM →
The NRA couldn’t care less about the lives we lose every day to gun violence. They’ll do whatever it takes to keep themselves in power -- no matter the human cost.
We know we send you a lot of emails. But we can’t fight back against the NRA without help from thousands of grassroots activists. We don’t take checks from shady lobbiyists -- instead, we rely on a grassroots army of gun safety activists from across the nation to fund our campaign. We simply can’t do our work without you.

Hi there,
These numbers are REALLY exciting >>
We only need to flip 4 seats to take back the Senate in November! That's it! A flipped Senate means protecting pro-choice ideals on the Supreme Court, taking back the gavel from Mitch McConnell, and getting dozens of bills on the Senate floor that have stalled out under Republican leadership — and that's just the beginning. Donate $3 now to help flip the Senate!
Our Senate Women >>
Flipping the Senate is a huge priority for EMILY's List in 2020. And of course, we don't want just anyone to flip the Senate — we want pro-choice Democratic women to do it! We've already endorsed 5 women for the Senate: 2 pro-choice champions we MUST re-elect, and 3 women running to flip seats from Republican control (with more endorsements on the way).
Incumbents: Jeanne Shaheen (NH) and Tina Smith (MN)
RED-to-BLUE Flips: Barbara Bollier (KS), Sara Gideon (ME), and Theresa Greenfield (IA)
Donate $3 today to help elect all 5 of our endorsed Senate candidates.
Now for the bad news...
As you know, Republican senators remain committed to pushing an extreme anti-choice agenda that hurts women. All told, 39 Republican senators signed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court last week recommending that Roe v. Wade be overturned. We had already put 3 of them ON NOTICE for their past votes against women and families!
Donate $3 to help replace Sens. John Cornyn (TX), Thom Tillis (NC), and Joni Ernst (IA) with pro-choice Democratic women.
With the first primaries coming right up, it's all eyes on the Senate!
