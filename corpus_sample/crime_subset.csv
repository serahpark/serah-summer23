Alex,
Over the past week I've been asked several questions from both Republicans and Democrats regarding where I stand on the issues.
Donald Trump and Joe Biden's records of policy failures, racism, and inappropriate behavior are making many traditional voters reconsider who they will cast their ballot for.
Allow me to briefly tell you what I am fighting for:
* Healthcare Freedom: We can reduce the cost of health care 75% by allowing real price competition, and by substantially reducing government and insurance company paperwork. This will make health care affordable for most Americans, while also reducing the cost of legacy programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA.
* Criminal Justice Reform: As President, I will use my Constitutional authority to end federal civil asset forfeiture prior to conviction, and pardon persons convicted of non-violent victimless crimes. I will also work with Congress to end the failed War on Drugs and other victimless crimes.
* Auditing the Federal Reserve: Our reckless monetary system threatens to destroy the value of the U.S. entirely and must be stopped. As President, I will audit the Federal Reserve and begin shutting down the money printing machine.
* Peace: I believe we should turn America into one giant Switzerland -- Armed and Neutral. It's time to bring our troops home and engage in free trade with our neighbors across the globe.
* Spending & Debt: As President, I will draw a line in the sand. NO MORE DEBT. I will use my authority to block any new borrowing and veto all new spending increases.
Alex, I believe 2020 has become a pivotal year for our movement.
The demand for criminal justice reform has never been greater... the two-party system has utterly failed to produce candidates worth voting for... and Americans are desperate for a leader with real solutions.
I hope you will consider joining our campaign. Please consider making an online contribution of $20.20, $35, $50, $100 or whatever you can afford by clicking here.
Thank you,
Dr. Jo Jorgensen

Alex,
Do you know why I decided to run for President of the United States?
I am not seeking to wield some kind of almighty power, rule people's lives, or simply beat Team Red or Team Blue...
Voters need a real choice.
In 2016, the American people were forced to choose between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Millions were frustrated and chose to vote who they viewed as the lesser of two evils.
Now?
Well, the two-party system has yet again chosen to nominate two disastrous candidates for the most powerful position in the world.
My desire is to provide the American people with a viable third choice this election. I am not offering bailouts to big banks, massive contracts to members of the military industrial complex, favors to lobbyists, or selling access...
What is my offer?
Liberty.
I wish to be elected President of the United States and do the following:
* Order our troops home the moment I enter the Oval office.
* Pardon all non-violent and victimless crimes.
* Unleash the free market and allow capitalism to revive our economy and reduce the cost of healthcare.
* Authorize a FULL audit of the Federal Reserve and put an end to the money printing machine.
* Demand Congress send me legislation to enact TRUE criminal justice reform.
* Begin rolling back the unconstitutional spying apparatus the NSA, Homeland Security, and CIA have built to creep on everyday Americans.
Alex, today is the very last day of my August online fundraising goal. I have roughly $120,000 left to raise today.
I am really counting on your help, Alex.
There's no way I can do this without your help.
You and I have a powerful opportunity to spread the message of liberty in 2020, defeat the two-party system, and change the direction of our country.
You can click here to donate ANY amount. A gift of $20.20, $50, $100, $250, $500, or even more makes a big difference.
Once you complete your donation, reply back, ""Done!"" and I will do my best to thank you throughout the day (I receive over 1,000 messages a day so please forgive me if it takes a little time!).
Thank you so much, Alex.
Please act ASAP.

Alex --
We are often asked on the campaign trail, ""Does Jo see our memes?"".
The answer?
Yes, she does. And she loves them.
Here are three of her favorite memes she's seen since the campaign got started!
(Keep scrolling for an important message)
Duoploy Meme
Jo Star Wars
(Don't worry... Jo's trigger discipline is better than this)
Toy Story Meme
It's no secret Jo's supporters are the most enthusiastic of all the candidates running for President.
No one in the Democratic Party is exactly thrilled about Joe Biden and his disgusting lifelong record of being a drug warrior and advocate for tough-on-crime legislation.
And President Trump has millions of Republicans who identify themselves as ""Never Trump Republicans"".
Alex, we have the support and momentum behind us to make history on November 3rd.
Let's reach more voters with our message of free markets, reduced healthcare costs, bringing the troops home, and ending the failed war on drugs.

Jo Jorgensen 2020
Alex,
She wasn't on the stage but she was still a big winner from the first presidential debate.
Americans hated what they saw from Trump and Biden, and millions of them pulled out their phone to google Jorgensen. We had a huge spike on Google.
The traffic was overwhelming, We're hustling to keep up and prepare for the next onslaught, which we expect to happen during the next debate. You can help pay for this work by making a contribution.
Meanwhile...
You can watch what Jo was saying during her debate interview with Elizabeth Nolan Brown, or read direct answers to the specific questions asked during the Trump-Biden debate...
Dr. Jo Jorgensen answers the debate questions
Q: What are your views on Supreme Court appointments?
A: I would only appoint people who will actually obey the Constitution, including especially the rigorous limitations placed on government power by the 9th and 10th Amendments.
Q: What are your healthcare plans?
A: I would work to restore free-market healthcare. We need price visibility and competition to lower costs.
Q: What would you do about COVID-19, shutdowns, and masks?
A: I would let businesses decide whether to be open and when, where, and how masks must be worn. Customers could then make their own choices about where to go or not go based on those individual policies.
Q: What would you do about a vaccine?
A: I won't pretend to be America's pharmacologist in chief. Vaccine providers must do their job, and then individual Americans should be free to decide whether or not to take the resulting vaccines.
Q: What would you do about the economy?
A: The private sector uses resources better than the government. So I would cut government spending dramatically and put those resources back into the productive economy.
Q: What would you do about taxes?
A: I will cut taxes as fast as I can. Individual Americans will make better use of the money.
Q: What would you do about race relations in America?
A: Great Society programs destroyed black families. Then the Nixon administration launched the drug war to further devastate the black community. Then Senator Biden passed a crime bill that placed huge numbers of black men behind bars. I would end the drug war and all the other laws that police use to harass black people.
Q: How would you change policing in America?
A: I would repeal all victimless crime laws, so police would have fewer reasons to hassle people. I would also outlaw qualified immunity so that police can be held responsible for the consequences of their actions. The result would be fewer dead citizens and fewer dead cops.
Q: What would you do about the protests?
A: The Democrats and Republicans both use laws to impose things on people against their will. This makes people angry. I would work to repeal all such laws, thereby reducing the anger.
Q: Why should voters prefer you?
A: I won't use the government to impose things on them against their will. I'll free them to make their own choices provided they respect the equal right of others to do the same.
Q: What would you do about forest fires?
A: I notice that most wildfires start on public lands. I would try to put more lands in private hands and instruct the Forest Service to emulate what the private sector does to prevent fires.
Q: What would you do about global warming?
A: Increased use of nuclear power would do more to reduce carbon emissions than any other policy. I would end subsidies that favor other forms of energy, and remove obstacles that block the wider adoption of nuclear power.
Q: What do you think about election integrity?
A: Election integrity starts by letting all the ballot-qualified candidates appear in the debates.

Jo20-Logo
Alex,
This week, Americans will have the opportunity to watch Debate Train-wreck 2.0 with Mike Pence and Kamala Harris in the Vice Presidential Debate.
Mike Pence will serve as a shill for the Trump administration.
He will say anything to defend Trump's terrible record on spending and increasing the debt by TRILLIONS of dollars all while pretending to be a so-called, ""conservative"".
Kamala Harris will regurgitate everything she learned in debate prep to avoid discussing her horrendous record on criminal justice reform.
Biden and Harris are both responsible for locking up THOUSANDS of men and women for victimless crimes and have never apologized or done anything to rectify their mistakes.
In fact, Kamala Harris laughed about smoking pot on a podcast while failing to do anything to help the people hurt by the War on Drugs.
Make No Mistake: This is a fake debate and neither Mike Pence nor Kamala Harris will answer for their terrible mistakes.
Alex, Jo and I are fighting for REAL criminal justice reform and to pardon those Pence and Harris have locked up for victimless crimes...
We're fighting to cut spending and save our country from financial ruin...
We're fighting to unleash the free market to save our failing healthcare system...
And we're fighting to bring the troops home...
But we need your help.
The next FEC deadline is actually October 14th. Many of our contributions arrive near the end of the month... that won't work this time.

circle-cropped \(4\)
Here are my post debate thoughts on Trump and Biden:
Alex -- Watching President Trump and Joe Biden ""debate"" each other is mind numbing... but I do want to share my thoughts on what was discussed this evening.
Before I share my thoughts - During the last debate our campaign raised over $100,000 in 24 hours and EXPLODED with new supporters. Can we do it again? Please click here to donate $20.20, $50, $100, $250 or any amount.
The economy, lockdowns, and COVID19:
Biden is doing everything he can to place the blame on President Trump. In turn, Trump is attempting to blame Biden and the Democrats for destroying the economy by forcing businesses to shut down.
The reality?
These lockdowns have been a bipartisan disaster.
We have lost THOUSANDS of businesses and MILLIONS for jobs because of the actions taken by politicians willing to tear up the Constitution during a crisis.
As President, I would re-open our economy and unleash the free market to create solutions for viruses such as COVID19.
Foreign governments and backroom deals:
I can't pretend to know all the details of the back room deals President Trump and Joe Biden make.
However, I do know these men have a history of making shady deals and are well connected with the global elite.
I don't trust either of them with our economy, taxpayer money, or to act ethically in the White House.
Healthcare:
We will NEVER achieve victory on healthcare reform until we adopt free market solutions. We can dramatically reduce the cost of healthcare by reducing regulations, FULLY repealing Obamacare, and embracing innovation.
Criminal Justice Reform:
Neither of these men are qualified to speak about criminal justice reform. Biden enacted the 1994 crime bill and Trump has DONE nothing to end the War on Drugs.
As President, I would pardon non-violent drug offenders, seek to end qualified immunity, and stop arming police departments with weapons from the Pentagon.
Climate Change:
I am the only candidate proposing a solution that will cut our CO2 gas emissions rapidly... nuclear power.
We need to unleash the free market to solve environmental issues. Not the government!
Post Debate Call-To-Action:
During the last debate, our website traffic blew up, Google searches for our campaign reached record highs, voter pledges flooded in, and new donors. We even raised over $100,000 in 24 hours.
Americans are searching for another candidate to vote for. We MUST reach them during this critical window of opportunity and earn their vote.

After the February lynching of Ahmaud Arbery and the belated arrest of his killers last week, Georgia must pass hate crime legislation to honor the memory of Ahmaud and to ensure that justice is served in any future hate crimes.
That is why I am asking you to join me by demanding in the strongest possible terms that the Georgia Legislature pass its existing hate crime legislation H.B. 426 for Governor Brian Kemp to sign into law.
Friend,
Ahmaud Arbery’s murder is part of a system of oppression that extends beyond Georgia. The public outrage it has triggered it is not confined to our state lines.
The injustice made known to the public last week has stoked a national outrage and a call to action — as one of only four states without a hate crime law in place, Georgia must pass such legislation into law immediately as a justice tribute to Ahmaud Arbery and any future victims of such atrocities.
Please join me in calling for the Georgia Legislature to pass hate crime legislation with H.B. 426 for Governor Brian Kemp to sign into law. Once you have added your name, you will have the opportunity to contribute to the Georgia NAACP which is fighting for justice on behalf of Ahmaud Arbery’s family.
The culture of vigilantism that contributed to Ahmaud Arbery’s murder — a culture made legal by so-called “stand your ground” laws and encouraged by too many conservative politicians and personalities, as well as gun lobbyists and manufacturers — must end.
Add your name to join me in calling for the Georgia Legislature to pass the hate crime bill H.B. 426. We can change the law if enough of us speak up together.
Thank you for joining me.
Yours truly,
Teresa

7,"Friend,
David Perdue has used his position of public trust to enrich himself from the very first days after he was elected to the Senate, according to a new report published yesterday by The Intercept.
In 2014, he secured stock options from the financial technology company Cardlytics where he served as a board member, options that “would grow to be worth more than $6 million” as Perdue “has worked to roll back regulations that govern firms like [[URL REDACTED]] has sponsored legislation that would be to the firm’s benefit.”
Already this year, Perdue’s stock trades following a secret Senate briefing on coronavirus have raised ethical red flags, with possible evidence of insider trading. Now we are learning the details of how he has legislatively engineered the conditions under which his own investment is able to grow. It bewilders me that such an action is not itself a crime — but it is without question unethical.
Here is the bottom line: David Perdue is not fit to serve. His self-interest and self-regard as Donald Trump’s man in the Senate have led us to a public health and economic crisis.
Polling shows our race is extremely competitive and Georgia is the battleground state in an expanded Senate map against vulnerable Republican incumbents.
We can win this race, but I need you to chip in right now with less than 4 weeks left before the June 9 primary election and help me take him on. Make your first donation right now at the most critical time for our campaign to take back the Senate majority.

8,"Friend,
This Asian and Pacific Islander American Heritage Month carries with it a special significance, and much to celebrate. In the past year, several major presidential contenders of Asian and Pacific Islander heritage have run in the Democratic primary, and a new generation of political talent from these communities is at the forefront of a burgeoning progressive movement that has made Georgia a fiercely competitive general election state.
Asian Americans are the fastest growing ethnic group in Georgia. Languages like Hindi, Korean, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Mandarin Chinese, and Cantonese are being spoken in more homes every day, and these neighbors of ours contribute not only to Georgia’s rich cultural diversity, but also our growing economic power.
Unfortunately, there has been serious adversity this year. We are seeing unprecedented levels of racist scapegoating of Chinese-Americans along with the broader Asian American community by our own President. But those racist actions cannot mask his incompetent government response to the coronavirus pandemic. Unemployment now tops 14% — the highest seen since the Great Depression. Minority-owned small businesses are being wiped out, a disproportionate amount of relief benefits are going to white-owned businesses, and misguided fears of how the virus is spread — promoted by Donald Trump — have led to a spike in hate crimes against Asian Americans and the avoidance of their business establishments.
Georgia’s Asian American communities have been confronted with voter suppression, cruel family separation immigration policies, and unacceptable levels of racism, xenophobia, and religious bigotry. Our next senator must do everything she can to honor, respect, and represent all Georgians in the Senate in response not only to this pandemic, but also to the conditions that existed before it occurred.
I am grateful to have the endorsement of the progressive Asian American Advocacy Fund, the Georgia-based grassroots organization fighting this administration’s cruel policies, as well as for gay and transgender rights, a Green New Deal, and laws reflecting the mantra that Black Lives Matter. Their support in this primary means a great deal, and I will work every day to continue earning it.
Friend, we are building a multiracial, multiethnic and multifaith movement to win Georgia and flip the Senate majority in this very winnable election, but I need your help.
Please make a donation today with less than 4 weeks until our June 9 primary. Every dollar helps us reach the voters we need to win.

Jamaal Bowman for Congress
Alex,
It takes a lot to beat an entrenched incumbent. It's hard work, every single day. But Jamaal is taking on Eliot Engel because it has to be done.
For 30 years, Engel has sided with the likes of Wall Street, weapons manufacturers, and private, for-profit prisons. Time and time again, he has put these wealthy interests ahead of the people of his own district.
After seeing the real-world impact that Eliot Engel's votes have had, Jamaal decided to do something about it. He is committed to beating Engel with a grassroots, people-powered campaign that takes no money from corporate interests.
Like we said, it's hard work, every day. But it's possible because we have people like you supporting us. If you still believe in this campaign, can you chip in $15 (or whatever you can afford) to help us reach our $25,000 end-of-month goal?
Contribute $15 »
Take a look at where they each stand:
✅ Jamaal believes in progressive foreign policy, taking care of veterans, and reducing spending on foreign wars and bombs…
❌ [[URL REDACTED]] Eliot Engel voted for the Iraq war and has taken more money from the weapons manufacturers than 144 House Republicans.
✅ Jamaal supports justice reform, including the repeal of the 1994 crime bill and banning private, for-profit prisons…
❌ [[URL REDACTED]] Eliot Engel championed the 1994 crime bill and did not support HR 3227, which would have banned private prisons and detention facilities.
✅ For nearly two decades, Jamaal served as a middle school principal and as an advocate for working-class families right here in the Bronx…
❌ [[URL REDACTED]] Eliot Engel spent over three decades in Congress voting for wars, Wall Street, and prisons over education and resources for working-class families.
Jamaal is ready to fight for all of these things, as well as for other bold, progressive solutions like Medicare for All and a Green New Deal.
But taking on an entrenched incumbent is hard work, and we expect it will only get tougher until Election Day on June 23. To keep our campaign going as strong as it is, we need to reach our end-of-month goal and raise at least $25,000 by midnight on Thursday.
If everyone who reads this pitches in, we'll get there in no time. But not everyone who reads this will give. Alex, can we count on you to step up and pitch in $15 (or whatever you can) so we can meet our $25,000 end-of-month goal?

10,"This is #MyBloombergStory.
Alex,
In the early 2000s, I was a young teacher, and Bloomberg was mayor.
Stop-and-frisk was a way of life, emboldening the police and perpetuating a culture of police harassment and brutality against the Black community. One day, as I drove home from work to pick up my son, I was pulled over on the Grand Concourse in the South Bronx by the cops. They said that I failed to use my turn signal to change lanes, but I knew that was bullshit. I knew I was pulled over for DWB: Driving While Black.
I was taken out of my car, handcuffed, and arrested. I spent hours in a cell, before I was released without even seeing a judge. No charge. No explanation. No apology.
This was just one example of a terrifying, dehumanizing experience I have had with the police as a Black man in America. Some people are trying to downplay stop-and-frisk. They don’t think Bloomberg should be held responsible for championing and defending this blatant violation of constitutional rights, a policy that disproportionately impacted people of color. I ask those naysayers this:
How can the Black community improve our academic, health, or economic outcomes while we’re living in perpetual terror?
I understand the challenges facing our communities in a way the incumbent never has and never will. Perhaps that's why Engel has consistently voted for tough-on-crime policies that have decimated communities of color.
We deserve a Representative who will actively speak out against racial injustice, and won't wait to be asked. A Representative who won't just say he supports the right solutions, but will be a leader in fighting to get them passed.
I hope my story inspires more black, brown, and working-class New Yorkers to share their stories about the pain Bloomberg caused in our communities.
Bloomberg has not shown he understands the pain he caused in our community -- at all. We deserve better from our leaders; that's why I am running for Congress. My campaign is about bringing us all together, combating apathy with a movement based in love and action. I hope you will join me in that spirit.
In solidarity,
Jamaal Bowman

11,"Greetings!
Gun control policy continues to be a hot-button issue in America. Both Democrats and Republicans agree that people deserve to live in safe environments, but disagree on how to get there.
As a nation, we must all engage in this critical conversation on how we approach this sensitive issue. We all believe that everyone in this country deserves to live and thrive, which is why Rush Darwish has made his campaign slogan, “It’s About Us,” and why we call our campaign the Us Movement.
At the beginning of the campaign, Rush and the team focused on being tough on the gun crime which affects too many of our neighborhoods.
Our team has crisscrossed the 3rd District and we’ve listened to the perspectives of a lot of constituents. Here at the Us Movement, we believe that we need to take a humanitarian approach to policy and listen to the pulse of our district. That’s why we’ll be holding a town hall event on gun safety and the “straw for life” policy. We are committed to hearing all perspectives.
If you would like to attend our event and make your voice heard, we’d love to see you there.
Sincerely,

The radical House Democrats just shredded the constitution. We need to act now.
House Democrats just did what they planned all along. They voted to impeach President Trump. What was his crime? Winning an election and leading the greatest economic boom in our lifetime.
Make no mistake, this was a vote to undue the 2016 election. Kansans overwhelmingly voted for President Trump. And Washington DC liberals just tried to silence our voice.
I stand with President Trump. Where does Barbara Bollier stand? She’s going to try and stay silent. Don’t let her.
Sign the petition to let Barbara Bollier know she needs to let us know NOW if she sides with Kansans or the radical Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.
Make a donation to my campaign so I can go the Senate and Stand with President Trump.
I’m the Republicans best chance to defeat Barbara Bollier who will be a rubber stamp for Chuck Schumer.
Let’s stand. Let’s fight for our values and the constitution.

# It's Memorial Day and Black Lives Matter
#
Did Memorial Day start with this? In truth that hardly matters. This action embodies the deep respect that moved the newly emancipated Black people of Charleston, SC to so honor those who fought and died for their rights. And it was not because the calendar reminded. Nor was it so simple as putting flowers on graves. They dug and marked graves for the fallen that we might remember and bring flowers. That we remember that this nation was re-united by individuals who united in service to their country.
If we are to truly honor those who have died to defend and extend our liberties; we must actively fight for the full realization of those rights. And yes I mean that Black Lives Matter, BLM. It is symptomatic of the ills at the root of our deep divisions.
Just yesterday, Memorial Day, Minneapolis police officers with cold impunity murdered yet another black man, as several bystanders filmed. The officer below kept his weight on this man's neck even as he begged, politely, for his life. For 8 minutes. For 8 minutes as bystanders asked this brute to stop.
This individual is a brutal murderer and his partner an accomplice. It is important to understand that this is a state 'sanctioned' murder. Minnesota is one of 16 states, Florida another, that has passed a Police Bill of Rights (PBoR). These laws turn rules of evidence upside down and the investigation is an Internal Investigation. These factors make it essentially impossible to convict a police officer of any crime. The most observable effect is that every year hundreds of black men are murdered by police – with a near zero conviction rate. Pragmatic reasoning: If this were not the intended effect, the state legislators would modify the laws.
Let us celebrate Memorial Day year round by fighting in the political sphere to protect and perfect the rights that our fallen heroes bequeathed us.
That word “us” includes one's self: I have been 'talking' progressive politics since 1981 with family and friends; after I watched in dismay as Ronald Reagan destroyed the Air Traffic Controllers Union. Which had supported him - based on promises he personally made to them. I was ineffective.
Then in 2015 Bernie showed me how it's done. It is best done full-bore. And I now (2015) had Social Security AND Medicare. I had the safety net that my children, our children will not have unless we take the fight to DC. I started my campaign for U.S. Congress, FL CD03, in June 2016. It was clear that 2016 and 2018 would not be competitive – but I ran 7 days per week 12 hours per day. I was learning the ropes and building a base. The 2020 FL CD03 race is competitive. And daily more so as the dysfunction, incompetence, criminal profiteering, and total rejection of inconvenient facts have made the American response to the pandemic the object of pity around the world.
To close on BLM - what can Congress in fact do to assure that Black Lives Matter?
I propose that any injury to others by a police officers be investigated and, as warranted, prosecuted as a Federal crime. This serves the public interest that BLM represents. It also improves the police profession. As it is now individual police officers know that honest testimony against a fellow officer will be punished as 'ratting out' when that officer is almost inevitably acquitted.
The general principle is that no organization should be allowed to, nor have the moral dilemma, of investigating itself.
I am running for the U.S. Congress to bring principled solutions to this and the many other issues of Social, Economic, Racial, and Climate Justice that threaten our children's future.
I hope that you will see fit to join this campaign as a Volunteer, Intern, or Donor.

Hi ,
The United States House of Representatives did it.
They really did it.
Minutes ago, Nancy Pelosi led the House in a vote to send the articles of impeachment to the United States Senate after a month of a pathetic and failed attempt at proving there was any crime committed by our President.
You’ve got to be kidding me.
Countless Americans are being killed by criminal illegal aliens. Our national security abroad is being tested. Innocent unborn children are being aborted in the womb by the thousands. And all these do-nothing Democrats do is try to erase how you and I elected President Trump in 2016?
The trial of President Trump in the Senate could begin as soon as next week.
Now is the time you and I MUST hold every senator’s feet to the fire.
Natural security victories ✔️
Border protection victories ✔️
Pro-life victories ✔️
Unemployment at record lows ✔️
The list goes on and on.
All because of the unwavering leadership of President Trump.
The ONLY way we continue the President's legacy is to gain back control of the United States House of Representatives.
You and I have been working in the grassroots for years to prevent the destructive ways of the Democrats from wreaking any more havoc on our country. And now, we must fight harder than ever.
President Trump needs fighters alongside him in Congress and not these professional buffoons currently controlling Congress.
Will you give a gift on this historic day of
$15
$25
or
$100
To help send me to Washington D.C. to fight alongside President Trump?
With your generous support, I’ll make my way to the swamp to gain back control of the House and put an end to this nonsense.
Together, we will keep Texas red and preserve our conservative values.

Sheriff Troy Nehls No-Shows on Fort Bend County Sex Trafficking Panel and Continues to Ignore Victims
Sugar Land Conservative Kathaleen Wall Calls Out Sheriff Nehls’ For Not Facing Voters About Sex Trafficking in Fort Bend County
(Sugar Land, TX) – Sugar Land Republican Congressional Candidate (TX-22) Kathaleen Wall slams Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy Nehls for failing to show up to the Fort Bend County Panel Discussion last night hosted by Fort Bend County Judge KP George.
“In keeping with his eight-year failure to address the problem of sex-trafficking in Fort Bend County, Troy Nehls’ absence on the Panel Discussion on Sex Trafficking in Fort Bend County is deafening,” Wall said.
Panelists included Precinct 3 Constable Wayne Thompson, Fort Bend County District Attorney Brian Middleton, a special investigator from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Executive Director Micah Gamboa of the well-known anti-trafficking non-profit Elijah Rising, and other local leaders in the anti-trafficking movement.
“Troy Nehls continues to avoid the public when the topic of sex-trafficking arises and instead sends his lapdog Lieutenant Bradley Whichard in his stead,” Wall said. “The irony is not lost on voters that not only is Nehls absent, but even his subordinate Lt. Whichard employs the same tactics in his public responses by dodging questions and ignoring victims of sex trafficking like Courtney Litvak.”
Courtney Litvak’s parents, Kelly and Alan Litvak, were among the thousands of viewers for the Panel Discussion. Both continually submitted questions that went unanswered throughout the event in attempts to hold Sheriff Nehls and his office accountable for their inaction in regards to their daughter Courtney.
“Whichard even refused to acknowledge that felony crimes occurred in Fort Bend County, and instead pointed the finger at Harris County,” Wall said. “Her trafficking began at Cinco Ranch High School which does indeed fall within Fort Bend County.”
Below please find a partial script for “Courtney’s Family’s Story,” and the YouTube link here: [[URL REDACTED]]
Courtney Litvak: I was 17 and I was drawn into the life of sex trafficking as a minor.
Kelly Litvak: When we went to sit down with Sheriff Troy Nehls for a two-hour meeting… I felt so confident that he was going to immediately sound the alarms…
But instead, Sheriff Troy Nehls has …publicly blamed and shamed our family.
Alan Litvak: Sheriff Troy Nehls, knows what's going on in his county… and has the gall to re-victimize a young lady, a mom, a dad, who have been through hell.
That's not serving the public, that's harming the public.
We don't need people like Troy Nehls in Fort Bend County, or Washington, DC.
And I’d love to look you in the eye and have you tell me how you can possibly sit there and not do your job and not protect my family – because that’s what you’ve done for years.

Sheriff Troy Nehls Tries To Silence Sex Trafficking Victims He Swore To Protect
Sugar Land Conservative Kathaleen Wall Responds to Sheriff Nehls’ Attempt
to Silence Sex Trafficking Victims
(Sugar Land, TX) – Sugar Land Republican Congressional Candidate (TX-22) Kathaleen Wall today responded to a letter received from Nehls’ attorneys threatening her with legal action and calling the Litvak family liars. A copy of the letter can be found here.
“Troy Nehls hiding behind his high priced lawyers to try to silence the Litvak family is simply disgusting. Texans want a leader and not someone like Troy Nehls who will compromise on our values in Washington.” said Wall. “Nehls turned a blind eye to sexual slavery, and even called it a ‘lifestyle decision’ for one of its victims. Shame on Troy Nehls.”
“I will not be bullied by attempts to silence this family that was victimized by predators allowed to run free in Fort Bend County under Troy Nehls’ watch. And I certainly won’t let him wash his hands of the incompetence that led to rampant sex trafficking in our county and in our district.” added Wall.
""Based on how our case was handled, and others involving sexual exploitation in Fort Bend County, it is my opinion that Sheriff Nehls has carefully crafted a public image and narrative to portray Fort Bend County as a low crime community,"" mother Kelly Litvak said. ""Victims of sexual assault have been influenced to not not proceed with charges through comments from the Fort Bend County Sheriff Office like, ""Are you sure you want to file charges? It will be your word against his."" These comments to victims of sexual assault are reflected in the numbers: From 2013 to the beginning of 2020 there were 624 sexual assaults reported and only 27 arrests. This is a 4.4% arrest rate.""

For Jacob Blake and every Black person terrorized by police in this country, we must act to demand immediate accountability and dismantle systemic racism. Pramila helped the House pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act two months ago. It’s long overdue that the Senate act. Will you join Pramila in calling on the Senate to pass the House’s Justice in Policing Act to take the urgent action needed to reimagine law enforcement?
ADD YOUR NAME
The Justice in Policing Act, which the House passed two months ago, is the most aggressive policing intervention introduced by Congress in recent memory. It would reimagine and rebuild policing by ending qualified immunity, banning chokeholds, classifying lynching as a federal hate crime, establishing a public federal police misconduct registry, and demilitarizing the police. Making this legislation law is a critical first step toward securing justice for Black and Brown communities in Wisconsin, Washington state, and across the country.
We cannot become complacent in our fight to see racial justice and stop police brutality. Add your name next to Pramila’s to demand that the Senate vote to pass the Justice in Policing Act to help bring about transformative change.

Mondaire Jones for Congress
Friend,
We have come a long way from the early days when only a handful of Democratic members of Congress were willing to call for this President’s impeachment. One of the reasons I got in this race was because I was so frustrated that Democratic leadership wasn’t acting with the type of urgency required to hold this President accountable for his rampant corruption.
Now we have finally impeached this President, yet Mitch McConnell refuses to call witnesses and hold a fair trial in the Senate. In America, no one is above the law and that includes this President. We need to call on Republicans in the Senate to do the right thing and to allow a fair trial so that we can put this President’s crimes front and center for all Americans to see.
When I’m in Congress, you can always count on me to do what’s right even when it’s not politically popular or expedient. Can you make a donation today to get us across the finish line and elect someone who will always do what’s right for the residents of New York’s 17th Congressional District?

Mondaire Jones for Congress
Friend, this is a defining moment for our country.
Earlier this week, House Democrats announced that they are moving forward with two articles of impeachment against President Trump. This is a monumental step toward holding Trump accountable for his crimes and showing that no one is above the law.
The Trump Administration is coming to an end -- either through impeachment and removal from office, or through next year’s election -- but the true test of our time will be what comes after.
Who will fix the mess that Trump has made of our government? How will we set a new standard in our politics and restore the meaning of a government for the people, by the people? The answer is electing progressive champions like Mondaire Jones.
He will usher in a new wave of people-first leadership and fight for the families who have been hurt most by Trump’s administration. Will you chip in $5 to support our campaign and movement to transform our politics?
Contribute $5 »
When Trump finally leaves the White House, one way or the other, we’ll need an army of strong, progressive leaders to address the damage Trump’s made and usher in a new era of change.
Together, we will write the next chapter in American politics and make sure we come out of this moment of crisis stronger and more united than ever.
That’s why Mondaire Jones is determined to bring his bold, progressive agenda to Congress and make sure that, even after Trump, our leaders act like leaders. He’s proudly supported issues like a Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and impeachment since day 1 of his campaign: there’s no doubt he’ll be just as fearless fighting for us in Congress.
But Mondaire can’t do this by himself: he needs a grassroots army at his side to make sure he can win this race and actually make it to Congress. Please chip in $5 now so Team Mondaire has the resources to spread our message and stay competitive.

21,"It’s been a difficult week to be black in America. I’d be lying if I said I haven’t cried often in between rallying for justice and campaigning for Congress.
Friend,
It’s been a difficult week to be black in America. I’d be lying if I said I haven’t cried often in between rallying for justice and campaigning for Congress.
Last week alone, a woman named Amy Cooper called the NYPD and lied about an “African-American man” threatening her life in Central Park. In actuality, that man had simply asked Ms. Cooper to leash her dog, which would have brought her into compliance with a well-publicized rule. In Louisville, Kentucky, protests intensified over the shooting death by police officers in March of an unarmed black woman named Breonna Taylor, whose home police officers barged into shortly after midnight in search of two men believed to be selling drugs. And on May 28th, a horrific video surfaced showing Derek Chauvin, an officer with the Minneapolis Police Department, slowly murder in broad daylight an unarmed black man, George Floyd, as other officers stood by and did nothing.
Black Americans like me are constantly retraumatized by these stories and images. We are tired of having to march, protest, and riot to get justice from governments whose job it is to deliver it. And we are tired of watching police officers brutalize and kill us with impunity.
But we know these problems run much deeper than police violence. Institutional racism is everywhere.
Institutional racism pervades our criminal legal system. Black people are arrested at disproportionately high rates, including in New York’s 17th Congressional District. Black people are more likely to be prosecuted than white people who are arrested for the same crimes. And black people are sentenced more harshly than white people convicted for the same crimes.
Institutional racism is also present throughout our economic system. The net worth of the average white household is 10 times that of the average black household. Black people are less likely to grow up in school districts with quality public schools, and more likely to graduate college with significant student debt. Black people are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured, and more likely to contract -- and die from -- preventable ailments like diabetes and asthma. Black people are more likely to experience homelessness or live in homes that endanger their health, and less likely to have access to public transit.
The protests we are seeing are not just about George Floyd. They are not even just about police killings. They are an expression of deep frustration with systems and leadership that shortchange black people, and a government that is at best indifferent to our plight.
Weeks like this redouble my commitment to change that reality.
In NY-17, I am humbled to fight alongside thousands of people of all ages, orientations, genders, colors, economic backgrounds, and creeds, to advance the cause of racial justice. As I watch my opponents scramble to add criminal justice reform -- something I have called for since the moment I entered this race -- to their platforms, or suddenly co-sponsor a policing reform bill that has been sitting before their state legislative bodies for years, I am reminded that we desperately need people in office who do not need nationwide protests to treat racial injustice with urgency. Black people shouldn’t have to take to the streets for our elected officials to lift the boot off of our throats. That’s why we need people in office for whom policy is personal.
The problems we face are human-made, and they can be solved. A better world can be ours if we fight for it. Together, we are going to bring the change this district and our country so desperately need.
In solidarity,
Mondaire

We are closely monitoring the situation and its effects on the people of Texas and our nation as we work together to keep our families and communities safe.
Friends,
The Texas GOP is just full of surprises (not really). Once again, Attorney General Ken Paxton has gone off the rails — seven of his top aides called for an investigation into multiple crimes that include bribery and abuse of power.
But this shouldn’t surprise Texans. Ken Paxton has a well-known track record of being a political hack and a criminal.
He’s threatened to prosecute Texans who vote by mail. Undermined Roe v. Wade by backing a ban on nearly all abortions during the pandemic, fighting all the way to the Supreme Court. Tried to eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act with no replacement for over a million Texans. And let’s not forget, he was indicted since 2015 for securities fraud.
Ken Paxton has always been a loose cannon who needs to resign and be held accountable. Pitch in $25 to help Texas Democrats bring accountability back in November >>>
This is the kind of leadership we’ll continue to see in Texas if we don’t do something to stop it. We need to fight harder than ever to flip the Texas House Blue on November 3rd and ensure we have progressive leaders who are willing to put public service above self-service. Let’s do this.

There’s only one way forward, now.
In the impeachment trial of Donald Trump, the United States Senate has just voted to acquit him of crimes against our democracy. They chose a cover-up instead of a true trial, and in doing so, they failed us. They failed to listen to the will of the American people, failed to uphold the oath they swore to protect our Constitution, and failed to put country over party.
When Republicans side with a corrupt, lawless president out of blind party loyalty, we show up to call them out as cowards. When Mr. Trump brags about all that he can get away with, we show up to prove him wrong.
Like you, I’m sure, I’m outraged. I’m disappointed. I wish things had gone differently. But I urge you, hold on to this hurt and vote with it. It’s time we remind Washington, DC who they actually answer to: you and your voice. Real change happens when we come together — join me and let’s take down corruption in November.
There is only one path forward to removing Donald Trump from office. Commit to vote, right now — this is our last chance to beat Trump. We can’t afford to miss it.
Fired up,
Tom

Yesterday, Joe Biden picked his running mate — Senator Kamala Harris. I couldn’t be more excited. Having spent years working with her, she has shown time and time again that she is a champion for the people.
(On the campaign trail in South Carolina.)
In 2015, I was proud to support her first Senate campaign, and now I’m proud to support her historic run to become the first female, first Black, and first Asian-American Vice President. We must do all we can to ensure that she and Joe are elected in November. We must make sure that the Biden-Harris ticket has all they need to win. Join me by making a donation to this historic ticket today.
Donate to the Biden-Harris ticket
Kamala’s record speaks to her commitment to representing the people, not corporations and the 1%. As California’s Attorney General:
* She created the first-ever unit focused on environmental justice.
* She took on the big banks on behalf of California homeowners and won $20 billion.
* She defended the Obama-Biden Clean Power Plan and New Source Standards.
As a Senator, she held the Trump administration accountable for their crimes against the American people with her work on the Senate’s Judiciary and Intelligence committees. She grilled Donald Trump’s anti-choice judicial nominations. Recently, she introduced the COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force Act to address the administration’s failed response to the pandemic.
Kamala will be an incredible partner to Joe as they work to not only heal America from the Trump administration’s reign, but to build a better America. Together, their shared vision for this country will give us all a reason to go to the polls beyond just ousting Mr. Trump.
I look forward to doing everything I can from now until November to support the Biden-Harris ticket and elect Democrats up and down the ballot who will tackle our climate crisis and racial injustice. Start by making a donation to the Biden-Harris ticket today.
Let’s win this,
Tom

26,"And stop asking the military to police. My op-ed ➡
Friends and neighbors,
In my op-ed published yesterday by WBUR's Cognoscenti, I argue that after September 11th, government at all levels — federal, state, local — increasingly flipped the idea of policing on its head. State and local police were given more military and intelligence capabilities, while troops overseas were tasked with policing foreign soil.
As a former platoon commander in Afghanistan, and as the current chair of the public safety committee for the Newton City Council, I understand how these challenges are interwoven. As your next member of Congress, I'll work to tackle both.
Read my full op-ed below (and share).
Onwards,
Jake
After 9/11, Policing Underwent Radical Change. It’s Time To Course Correct
Contrary to the president’s claims, the protests of the last weeks have been overwhelmingly peaceful. Yet, we see the tools of war on our streets. Police and the National Guard patrol with the weapons and armor that I recognize from my overseas deployments in the Marines.
We must demilitarize the police. To do this, we must shift the paradigm of public safety, at home and abroad.
After September 11th, government at all levels — federal, state, local — increasingly flipped the idea of policing on its head. State and local police were given more military and intelligence capabilities, while troops overseas were tasked with policing foreign soil.
The new Department of Homeland Security became a bridge between the two. From airports to subways to street corners, our everyday experience became marked by lurking threats that required overwhelming force. We were all deputized to ""say something,"" if we ""see something.""
Conversely, our troops are deployed as police. That includes me. As an infantry platoon commander in Helmand Province, my mission was to patrol three villages subject to Taliban influence. In tandem with the Afghan police, we tried to establish rapport with tribal elders, to root out Taliban abettors and to generally underwrite security. Marines are expeditionary — we are meant to take on unfamiliar missions. But we are not police.
Our military is policing villages that are not their own, and our police are empowered to act with military force. These twin failed initiatives must stop: get the military and intelligence services out of our public square here at home, and stop using our military as a police force overseas. As monumental as ending the forever wars would be, it is the former — the demilitarization of police — that will be the harder call to action.
Each city and town can begin by looking at dispatches and details. How often are cops being asked to control traffic? Cite noise violators? Handle substance abuse? And, how often would recourse to force have been necessary to protect public safety?
As the chair of the public safety and transportation committee on the Newton City Council, I am helping to steer that review for my hometown. I expect we'll find that we're asking police to not just keep us safe from violent crime, but also to handle every other assignment that has rolled downhill from law to enforcement, without due consideration for the right agent to enforce.
In some cases, it's already obvious it's not working. For example: Newton police are being called on landscapers whose leaf blowers are too loud. By expanding the surface area of police-citizen contact into these types of non-threatening situations, we increase the likelihood of violence — especially violence predicated on racial profiling.
Race must be at the center of this review. Collecting data on policing and racism should become a national project, but we can’t let this be a statistics discussion when Black and brown voices on the subject have been clear for centuries: our fellow Americans do not trust law enforcement. As a white man, I feel safer when cops are nearby. Many of my Black and brown constituents do not, and for good reason.
Ending the 9/11 mindset, and reviewing police functions through the lens of racial justice, will be good for both citizens and police. To be sure, we need a public safety arm that can use force to protect people — nobody wants to dial 911 during a robbery and get a ringtone. But we have taken the right of government to use force and spread it across domains where force is rarely helpful.
I’m proud that we’re starting this conversation in my hometown’s City Hall, along with cities and towns throughout the United States. To complete it, though, will take action from Washington, too. Stop militarizing the police. And stop asking the military to police other peoples. From my patrol base in Helmand to my chair at the public safety committee, I know we can do better.

27,"Hey,
If you weren't paying attention to the GOP Convention speaker list, here's one you need to know: Matt Gaetz.
Tonight, on a national stage, Gaetz will sing Trump's praises -- in spite of every crisis Trump created for us, every occasion he utterly failed to rise to, and every burden he put on the backs of the American people.
There's no telling what Gaetz will say exactly, but we'd wager it'll be divisive, tone-deaf, ignorant, self-promotional, and so boastful you'll want to throw your television straight into the garbage.
What Gaetz should be doing, instead of soaking up the limelight, is working with partners in the Senate to deliver relief for communities suffering from the coronavirus. He should be holding Trump accountable for his crimes. He should be apologizing for failing to serve our district with the honor and integrity we deserve.
Let's make this the first and last time we see Gaetz speaking as a congressman at the GOP Convention. Chip in $5 or more now to return honor and integrity to Florida's 1st by electing Phil Ehr to Congress.

28,"NEW POLL: 43% vs. 44%
Hey,
This poll is exactly what we were hoping for.
Floridians have been watching Gaetz spend his time in office sucking up to Donald Trump, providing cover for his crimes and lies, and promoting himself on cable news.
But voters realize that it's not Matt's time he's wasting -- it's our time. Time that could be spent protecting our coastline from pollution, time that could be spent fixing our broken health care system, time that could be spent empowering working families.
We know because only 43% of poll respondents said they'd vote to re-elect Gaetz. And 44% said they're considering voting for someone else or will confidently vote to replace him.
Floridians are done letting Gaetz waste any more of our precious time. This November, we'll elect Phil Ehr to Congress where he'll fight for working families and uphold our shared values.
We can defeat Matt Gaetz and return honor and integrity to Congress -- but we can't do it without your help. Chip in $5 or more now and tell Matt Gaetz his time is up!

29,"Friend,
Right now, our nation faces one of its greatest threats ever -- a crisis of leadership.
Everyday Matt Gaetz and Donald Trump work to sow doubt in the American system, divide us along party lines, and create chaos in order to cover up their crimes and stay in power.
They’re waging a war on the very people they’re supposed to serve.
During my 26-year military career I watched the enemy use these tactics, but never thought I’d see the day when American leaders would use it against their own people.
But, the tide is turning. Americans nationwide are yearning for an end to the chaos and division. They want real leadership.
That’s why I’m running.
Tomorrow our historic campaign will release our most powerful ad to date. When people see our new ad, they’ll know the change our nation so desperately needs has arrived.
But, because we are not funded by big corporations and the 1% like my opponent, we rely on grassroots donors like you -- so please chip in what you can to help us reach as many voters as possible with our new ad.

30,"Hello --
I'm happy to share that, thanks to the unwavering commitment of our volunteers, the hard work of my team, and the incredible support of grassroots donors:
I'm officially your 2020 Democratic nominee to replace Matt Gaetz.
When I set out to defeat Matt Gaetz and restore honor and integrity to Congress, I knew it would be a tough mission. Because Matt's proven himself a master of self-promotion and has done a great job to make sure all eyes are on him.
But there's a downside to this strategy: Every time Gaetz decides to shirk his constitutional duties or defend Trump from crimes or crisis -- each and every one of us is watching him do it.
What we've seen is nothing short of vile and morally bankrupt.
He caused a political spectacle by charging doors during impeachment proceedings. He threatened witnesses via Twitter. And he downplayed the dangers of the coronavirus on the House floor.
The time for change is now, team. We can give Gaetz the boot and finally lead our district with the honor and integrity we deserve.
But if we're going to take this fight all the way to Washington, I need to continue leaning on your strength. We've only got 76 days left in the general election to put in the work and retire Matt Gaetz. If you're with me, chip in $5 or more now to help do it.

Hi Alex,
My name is Bill Olson, and I am a conservative Christian combat vet running to take back a Swing district - Florida’s 9th District, currently held by liberal Democrat Darren Soto.
As a decorated U.S. Army vet who saw combat in the Middle East, my country- and our freedoms- mean something to me!
Along the way, I was recognized for my service: four Army Achievement Medals, the Army Commendation Medal, and two Meritorious Service Medals.
I also received an additional Army Commendation Medal for my meritorious service in liberating Kuwait during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, and in 2008 I was awarded the Bronze Star for exceptionally meritorious service during the global war on terror in Afghanistan.
So you can imagine, being an Army lifer, that serving my country - protecting my country and our freedoms - is a VERY big deal to me!
That said, what I am MOST proud of, is that my passion for serving my country was passed on to my three sons.
I am NOT a career politician…. Just someone who spent most of his adult life, risking my life for your freedom.
here is nothing I’d rather do - I’m a fighter and I love my country and my fellow citizens!
Now I want to take that fighting spirit to Congress- and Nancy Pelosi and her band of Socialists don’t stand a chance.
I’m running against a career politician: Democrat Darren Soto.
I need your help today \- to replace Darren Soto, stop the radicals in Congress, stop impeachment and win Florida for the Republicans! Can you help me?
Liberal Democrat Darren Soto did not serve in the military. Instead, he votes with AOC and her anti-American ""Squad"" over 95% of the time!
I think those who have laid the most on the line for our country and its citizens- whose who have taken an Oath to defend the Constitution- are the ones best fit to defend our Constitution in Congress.
I always knew Darren Soto was bad, but when the Conservative Review Liberty Scorecards came out, we found out just how bad...
Darren Soto got 17% for the last Congress- an ""F"" rating.
His score is nearly identical to Speaker Pelosi, because Soto is Nancy Pelosi's lap dog - he sold his voting card to her a long time ago!
Soto votes every time to fund Planned Parenthood.
He votes for gun control - every time.
What really upsets me is that Soto's Democrats went all-in on impeaching the President. They have become SO radicalized, they impeached the President for nothing more than political payback!
Time for that to stop!
Me, I’m not a career politician. I don't have a fancy family pedigree.
I earned my education in the Cold War frontiers of Germany and South Korea, as well as the battlefields of Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan. That's why I'm 100% behind the President's ""America First"" policies!
I’m running to fight for American greatness, American peace, and American pride.
I am a Christian conservative. I believe that when you swear an oath to defend the Constitution, that oath has no expiration date!
Impeachment was never supposed to be a method of resolving our political disputes. It's supposed to be a rare way to remove a President who has committed high crimes.
President Trump is innocent! And he is a great President and a great American. We must defend him and re-elect him!
This isn't what the Constitution envisioned. This sad spectacle of partisan revenge is not what America is!
President Trump is innocent! We need to make sure the crazy Democrats pay dearly for what they are doing. And we do that at the ballot box!
And for that, Florida will be key.
In 2016, President Trump won by expanding the field, winning in places Republicans hadn't won lately.
The Democrats in 2020 are trying to return the favor- trying to win in Florida.
Let's be clear - there is NO Republican win in 2020 without Florida.
Florida is so pivotal. The electoral votes, along with so many Republican-leaning and swing congressional districts, make this state of paramount importance.
Plus, it's now President Trump's home state!
People here have no tolerance for the Dems' impeachment scam. They have no tolerance for the crazy policies and socialism.
We are red-blooded Americans! Democrats like AOC and her extremism have no place here.
Me? I'm a working class guy who loves God and my country. I'm 100% behind the President's ""America First"" policies!
Perhaps you agree with me, that we need more Bible, more Constitution - and less crazy liberal Democrats like Darren Soto.
If so, then I need your help!
Darren Soto will have all of Nancy Pelosi's Swamp money. That's why I need your help today- to replace Darren Soto, and support the President!
Can you help me?
I need to raise $23,500 before the end of this month to let the people of Central Florida know about Soto's liberal record.
Can I count on you for a donation of $25, $50, $100, $250, $500, $1000.... all the way to the Federal maximum donation of $2800 per individual, $5600 per couple?
The Democrats are going to lose next year \- but only if we let the American people know what they have done. It's up to us!
Let's get this done!

Hi Alex,
My name is Bill Olson, and I am a conservative Christian combat vet running to take back Florida’s competitive 9th District, currently held by Socialist Democrat Darren Soto. And I need your help to be YOUR champion in Congress!
I am a Christian. As a Christian, we are taught to love, even your enemies.
That is why I don't understand the blind hatred the Democrats seem to have these days- against our country, against our history, against our very citizens!
Consider the actions of the Dems just in the last few weeks:
-Tearing down historical statues, even when it's illegal to do so. In Portland, mobs tore down statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson; in Richmond, Governor ""Radical Ralph"" Northam has torn down many statues along the city's famous Monument Ave. The DNC even came out swinging against historic Mt. Rushmore! It clearly doesn't matter if they are confederate statues or not; it's America they hate!
-Abolishing the police, depriving citizens of needed protection against violent crime. Look at what Joe Biden has now embraced:
It's clear Joe Biden's far left advisers are starting to change his stance on policing in America.
During an interview Wednesday with leftist publication This Now, Biden said the police are over militarized, have ""become the enemy"" and said funding should ""absolutely"" be reallocated elsewhere. In other words, he's advocating for the defunding of law enforcement as crime across the country continues to skyrocket.
-Depriving us of our Constitutionally-guaranteed rights, including our freedom of speech and freedom to worship.
The U.S. Constitution is also being tested in unprecedented ways, with religious leaders from Mississippi to Kentucky to San Diego County suing their governments, asserting that they are being treated differently from businesses that can remain open, such as supermarkets and liquor stores.
What is most disturbing is that the Supreme Court has backed California's restrictions on Freedom of Worship.
-Condoning violence by mobs.
House Democrats unanimously blocked a resolution condemning acts of violence and rioting—including the ""deliberate targeting of law enforcement officers""—in the wake of George Floyd's death.
The resolution, which was introduced by Rep. Greg Steube (R., Fla.) late Thursday morning, condemned Floyd's killing at the hands of police, calling it ""inconsistent with the values and conduct expected of law enforcement officers."" The resolution also supported peaceful protesters, but it noted that protests have been ""exploited by violent extremists"" carrying out ""acts of violence, looting, destruction of business and personal property, and additional loss of life.""
Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio) spoke in favor of the resolution, arguing that while Floyd's death was ""wrong as wrong could be,"" there is a ""big difference between peaceful protest and rioting."" Jordan also spoke against defunding the police, calling it ""one of the craziest public policy proposals I have ever seen.""
Image
It is now clear that the Democrats, including my opponent Darren Soto, have been swept away by extremism, with the most fringe Stalinist parts of their base now driving the party's agenda. These ain't Kennedy's Democrats- they have more in common with Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communists!
Image
I fought for our country in Iraq and Afghanistan. My sons and I have served our country for decades- and when you take the oath to defend the Constitution, it has no expiration date!
I will defend our country and our Constitution against the Democrats' anti-American extremism. Will you stand with me?
Our district now knows that there is a better way forward- one which does not include overthrowing the Constitution and the entire American system- as Ilhan Omar now advocates:
Rep. Ilhan Omar says America is a giant “system of oppression” needing an immediate “dismantling” far beyond current calls for criminal justice reform.
“We can’t stop at criminal justice reform or policing reform,” she said during an outdoor press conference. “We are not merely fighting to tear down the systems of oppression in the criminal justice system. We are fighting to tear down systems of oppression that exist in housing, in education, in health care, in employment, [and] in the air we breathe.”
Image
It's hard to believe, but this kind of Communist Revolution is now what the Dems, led by AOC and Ilhan Omar, advocate. That's why it's important to stand up for America- right now!
Now, I'm not a slick fundraiser or polished politician. I'm don't have Pelosi's Swampy millions, which is why I need your help!
I need your help today- to replace Darren Soto, defend America and support the President!
I need your help to stand up for the Constitution and against Communism!
Can you help me? Florida is SO important for the Republicans. It's now the President's hme state, with many swing districts like mine!
Can I count on you for a donation of $15, $35, $60, $250, $500, $1000.... all the way to the Federal maximum donation of $2800 per individual, $5600 per couple?
I appreciate whatever you can send so we can defeat socialist Darren Soto!
I'm going to make sure the radical Democrats lose BIG this year \- with your help!

Consider the actions of the Dems just in the last few weeks:
-Tearing down historical statues, even when it's illegal to do so. In Portland, mobs tore down statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson; in Richmond, Governor ""Radical Ralph"" Northam has torn down many statues along the city's famous Monument Ave. The DNC even came out swinging against historic Mt. Rushmore! It clearly doesn't matter if they are confederate statues or not; it's America they hate!
-Abolishing the police, depriving citizens of needed protection against violent crime. Look at what Joe Biden has now embraced:
It's clear Joe Biden's far left advisers are starting to change his stance on policing in America.
During an interview Wednesday with leftist publication This Now, Biden said the police are over militarized, have ""become the enemy"" and said funding should ""absolutely"" be reallocated elsewhere. In other words, he's advocating for the defunding of law enforcement as crime across the country continues to skyrocket.
-Depriving us of our Constitutionally-guaranteed rights, including our freedom of speech and freedom to worship.
The U.S. Constitution is also being tested in unprecedented ways, with religious leaders from Mississippi to Kentucky to San Diego County suing their governments, asserting that they are being treated differently from businesses that can remain open, such as supermarkets and liquor stores.
What is most disturbing is that the Supreme Court has backed California's restrictions on Freedom of Worship.
-Condoning violence by mobs.
House Democrats unanimously blocked a resolution condemning acts of violence and rioting—including the ""deliberate targeting of law enforcement officers""—in the wake of George Floyd's death.
The resolution, which was introduced by Rep. Greg Steube (R., Fla.) late Thursday morning, condemned Floyd's killing at the hands of police, calling it ""inconsistent with the values and conduct expected of law enforcement officers."" The resolution also supported peaceful protesters, but it noted that protests have been ""exploited by violent extremists"" carrying out ""acts of violence, looting, destruction of business and personal property, and additional loss of life.""
Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio) spoke in favor of the resolution, arguing that while Floyd's death was ""wrong as wrong could be,"" there is a ""big difference between peaceful protest and rioting."" Jordan also spoke against defunding the police, calling it ""one of the craziest public policy proposals I have ever seen.""

It is now clear that the Democrats, including my opponent Darren Soto, have been swept away by extremism, with the most fringe Stalinist parts of their base now driving the party's agenda. These ain't Kennedy's Democrats- they have more in common with Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communists!

I will defend our country and our Constitution against the Democrats' anti-American extremism. Will you stand with me?
Our district now knows that there is a better way forward- one which does not include overthrowing the Constitution and the entire American system- as Ilhan Omar now advocates:
Rep. Ilhan Omar says America is a giant “system of oppression” needing an immediate “dismantling” far beyond current calls for criminal justice reform.
“We can’t stop at criminal justice reform or policing reform,” she said during an outdoor press conference. “We are not merely fighting to tear down the systems of oppression in the criminal justice system. We are fighting to tear down systems of oppression that exist in housing, in education, in health care, in employment, [and] in the air we breathe.”

It's hard to believe, but this kind of Communist Revolution is now what the Dems, led by AOC and Ilhan Omar, advocate. That's why it's important to stand up for America- right now!
Now, I'm not a slick fundraiser or polished politician. I'm don't have Pelosi's Swampy millions, which is why I need your help!
I need your help today- to replace Darren Soto, defend America and support the President!
I need your help to stand up for the Constitution and against Communism!
Can you help me? Florida is SO important for the Republicans. It's now the President's hme state, with many swing districts like mine!
Can I count on you for a donation of $15, $35, $60, $250, $500, $1000.... all the way to the Federal maximum donation of $2800 per individual, $5600 per couple?

36,"ಠ_ಠ Pelosi says she's not ಠ_ಠ
Alex,
Last weekend, supporters of our campaign posted more than 200,000 tweets on #PelosiMustGo, pushing it to the #1 trending position on Twitter for over 12 hours! Our campaign gained 5,000 new followers in the course of a day!
That’s phenomenal, but we’re not stopping there. We’re continuing to spread the word to everyone, both nationwide and here in San Francisco.
When the hashtag was trending, we took a poll to find out why more and more voters want her gone. Here’s what we learned:
She’s “not a big fan” of Medicare for All. Pelosi used these exact words. She doesn’t support it, and never will, because her allies receive huge contributions from the pharmaceutical & health insurance industries. Even during this pandemic, her advice was to “hydrate and pray.” That’s not much help to the 138,000 Americans who’ve already died from COVID-19.
CHIP IN TODAY SO WE CAN 🥤🥤🥤HYDRATE AND PRAY🙏🙏🙏
Her game show politics don’t help working people. Pelosi dressed in African kente cloth, but forgot George Floyd’s name and fell far short of community demands to defund the police and invest in more effective alternatives to secure public safety. She ripped up Trump’s State of the Union speech, but supported his obscene military budget, expanded his surveillance powers, and approved his corporate bailout plans. Asked about her response to the pandemic, Pelosi talked not about working people who need universal paid sick leave, or rent relief—neither of which she supports—but about her gourmet ice cream collection. Like Trump, she’s basically a reality TV star who governs by theater rather than substance, with predictably bad results.
She’s a real estate tycoon who doesn’t speak for SF. Pelosi has something else in common with Trump: both of them are real estate tycoons born with silver spoons in their mouths to powerful east coast families. Pelosi and her husband are owners of multiple mansions and hotels, worth over $100 million, and investors in many other commercial properties, including one that received a PPP government loan of $1 million. They’ve also participated in select (not publicly available) investment opportunities while Nancy passed laws favoring enterprises in which they’ve invested.
She never stands up to Trump’s bad budgets. Whether it’s his bloated war allotments, his bailouts and tax breaks for billionaires and corporations, or his expansion of spying on U.S. citizens, Nancy Pelosi has come through for our criminal president time after time. And while she likes to brag about having impeached him, she limited the process to the weakest possible case—effectively excusing all of his worst crimes, including his corruption, which has sparked bipartisan concerns and could have removed him from the White House.
We’re doing what no one thought we could, and forcing Pelosi to abandon her long-established positions to support policies she never has before. We’re winning against all odds, but we can’t win in November without you. Can you make a contribution today so we can send Pelosi packing?
She’s waffled on Black Lives Matter and Defunding the Police. Not only has Nancy Pelosi stated she’s against defunding the police (which Minneapolis has already done), but her police reform bill was 10 years behind the times, filled with no-brainers like a chokehold ban, which should have become federal policy back in the Rodney King days. It’s not good enough, and falls short of community demands to defund police. In fact, Pelosi’s latest proposal would further expand police budgets!
But enough about Nancy Pelosi.
I want to sincerely thank you for all your efforts. With your help, we’re spreading the word that after 33 years of blocking change and enabling the GOP, Pelosi must finally go.
We’re happy to help make it happen, alongside you.
Thanks for your support,
Shahid

Alex,
Today we have big news out of San Francisco: District Attorney Chesa Boudin has ended the use of cash bail in all criminal cases!
Previously, when people were arrested in a criminal case they were held in jail until their trial unless they could they could provide “cash bail”—a large amount of money—to the court. The money is later returned if the defendant appears at all their court dates, though this can be weeks or even months later.
This system unfairly targeted low income people whose families are less likely to have cash on-hand. This means that low income defendants who have not been convicted of a crime were held in jail longer than their wealthy peers and lose their job or worse.

Ending cash bail was one of Chesa’s campaign promises, and one of the many reasons I endorsed and campaigned alongside him.
The more progressives we elect to office the more we can accomplish.
Bernie Sanders spoke out in support of Chesa Boudin’s decision today and of ending cash bail nationwide. In order to accomplish this, it’s critical that we not only elect Bernie as President but that we elect a progressive congress ready to support his agenda.

38,"Trump’s escalation risks a war we can neither afford nor justify.
Alex,
Yesterday, news emerged that our criminal President authorized the assassination of Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani. We stand at the brink of a conflict that our country can neither justify nor afford.
Can you stand with us as we challenge this latest military escalation?
Assassinating a foreign leader is an act of war. Journalists have compared the act to the assassination of either the U.S. Vice President or a high-ranking military general.
Trump’s actions are irresponsible. Equally irresponsible, however, were the congressional leaders who just approved his $738 billion defense funding request.
Speaker Pelosi bears particular responsibility.
Not only did Pelosi oppose—and successfully defeat—two proposed amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act that would have prevented Trump’s escalation, but she continues to impose House rules that deny House Members access to classified secrets.
In other words, Speaker Pelosi actively supports executive secrecy and unilateralism, even while pursuing a late, limited, and ultimately theatrical impeachment process that failed to address the President’s worse crimes against our Republic.
Would you rather see San Francisco represented in Washington by a voice promoting peace and accountability?
Trump failed to ask for permission from Congress before committing an act of war that he is constitutionally not authorized to initiate. And, strikingly, no one seems to be asking how we plan to pay for yet another war of aggression.
But militarism is reprehensible for other reasons. It is reprehensible because it diverts public resources from social needs like healthcare and affordable housing. It is reprehensible because it consumes human lives. It is especially reprehensible because it is often bipartisan.
We’ve been down this road before. After Bush’s invasion of Iraq, a million civilians died, alongside 4,500 U.S. troops. Another 32,000 were wounded and will never be the same. In Afghanistan, 2,500 U.S. troops died while another 20,500 have been wounded. Over 100,000 Afghans have died.
This morning, Speaker Pelosi wrote that “American leaders’ highest priority is to protect American lives and interests.” But protecting American (usually, corporate) “interests” has cost the lives of too many Americans, and far more civilians from other countries.
Now, more than ever, we must say “no” to war, and take action to challenge militarism. We deserve leaders and representatives who will stand with us.
I've been arrested participating in direct action to stop a war. I've organized mass demonstrations to pull the plug on a corporate invasion. Today, we’ll be joining a demonstration at Powell & Market from noon until 2pm, and invite you to join us there.
In Congress, I'll continue to wage peace. My experience uniquely situates me to enter Congress as an agent of change.
Will you stand with me—and with global peace & justice—today?

39,"Alex,
When I saw that House Democrats were passing something called the “Justice in Policing Act,” I have to admit that just for a moment, I thought that in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, and millions of Black Lives Matter activists in the streets, they’d finally done something right.
I wish!
This Pelosi-endorsed bill would require federal police to wear body cameras, and also includes funding for local cops to do the same. While that might sound good, it’s actually a slap in the face to both justice and privacy. Here’s why:
We need major limits on the role of police in our society, not body cams or baby steps. Can you contribute to unseating Pelosi and breaking the establishment’s chokehold on justice?
* Body cams only provide recordings of isolated incidents, not patterns of violent behavior, so they can’t help weed out abusive cops
* Body cams don’t record cops themselves, only what they see—so they rarely offer evidence of widespread police violence & brutality captured by broader angles, such as those captured by dashboard cameras or third party videos.
* A recent study shows that body cams don’t reduce crime, don’t improve police accountability, and are mostly used against citizens, not violent police
* Finally, in our estimation, body cams, which again record only citizens and not police, are a huge violation of Fourth Amendment privacy rights
I’m proud to have fought for decades on the front lines of the civil rights and justice reform movements. Believe me when I say that the so-called Justice in Policing Act is a 10-year-old solution to a modern problem. That solution might have been barely adequate then, but not now.
What we need now, and what Minneapolis is already doing, is to significantly defund the police and redistribute that funding to social work, mental health services, and community programs—while also actively demilitarizing the police so they look like the people they’re serving, not storm troopers straight out of STAR WARS.
Can you chip in and help us win, so the true justice reform we’ve advocated for decades—and that other prominent voices agree with—can finally become a reality?

Thanks for standing with us,

40,"When Donald Trump ordered the deployment of chemical weapons to clear protesters in order to get a photo op of himself holding up a Bible, what was Pelosi’s response?
Alex,
Black people have been subjugated in our country since even before our Republic was founded. That’s why saying “Black Lives Matter” is important—and actually doing something about it, even more so.
Yet when asked, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has never been able to bring herself to say the phrase without adding that “all lives matter.” That might seem innocuous, but carries disturbing implications under the circumstances, overlooking centuries of racial oppression.
Pelosi hasn’t been up to the task. Protests challenging police brutality have made that crystal clear. She mouths concern for racial justice, having spent 30 years undermining it.
I’ve spent the last 20 years advancing racial justice, from the streets to courtrooms and the halls of Congress, as a national advocate for civil rights and civil liberties. Can you support our campaign to take those concerns to the House?
Earlier today, I shared some thoughts about the uprising that we are witnessing together around the country.

And the vicious police brutality we've seen to suppress dissent threatens not only racial justice activists, but also our democracy writ large.

When Donald Trump ordered the deployment of chemical weapons to clear protesters in order to get a photo op of himself holding up a Bible, what was Pelosi’s response?
Outrage?
A bill to demilitarize police?
She held up a second Bible and encouraged our criminal president to change his ways.
My take is vastly different.

Our campaign proposes a 20-point platform to transform criminal justice that covers profiling, police militarization, ending the drug war, cutting mandatory minimum sentences, restricting deadly force, prohibiting cash bail, ending qualified immunity to support the prosecution of cops who kill, providing multiple paths for at-risk youth, and much more.
Meanwhile, Pelosi offers platitudes and empty rhetoric.
Can you help us take a big step toward real justice reform by replacing the leading corporate Democrat with a civil rights champion?
We’re serious about replacing Nancy Pelosi. And I’m equally serious about making America an equitable, just, inclusive and fair, safe place for Black Americans. As an immigrant of color, I understand how institutions prey on vulnerable communities, including black people, immigrants, and people of color.
I’m running for Congress to do everything I can to help. Thank you for standing with me!
In solidarity,
Shahid

41,"With a week to go, I wanted to talk directly to you
Dear Friends:
I was hoping to be in a race marked by integrity, but unfortunately, that isn’t to be the case. Pete Meijer started a negative campaign just hours after saying how harmful that was to communities and political races. Now his claims have become ludicrous and desperate--because I’m winning.
Meijer has been twisting my record in ways that were unimaginable to me when I got into this race. It has been ugly. It has been untruthful. And it has shown a lack of integrity or character from an entitled young man who is accustomed to getting his way and who will lie to do just that. But it’s not a huge surprise that someone like him would distort a record or would allow for attacks on his own supporters – because he doesn’t want to talk about things that matter, like this:
* Why he founded an organization that gave to NANCY PELOSI and to nine other Democrats [Federal Election Commission] who won, helped Pelosi become Speaker and who ALL voted to impeach the president. [[[URL REDACTED]] 660 Vote 604].
* Why in 2016, just two weeks after Access Hollywood aired its hit piece on President Trump and as the establishment was abandoning the president, he donated to a group formed to “oppose Trump’s corrupt agenda of hate.” [Federal Election Commission, 10/14/16]; [Common Defense website]
* Why in a 2017 op-ed, he called the Trump White House “a backdrop of half-truths and outright lies” [Task & Purpose Op-Ed, 3/17/17]
* Why he gave the maximum donation to his friend Justin Amash in December 2017, after nearly a year of Amash battling and belittling the president. [Federal Election Commission, 12/31/17]
Perhaps he would like to set the record straight.
That’s exactly what I want to do, in view of some of Meijer’s ludicrous statements about me:
1. I signed a pledge to never raise your taxes—and I’m the only candidate who did that. Why?
2. The attacks on me by Pete Meijer and Tom Norton that I raised taxes by $100 million are outright lies. We passed legislation (110-0 in the House and 38-0 in the Senate) that leveled the playing field so Michigan businesses wouldn’t get screwed by Amazon. This is complete hypocrisy on Pete Meijer’s part because Meijer Inc. and its trade association supported this legislation and gave me their Legislator of the Year award for getting it passed.
3. I have been clear on my stance regarding my support of the President since the beginning of the campaign. Though Pete Meijer has spent more than $500,000 on television alone, it wasn't until this past week that he mentioned Donald J. Trump for the first time in an ad. Like I said: He’s desperate because I’m winning.
4. In regards to the attacks and claims I would favor putting microchips into people's bodies, it is a shame that anyone would make that allegation. It's false, ugly, and making such comments is why good people do not run for office. And, to be clear I am absolutely opposed to this and the bill I voted for prohibits it.
5. I am proud of my record on the second amendment: I voted for Constitutional Carry, for a bill to reduce the crime of carrying on an expired CPL from a felony to a civil infraction, for a bill to allow the carrying of an uncased weapon on private property, and other measures to ensure our Second Amendment rights, and I earned the endorsement of the Chair of Military, Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security and of the chairs of the House and Senate Sportsmen’s caucuses.
6. In his new ad this week, Pete Meijer is saying I campaigned for Hilary Clinton--another outrageous lie that’s an act of desperation. I have been a vocal opponent of Clinton. I never did one thing to support or promote her. She represents the worst of American politics in my mind. And Meijer now seems to be taking a page or two from her ugly playbook. Shame on him.
7. Pete Meijer, through a PAC tied to him, said that the company I worked for laid off thousands of employees in Michigan and that I got millions in stock options. Neither is true. If he had asked Ambassador Secchia, one of his earliest supporters who was CEO and Chairman of the very company Meijer criticized, he would have learned that. But he’ll even bash the company of a supporter.
8. I believe in term limits at the federal level. Three terms--that's all. Peter said he’d consider term limits of 20 years. That’s a CAREER!
Pete Meijer is desperate. He has said one thing and done another throughout this campaign. He has shown that he will do and say anything to try to win. That tells me he’d do the same if he were to get in office. In fact, Pete Meijer could well be Justin Amash 2.0: A wealthy young guy with little experience who will do as he pleases once he gets to Congress, and who will reveal that he isn’t a Republican after all. And he’s young and could be there for decades!
Pete Meijer wants desperately to be part of the swamp—his endorsements come from there, like Reps. Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise. My endorsements are from the 3rd district and from Michigan: the supervisors of the townships I represent, 39 state representatives, county commissioners – people whose voices matter in Michigan, who are relevant in Michigan, and who endorsed me because they know how I operate and know that I will be a true representative of the people.
Meijer says what he needs to when he needs to say it. He does NOT care about truth. He does NOT know or represent West Michigan. Until recently, he was a registered independent in New York City. Then he moved here and decided to run as a Republican. THAT'S the ugly truth.
Shame on you, Pete Meijer.
If you want someone who will represent you and not her own self-interests and who wants to put the experience of a nearly 40-year career to work for you, share this message with your friends and ask them to get out and vote for Lynn Afendoulis on Aug. 4.

Dear Friend,
His list of crimes is long: corrupt use of his appointment power, pardons, and veto powers, corrupt disposal of public lands and interference with elections.
He repeatedly ignored Congress and claimed more power for himself under the Constitution. Despite this blatant ""usurpation of power"" as one representative put it, he had enough Senators in his pocket to acquit him when impeached.
""History repeats itself"" might sound like a cliche, but it is true. And we aren't talking about Trump, we are going further back to 1868. These were some of the many charges leveled against then President Andrew Johnson.
Johnson set our country's progress back during the critical time known as Reconstruction. But it was at precisely this time that Congress was able to pass the Tenure of Office Act,, and the 14th and 15th amendments. Like Johnson, Trump is suffering defeats at the Supreme Court too, just as Trump has done recently, on DACA, abortion restrictions and LGBTQ rights.
Important victories, to be sure, but there is so much more we need to accomplish.
That is why I am writing to you today. We KNOW Trump and Republicans are worried about losing control. NOW is the time to get to work to flip the Texas State House with five winnable seats right here in Tarrant County!
History repeats itself, until we decide to make history.
Please sign up today to write letters to unregistered Democrats, call them or donate to help pay for postage, databases, staff salaries and printing.
Help us, join us in getting as many democrats to the poll this November as possible so together, WE WILL MAKE HISTORY!

When it comes to Trump's impeachment, the American people deserve a fair and transparent trial. That's exactly what Joni Ernst voted against Tuesday night.
Senate Democrats fought until 2:00 a.m. for rules that reflected the core values of our democracy -- justice, transparency, integrity, and accountability. Values that Joni Ernst, Mitch McConnell, and their Republican colleagues chose to betray, instead helping to cover up Trump's crimes.
The American people deserve an honest review of all the facts, not this sham trial. There's still time to get it, if we all speak out.
Sign our petition and demand that Joni Ernst stop covering up Trump's crimes.
SIGN THE PETITION
Every time Democrats called for the evidence needed to hear a fair and complete impeachment trial, each Republican voted down party lines and struck down justice.
No new evidence, no new witnesses, and insufficient time to show the American people that our democracy is safe from a wannabe-king who thinks he should be above the law and who has literally gone on TV to brag about obstructing Congress (one of the articles of impeachment against him).
Joni Ernst has an obligation to the people of Iowa and across America to fight for a fair and complete trial. Instead, she remains a political hack who puts party over country.
We need to hold our elected officials accountable to our values. Demand that Joni and her Republican colleagues hold Trump accountable for his corruption and crimes.
SIGN THE PETITION
Tell Joni to do the right thing,

When someone goes to prison for a small offense -- like drug use -- that criminal record is attached to them for life. And they're often required to disclose this offense -- no matter how small -- to potential employers, landlords, banks, and others.
This is just one of many ways that our criminal justice system operates as a failed institution, stigmatizing people for the rest of their lives.
I believe we need to overhaul our criminal justice system. And if elected, I will support a movement to build a better, more rehabilitative system for Americans -- one that prevents crime and arms people with the tools needed to lead better lives. Join me by signing our petition if you agree.
ADD YOUR NAME
Here are just a few things that I would tackle as Iowa's next U.S. Senator:
* Ending for-profit prisons -- businesses should not be able to profit off the incarceration of Americans.
* Ending minimum sentencing -- each case has a unique set of circumstances surrounding it. One size does not fit all, and we must allow for differences in sentencing where appropriate.
* Stop imprisoning drug abusers -- these people are sick with addiction, a crime not deserving of a several-year prison sentence.
* Federally restoring voting rights to felons following their release.
People like Joni Ernst should be fighting for criminal justice reform day in and day out, but instead, establishment politicians continue to ignore these shortcomings.
We need leaders bold enough to fight for injustice especially when it's inconvenient.
If you agree, sign our petition and join our call for sweeping criminal justice reform. We have the ability to make lasting changes with a little help from people like you.
Thanks,
Eddie Mauro

If this month has shown us nothing else, it's that our democracy is in serious peril. It's no stretch to say that the ideals that our democracy are founded upon are quickly disappearing from the White House and the halls of the Capitol Building.
Senate Republicans failed to do their duty and crowned Trump a monarch above the law. Once he was cleared of his crimes, he fired anyone who would dare to oppose him again.
This corruption poisoning our government must be defeated. The only way to do it is by pulling off a grand slam: protect our House Majority, take down Donald Trump, and flip the Senate blue.
If we're going to flip the Senate, we need to defeat Joni Ernst. But with all of her NRA and corporate PAC money to rely on, we need your help to do it.
Alex, the fight ahead isn't easy, but it's the only one we've got. We need to hit our end-of-month goals so we can defeat Joni and help save our democracy. Can you chip in $10 or more to help out?

Once all the smoke clears from this disastrous administration and its circus of enablers, we can get to work on policy that matters.
I've got a son and a daughter, and one day, I might even have a couple of grandkids. I want them to inherit the same blue planet I did. I don't want them to worry about quality, affordable health care, and I don't want them to grow up believing that the government is a corrupt body, full of selfish people.
The best thing to ensure that future -- for my family and for yours -- is to flip the Senate and take back the White House. It's why I am running, but I can't do it alone. We can't afford to fall short this month, but we're still $7,212 short of our goals.
Can you chip in $10, or whatever you can, to help finish this month strong and flip the Senate?

This month, Joni Ernst made the ultimate case for why she doesn't deserve another six years as Iowa's senator.
FIRST: She joined over 200 other anti-choice Republicans and asked the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. It was an utter betrayal of the right to privacy and reproductive freedom.
THEN: She joined Mitch McConnell and voted to help Donald Trump cover up his crimes instead of making sure the American people have a transparent and fair impeachment trial.
NOW: We're facing our first end-of-month fundraising deadline of 2020, and we need to show that the momentum is only growing to defeat Joni Ernst and flip the Senate.
Pitch in $5 -- or whatever you can -- to help hit our January fundraising goal, defeat Joni Ernst, and flip the Senate.

Joni Ernst has traded reproductive freedom, the livelihood of Iowa farmers, the future of our democracy, access to health care, and so much more for political favors and dark money.
January is coming to a close, and we absolutely cannot afford to miss our end-of-month fundraising goals. We're just $6,982 away short, and every dollar counts in the fight to flip this seat and the entire Senate.

I have spent my career pursuing justice for the people.
Friend —
I have spent my career pursuing justice for the people.
I’ve sought justice for victims of violent crime, taken on big banks and oil companies, and prosecuted transnational criminal organizations — and I won.
Justice is on the ballot in 2020 and we have to build a grassroots team that can support all of the candidates running from coast to coast.
If you're able, will you chip in $3 to help flip the Senate? Anything you can give will help candidates running in tough races across the country.

Justice is on the ballot when the officers who killed Breonna Taylor in her own home are still walking free.
It’s on the ballot when there are two systems of justice in America: one for Trump and his cronies and one for everybody else.
And it’s on the ballot when Trump is muzzling public health officials and denying the seriousness of this pandemic that has already killed over 130,000 Americans.
We have to remember that power concedes nothing without a fight. So if we want justice, we’re going to have to fight for it. And that means building a strong grassroots team of people standing up for our common values.
So I hope you will take the time to join me today as we continue our fight for justice. You can make a donation here >>

Fellow Conservative,
I'm sure you're disgusted to witness the devastation of Democrat-run cities as crime and violence spike to record levels under the mob rule of Antifa and violent rioters.

Will you donate $25, $50 or more so that we can continue stand with President Trump and fight the far-Left socialists in this pivotal election?
So, your generous donation today will also give a critical push in this crucial final month before the election.
In case you missed my speech at the Republican National Convention, I said,
> ""[[URL REDACTED]] Republican Party is the pro-America party, and President Donald J. Trump is the pro-America candidate.""
We've been defending President Trump from the never-ending onslaught of attacks, including:

Fellow Conservative,
I'm sure you're disgusted to witness the devastation of Democrat-run cities as crime and violence spike to record levels under the mob rule of Antifa and violent rioters.
And as Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and their far-Left party cheer-on mass rioting and looting across the country, I know you agree that the soul of America is at stake in 2020.
That's why we're emailing you to make an urgent request:
Will you donate $25, $50 or more so that we can continue stand with President Trump and fight the far-Left socialists in this pivotal election?
So, your generous donation today will also give a critical push in this crucial final month before the election.
In case you missed my speech at the Republican National Convention, I said,
> ""[[URL REDACTED]] Republican Party is the pro-America party, and President Donald J. Trump is the pro-America candidate.""
We've been defending President Trump from the never-ending onslaught of attacks, including:
* An insane, fake-news fueled Russia-collusion hoax,
* Robert Mueller's taxpayer-funded ""investigation"", and
* Adam Schiff and the Dem's despicable impeachment sham!

Dear Fellow Conservative,
With Election Day just a few weeks away, my team just released our first television ad today. I hope you can take a minute to watch it here and  chip in a few bucks to help us keep it running
Our message is clear:
Conservatives stand together for law enforcement, family values, and our second amendment rights.
Democrats’ stand with rioters, looters, and ANTIFA members who want to destroy our nation’s cities and monuments. Democrats solution to the crime and chaos in our cities is to defund the police, ease our border control, and decrease funding for our military.
This is not what we stand for. We stand together, united, for our great nation’s principles, values, and institutions.
Take a moment to chip in today and show us that you stand together with us as we take on the radical left and continue to work toward victory in November.
Thank you for your support as we push toward VICTORY in November.
For freedom,
Jim Jordan

While the media is more than happy to excuse and forget Democratic blunders and failures, I haven’t forgotten.
Fellow Conservative,
This election is about your future, and it’s critical to paint a full picture of the records of Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
While the media is more than happy to excuse and forget Democratic blunders and failures, I haven’t forgotten.
* It was Joe Biden who said that if a black man didn’t vote for him, he wasn’t truly black.
* It was Joe Biden who said that black people are a monolithic community.
* It was Joe Biden who said, in all earnestness, that poor kids are just as smart as white kids.
And while his words are one thing, Joe Biden’s actions take it to a whole new level. It’s not surprising that his policies have hurt Americans of all colors and creeds.
In 1994, Biden led the charge on a crime bill that put millions of Black Americans behind bars. While this terrible policy was making things worse, two decades later President Trump’s criminal justice reform law fixed many disparities created by the 1994 crime bill.
Joe Biden has worked in Washington for 47 years, but he ignored our nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities all this time. In contrast, President Trump signed into law historically high funding for HBCUs, as well as a bill to give them permanent funding for the first time ever.
Fellow Conservative, will you stand with me to support the Republican ticket this November?
I take issue with the idea that African Americans should automatically vote for the Democrats every four years. You see, Democrats pay lip service to the Black community but have failed to deliver.
I am a proud Republican because we are the party dedicated to helping every American.
This election, I ask that you judge the candidates not by what they have said, but by what they have done.
Will you chip in to help Republicans continue their work for the American people?

69,"BREAKING: The GOP-controlled Senate just voted to acquit President Trump of all charges in the impeachment trial without hearing from ANY witnesses.
It’s all up to us – it’s clear now that the only way we are able to hold Trump accountable is through the House. So we must protect our Democratic majority this November →
HELP PROTECT DEMOCRATS
* * *
This was a sham.
Despite the overwhelming evidence, the Senate has voted to acquit Donald Trump of any crimes – without hearing from a single witness.
We need to send a strong message to Mitch McConnell and his cronies that the Democratic House will not stop fighting for justice and that we will continue to hold Trump accountable, despite their inaction.
That’s why I’m asking for 500 of my best supporters to step up in the next 24 hours to help us build a movement to protect the Democratic House in November. Can you help out?

70,"Cynical Democrats have been waiting three years for this day. Chip in any amount to help me fight with President Trump.
Rik Mehta
Alex Brown,
Today is the day.
Democrats have been promising to impeach President Trump since before he was even inaugurated. Now, their cynical plan to forcibly remove the president from office faces a House vote, with the outcome already determined.
Send me to Washington to fight with Trump
That will send this ridiculous charade to the Senate, where my opponent Cory Booker has already made his bias clear.
Booker is hell bent on impeaching President Trump because Booker says he has done “things that are unacceptable.”
This is an absolute joke. Democrats have no real crime to point to, so they rely on only their own hatred of our president to continue driving this absurd process forward.
If you are sick and tired of this sham impeachment process, please donate $100 amount to help me stand with President Trump and defeat Cory Booker in 2020.
HOUSE VOTES TODAY TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT TRUMP
Cynical Democrats have been waiting three years for this day. Chip in any amount to help me fight with President Trump.
Donate to say NO to impeachment
Thank you,

71,"Didn't want it to be a way of life.
Alex,
Of all the words Nancy Pelosi has lately spoken on the subject of impeachment, the most telling may have come in a relatively little noted CNN Town Hall on December 5. They didn’t even concern Donald Trump, but they probably said more about official Washington’s splendid isolation from the real world effect of its actions – or inactions – than all of the recent press releases on the topic combined. Responding to an audience member's question as to why she had “resisted calls for the impeachment of President Bush in 2006,"" Pelosi replied that she believed that starting the Iraq War was “not a ground for impeachment,” even as she asserted that she knew the Bush Administration’s rationale for the war to be fraudulent from the start.
Let’s remember that this was a war that Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations, had declared “illegal;"" a war whose continuing effects can be found in today’s news; a war the prospect of which provoked a level of worldwide opposition without precedent. And indeed, Pelosi reminded the audience that she herself opposed it and that the reason she knew the Administration’s arguments to be bogus was that she had served on the Intelligence Committee where they presented the evidence that would supposedly justify the war. “So, I knew there were no nuclear weapons in Iraq,” she said, “It just wasn't there ... I knew it was a misrepresentation to the public.”
And how does this all add up to “not a ground for impeachment? According to Pelosi, it’s because “they won the election. They made a representation. And to this day, people think that it was the right thing to do.” In other words, in her view, the obligation of the House to pursue the truth ended when George W. Bush lied to the public in convincing enough fashion to be reelected in 2004. Her final words on the subject at the Town Hall were that Bill Clinton had at that point recently been impeached for “being stupid,” and “Now, they want me to do George. This - I just didn't want it to be a way of life in our country.”
Could there be any clearer exposition of just how little weight international law carries in Washington, or how desensitized our leaders have become to waging foreign wars, or just how little the lives of faceless foreigners count for in the capital? A president is given a pass on impeachment for starting an illegal, unprovoked war that kills perhaps 200,000 people (estimates vary widely) – 100,000 of them civilians, and 5,000 of them American troops and mercenaries -- because the Speaker of the House doesn’t “want it to be a way of life in our country?”
When the United States ratified the United Nations Charter, we – like all other member nations – agreed to abide by certain principles, including that “All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” (Which of course means that the war would have been illegal even if the Bush Administration hadn’t been lying about the “weapons of mass destruction.”)
The judgement of the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal that tried Nazi Germany’s leaders following World War II was even clearer: “To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole."" There was a time when the Nuremberg Judgement was taken seriously in this country and even entire nations were now understood not to stand above international law. “I was just following orders” was no longer considered justification for one’s actions when the orders themselves were criminal.
Or, at the least, lip service was paid to those principles. In today’s Washington, however, raising these issues would probably just bring you a blank stare. After all, we wouldn’t want paying serious attention to such considerations to become “a way of life in our country,” would we?

72,"I sat in the lunchroom at school watching other kids eat, while I had nothing. Drugs took away my childhood, a time when I should have been carefree and cared for.
[[EMAIL_REDACTED]],
Life in Los Angeles
Both of my parents were born in McComb, Mississippi – a small town in the Southwest part of the state. My father had 12 siblings and was the 7th son, the 11th one, born on the 13th. He was a son of the South, a carpenter and a wanna-be music promoter. He held an annual Southwest Mississippi Blues and Heritage Festival every year on the 30-acre farm his parents purchased in the 1940s.
My mom was 19 with 2 kids when she decided the racism and stagnation was too much, so she opted to leave Mississippi with my sister and I to Los Angeles. In the beginning, life was good. She worked at a donut shop and could earn enough to support us. But as time went on, her lack of skills made it harder and harder to find work that would enable her to earn enough to make ends meet. She was met with disappointment and despair and finally turned to drugs to escape the realities of her life - caring for us became secondary.
I recall sitting on the balcony of our apartment building when I was 9 years old, staring down the street, waiting for my mom to come home. She showed up days later, having left us without food or nurture. I became parentified, believing it was my job to care for my younger brother and sister. We scrounged for glass bottles to redeem for coins to buy junk food at the corner market. I sat in the lunchroom at school watching other kids eat, while I had nothing. Drugs took away my childhood, a time when I should have been carefree and cared for.
Today, all over America, families like mine are torn apart by the devastating effects of drug abuse. Thousands of our children, our parents, brothers and sisters have overdosed, committed crimes or died as a consequence of drug abuse. The War on Drugs in the 1980s and 90s did not focus on addiction treatment, but rather on prosecuting and incarcerating the illness. As a result, 2.3 million Americans are locked up in jails and prisons without treatment for addiction or mental illness.
As a Congresswoman, I will fight to change the criminal justice system to make it “just”; to increase funding for treatment of drug addiction and mental illness, rather than filling our prisons with people who need help, not soul-crushing incarceration.

73,"The First Amendment and a free press are fundamental to our democracy.
Aloha Alex—
Tulsi is in U.S. Army Reserves Civil Affairs training this month with Congress being in recess. While she’s out, we want to continue to bring awareness to the vital issues she’s been working on.
In 1971, Daniel Ellsberg leaked the Pentagon Papers, exposing lies and war crimes committed by the U.S. Government intended to escalate the war in Vietnam. He became the first person charged as a source for violating the Espionage Act.
In 2010, Julian Assange and WikiLeaks released cables and documents showing war crimes against civilians in the Middle East.
And in 2013, Edward Snowden leaked thousands of documents, opening the nation’s eyes to the illegal and unconstitutional mass surveillance of Americans by security agencies.
All three of these brave whistleblowers took great personal risk to hold those in power accountable for their actions. Yet, all three have been prosecuted under the Espionage Act — a law written in 1917 that prevents those accused under it from having a fair day in court.
Watch Tulsi's video on Facebook
WATCH NOW
But as we have clearly seen time and time again, the First Amendment and a free press are fundamental to forming a more perfect union. This freedom must be fiercely protected, not undermined.
This is why Tulsi introduced H.R. 8452, the Protect Brave Whistleblowers Act, which would allow whistleblowers like Daniel Ellsberg, Julian Assange, and Edward Snowden to have a fair day in court by allowing them to defend their actions and state their motivations in a legal defense. She also called for the charges against Edward Snowden and Julian Assange to be dropped immediately with bipartisan House Resolutions 1162 and 1175.
Daniel Ellsberg Quote
Let’s stand with Tulsi and urge Congress to stand up for the American people, stand up for our freedoms, give these brave Whistleblowers a fair day in court, and pass this critical legislation now.
Stand with Tulsi

I was very disappointed today to learn that Ben McAdams will be voting to impeach President Donald Trump. As many of you know, I have supported President Trump on several key issues and I have disagreed with other decisions he has made. But the choice to impeach any president is much bigger than the person who currently holds the office. We must think about the future implications of how all future presidents will be treated. We must protect the highest office in the land from a highly politicized process. Let me tell you why I do not support the impeachment of our commander in chief.
* This is the fastest impeachment proceeding in our nation’s history. The Democrats could be taking the necessary time to find out the truth first hand but they have admittedly rushed the process to affect the upcoming election. According to their own statements they are impeaching the President to affect the election, not to get to the truth.
* The Democrats have failed to produce a crime. This is important because our founding document specifically states that a high crime or misdemeanor is required to impeach a president. This requirement is not a suggestion. The Democrats want you to believe that President Trump has committed a crime by not allowing witnesses to testify and by refusing to hand over documents. This too is a mis-characterization of the facts. As was stated by Professor Jonathon Turley from George Washington University, a President has the right to appeal to the Supreme Court when given a subpoena from Congress. This is the right of the President and it cannot be seen as a violation of the law. If so it would render the third branch of government irrelevant.
Please join me in supporting President Trump against dishonest Democrat attacks by donating to our campaigns. Half of each donation will go directly to President Trump's re-election campaign.

Jon doesn't have corporate PACs and federal lobbyists lining his campaign coffers like his opponent, David Perdue. We're relying on small-dollar, grassroots donations to power this campaign to victory.

The GOP is trying to make it more difficult for citizens to vote all across America -- and nowhere more than in Georgia. They've led efforts to purge hundreds of thousands of Georgians from voter rolls over the last few years.
They want you to wait in long lines. They want your polling place to be far away. They want you to be so dispirited and inconvenienced, you don't bother voting.
But friend, in spite of this historic voter suppression, something special is happening in Georgia.
Over 1.3 million Georgia voters have requested mail ballots -- nearly a quarter of whom didn't vote four years ago. Tens of thousands of Georgians have already voted. Just days ago, a state court rejected a GOP effort to purge 14,000 voters from voter rolls in Fulton County.

David Perdue ""among Senators whose stock trading during Coronavirus raises questions""

Like all Senators, my opponent Senator David Perdue got a classified briefing on the grave threat posed by Coronavirus.

I’ve made my career fighting and exposing exactly this kind of corrupt self-dealing.

He sold his stock in casinos -- right before the tourism industry plummeted.

Friend,
Voter suppression should be a crime.
As we speak, Georgia's election authorities are taking steps to make it harder for all eligible citizens to vote.
Here's the deal, friend: I am neck and neck in the polls with GOP Senator David Perdue, and this race is becoming the most competitive in the country.
With a race this tight, voter suppression could be the difference between whether I win and go to Washington to fight for you \-- or whether David Perdue gets another six years.
My campaign is focused on expanding the right to vote and fighting voter suppression, but I need your help to do it.
Congressman John Lewis and I launched my Senate campaign together with a Voter Registration Rally. And when I arrive in Washington, I will honor his memory by championing passage of a new Voting Rights Act so every citizen's sacred right to vote is protected.
Today, can you contribute $20 to our Voter Protection Fund? With 12 weeks to go until Election Day, we're hard at work mobilizing and protecting voters so that every eligible Georgian can vote, and vote safely.

Friend, nowhere is the fight against voter suppression more important than in my state of Georgia.
What happened during our June Primary -- with understaffed, overcrowded polling places with hours-long waits -- was an affront to the principles of our Constitution.
Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger administered an election that disproportionately disenfranchised Black and working-class voters.
And just last week, Raffensperger tried to convince DeKalb County not to send absentee ballot requests to all voters.
We cannot permit cynical politicians to abuse their power and disenfranchise American citizens.
They don't want us to be able to vote by mail. They want us to have to wait in long lines to exercise our right to vote. They want to discourage us. They want us to give up.
We won't give up. We are fighting back.
We're going to defy their voter suppression, win this election, and pass a new Voting Rights Act that will make voter suppression a federal crime.
Please, chip in $20 to our Voter Protection Fund. Friend, with just 12 weeks to go, we can't afford to wait.
Chip in $20 immediately >>
The struggle continues.
With love,
Jon

Medical teams across America are preparing for long hours and dangerous work.
Trump’s response has been a historic scandal of denial and delay. His incompetence has ensured the death toll will be higher, and it’s put medical teams at greater risk.
And here’s what really makes my blood boil:
After getting classified briefings on Coronavirus, my GOP opponent not only did nothing to sound the alarm -- HE SOLD CASINO STOCK AND BOUGHT PHARMACEUTICAL SHARES WHILE DOWNPLAYING THE RISK IN PUBLIC.

Subject: My opponent tried to profit off Coronavirus
Wow, I just got some shocking news:
David Perdue ""among Senators whose stock trading during Coronavirus raises questions""
\- Atlanta Journal Constitution
Like all Senators, my opponent Senator David Perdue got a classified briefing on the grave threat posed by Coronavirus.
But instead of warning the public or pressuring Trump to speed up his response, he bought and sold up to $425,000 in casino and pharmaceutical stocks to PROFIT off the crisis!
I’ve made my career fighting and exposing exactly this kind of corrupt self-dealing.
Perdue betrayed his oath to Georgians by profiteering on an impending pandemic while downplaying the threat in public. If that’s not a crime, it should be.

David Perdue has always been the caricature of Washington corruption. But this is even worse than I could’ve imagined.
Right now, millions of Americans are being forced to stay home and miss work. Medical teams are preparing for a wave of viral pneumonia patients. David Perdue tried to line his own pockets.
He sold his stock in casinos -- right before the tourism industry plummeted.
And he bought up stock in a mega pharmaceutical company right as Congress prepared to pass billions for emergency drug research!
We have to beat him.

Corruption is ruining our democracy.
Breaking: Cook Political Report Shifts Georgia Senate Race Toward Democrats
Corrupt politicians and their corporate donors use the federal government to enrich themselves — while obstructing popular policies like a New Civil Rights Act, affordable health care for every American, and ambitious investments in infrastructure and clean energy!
It's time for a new generation of leadership to clean up this mess.
That's why Democrat Jon Ossoff is running for U.S. Senate to launch an all-out attack on political corruption.
And Jon's opponent, GOP Senator David Perdue, is as crooked as they come:
* He got caught selling meetings for corporate campaign cash and taking illegal corporate campaign contributions.
* He bought stock in a company that produces medical PPE the same day the Senate received a classified briefing on COVID-19, then dumped casino shares to buy vaccine stock while the pandemic bore down on America.
* He took campaign cash from the pharmaceutical industry and then voted against importing cheaper prescription drugs from Canada.
* He traded his stocks 300% more than usual while writing the largest emergency spending bill in American history!
And in the most recent polling Jon Ossoff is beating crooked Perdue by 2%!!
Over the past few months, the people of Georgia have seen Senator Perdue for what he is — a mindless Trump sycophant with no beliefs of his own, a corporate sellout, and a self-dealing influence peddler — the poster boy of Washington corruption.
Jon Ossoff has spent his career exposing corruption and the abuse of power — holding people like David Perdue accountable.
REMEMBER: Jon Ossoff runs a business renowned for its hard-hitting investigations of corruption, organized crime, and war crimes around the world!
Now Jon is running for the U.S. Senate to expose and defeat one of the most corrupt Senators in American history, and he's already leading in the polls.
This is the beginning of a new chapter in our country's history and the beginning of the end for corrupt politicians like David Perdue.
Express Donate $5
Defeating a corrupt Senator like David Perdue and his political machine will require a huge grassroots campaign.
And we're going to need help building it!!
So if you're able please chip in what you can right now so we can build a movement to defeat David Perdue and win back the Senate from his crony Mitch McConnell.

Friend -- Fighting corruption is Jon Ossoff's job.
Jon runs a business that investigates bribery, organized crime, and war crimes for news organizations worldwide. They've exposed corrupt officials, corporate abuses, contract killers, ISIS war crimes, and human traffickers.

I lead a team of investigative journalists who have taken on ISIS war criminals, powerful corporations, human traffickers, and death squads. My colleagues often go undercover to expose crime and corruption around the world.
But you don’t need to go undercover to get a glimpse of the corruption in Washington. You just need to turn on the TV or visit the FEC website to see who, like my opponent David Perdue, is taking money from powerful industry groups and huge corporations. Then you can look at their voting records to see what that money bought!
* When the federal government silences its own environmental scientists because climate science threatens the powerful fossil fuel industry — that's corruption.
* When the deck is stacked against working families while Wall Street banks, wealthy donors, and powerful trade groups receive lavish subsidies — that’s corruption.
* When Congress won’t crack down on price gouging by drug companies, and guts protections for pre-existing conditions, because they're bought by insurance and pharmaceutical industries — that's corruption.
* When dark money from secret donors and powerful industries floods our airwaves with vicious propaganda — that's corruption.
I believe we are all called to fight the abuse of power, even when the odds are against us. That’s why I’m running for Senate. But I can’t do it alone. I’m relying on donations from people like you, not from corporate PACs. So I’m humbly asking you to donate anything you can before midnight.

My opponent, David Perdue is as corrupt and out-of-touch as politicians come. Perdue is the caricature of Washington corruption.
This is a man who actually lives on a private island. He made a fortune as a CEO who bragged about shipping jobs overseas before his family’s political machine launched him to high office.
Since he was elected to the Senate, Perdue hasn’t once come down from that private island to answer for his votes or unethical conduct at a public town hall.
Perdue has taken more than a MILLION dollars from shady corporate PACs.
In fact, my opponent has taken so much money from corporate PACs that the Federal Election Commission said he violated federal law!
David Perdue serves only the president and his donors — not the people he represents.
We must defeat him in November.
David Perdue is vulnerable. Experts say he’s one of the most vulnerable Republicans in the entire Senate.
But he has a MASSIVE campaign warchest (full of all that corporate PAC money), and President Trump is repaying his loyalty with huge pay-for-access fundraisers. If we’re going to beat Perdue -- and help Democrats win back the Senate -- we can’t afford to miss a single deadline.

Sen. Perdue \(The COVID-19 stocks guy\) bragged about destroying American jobs for decades
Friend,
Jon Ossoff is running against a man who bragged about spending his ""entire career"" outsourcing American jobs, and said he was ""proud of it.""
GOP Sen. David Perdue bragged *under oath* that he made his fortune as a Fortune 500 executive shipping American jobs overseas, and that he was ""proud"" of it.
These days Sen. Perdue slaps on a red MAGA hat and pretends to stand up for American workers.
But Perdue is a phony and a hypocrite.
Perdue made his fortune outsourcing American jobs, exploiting corrupt trade deals and shipping jobs to Asia -- all to serve his shareholders on Wall Street.
But, this is classic David Perdue. Just look at his crooked conduct this year:
1. He bought stock in a company that produces medical PPE the same day the Senate received a classified briefing on COVID-19.
2. He traded his stocks 300% more than usual while writing the largest emergency spending bill in American history.
3. AND he was caught selling quarterly meetings to corporate PACs for $7,500 campaign checks.
Perdue's D.C. consultants will try to spin this -- but the people will see the plain truth:
David Perdue is THE poster boy of Washington corruption.
But Democrat Jon Ossoff is leading Perdue in the polls. Help Jon win >>
RUSH $5 TO GEORGIA NOW >>
Democrat Jon Ossoff runs a business that exposes corruption, organized crime, and war crimes.
Jon has dedicated his life to holding guys like David Perdue accountable.
And he can DEFEAT Perdue (the latest poll has Jon ahead by TWO POINTS!)
But Donald Trump Jr. is raising big money for Perdue now, and we need your grassroots support to stay competitive.
If you're able, can you chip in $5, $10, or whatever is possible right now?
We've set a huge end of the month fundraising goal of $50,000, and we need your help getting there.

Friend,
Our nation is in crisis.
As I'm writing to you, amidst a public health emergency, President Trump is deploying unidentified federal troops to patrol our cities and snatch American citizens into unmarked vans on our streets.
We *must* win the White House and secure a majority in the U.S. Senate.
That's why today I'm urging you to join me in supporting my friend Jon Ossoff for U.S. Senate in Georgia.
Jon is an investigative journalist and media executive whose company has exposed bribery, human traffickers, war crimes, and corporate abuses.
I've gotten to know Jon over the last few years, and his passion for exposing corruption and the abuse of power is EXACTLY what's called for in the Senate today.
I want Jon Ossoff to fight alongside me in the U.S. Senate. So I'm asking you to help:
Send $5 so Jon Ossoff can WIN in Georgia
Since winning the Democratic nomination in a landslide, Jon has earned the endorsement of organizations like NARAL Pro-Choice America, Planned Parenthood, and the Human Rights Campaign.
Friend, they all know what I know: Jon Ossoff is a champion of the people who will stand up to corruption and the abuse of power.
Trump and Mitch McConnell know Jon is a threat. Republican super PACs have already committed more than $21 million to try to stop him. We need to show our grassroots power and equip Jon to hit back twice as hard.

Friend, it's long past time to end Mitch McConnell's reign in the Senate.
If Democrats win the Senate majority, we won't have to worry about another two years of extreme right-wing judges and disgraceful attempts to rip health care away from millions of Americans.
Instead, we will be able to make real progress on the issues that are important to us: making prescription drugs affordable, taking meaningful steps to combat the climate crisis, addressing police brutality, keeping our children safe from gun violence, and securing equal justice for all.
Georgia is a key battleground state and Jon is running to win one of the most flippable seats in the Senate. For Democrats to win a Senate majority, we have to win this seat.
And Jon has what it takes to win.
But only with your help, friend.
If you want to flip the Senate and end Mitch McConnell's majority, will you chip in $5 right now to elect Jon Ossoff in Georgia?

The decision to terminate a pregnancy is a deeply personal one. It belongs to individual women, who know themselves and their own health -- not to politicians who would impose their personal views.
I run a business that investigates organized crime and corruption for news organizations worldwide, and we have investigated and exposed how dangerous, unqualified, and unregulated abortion providers kill thousands of women in places where safe abortion services are not available legally.
I will fight with every bone in my body to protect the privacy of women's health care in America, friend.
This is not about partisan politics -- it's about health, human rights, and privacy from government intrusion.
As Senator, I will only vote to confirm federal judges who pledge to uphold Roe v. Wade.
But I am running against a limitlessly-funded extremist who is so arrogant, he believes he is entitled to make these decisions for women in Georgia. If he is elected to another six-year term in the Senate, he will vote to confirm dozens of federal judges who will seize and destroy women's right to privacy in health care and to safe, legal abortion. Please help me win this race so I can fight to defend Roe v. Wade in the United States Senate.

I lead a team of investigative journalists who have taken on ISIS war criminals, powerful corporations, human traffickers, and death squads. My colleagues often go undercover to expose crime and corruption around the world.
But you don’t need to go undercover to get a glimpse of the corruption in Washington. You just need to turn on the TV or visit the FEC website to see who, like my opponent David Perdue, is taking money from powerful industry groups and huge corporations. Then you can look at their voting records to see what that money bought!
* When the federal government silences its own environmental scientists because climate science threatens the powerful fossil fuel industry — that's corruption.
* When the deck is stacked against working families while Wall Street banks, wealthy donors, and powerful trade groups receive lavish subsidies — that’s corruption.
* When Congress won’t crack down on price gouging by drug companies, and guts protections for pre-existing conditions, because they're bought by insurance and pharmaceutical industries — that's corruption.
* When dark money from secret donors and powerful industries floods our airwaves with vicious propaganda — that's corruption.
I believe we are all called to fight the abuse of power, even when the odds are against us. That’s why I’m running for Senate. But I can’t do it alone. I’m relying on donations from people like you, not from corporate PACs. So I’m humbly asking you to donate anything you can before midnight.

My opponent, David Perdue is as corrupt and out-of-touch as politicians come. Perdue is the caricature of Washington corruption.
This is a man who actually lives on a private island. He made a fortune as a CEO who bragged about shipping jobs overseas before his family’s political machine launched him to high office.
Since he was elected to the Senate, Perdue hasn’t once come down from that private island to answer for his votes or unethical conduct at a public town hall.
Perdue has taken more than a MILLION dollars from shady corporate PACs.
In fact, my opponent has taken so much money from corporate PACs that the Federal Election Commission said he violated federal law!
David Perdue serves only the president and his donors — not the people he represents.
We must defeat him in November.
David Perdue is vulnerable. Experts say he’s one of the most vulnerable Republicans in the entire Senate.
But he has a MASSIVE campaign warchest (full of all that corporate PAC money), and President Trump is repaying his loyalty with huge pay-for-access fundraisers. If we’re going to beat Perdue -- and help Democrats win back the Senate -- we can’t afford to miss a single deadline.
There are just 12 hours until our next deadline, so time is running out. Humbly, can you make a donation now to help me defeat Trump’s favorite Senator?

Friend,
Did you get a chance to read Stacey Abrams' note from last week?
Stacey is right: Georgia is 2020's TOP BATTLEGROUND STATE.
Victory in Georgia delivers 16 Electoral College votes and TWO U.S. Senate seats.
That's right -- TWO Senate seats in ONE state in ONE Election Year.
But overcoming voter suppression and winning in Georgia requires a real grassroots juggernaut -- a ground-up movement with strong voter protection and digital organizing.
Friend -- we need your support to make these crucial investments in Georgia immediately.
So please, chip in ANY amount NOW before our critical FEC fundraising deadline tomorrow. >>

Friend,
We just had our primary elections in Georgia.
Even in the face of incompetence and voter suppression on the part of Georgia's Secretary of State, Georgia Democrats SHATTERED turnout records. We nominated a man I am proud to endorse for the U.S. Senate: my friend Jon Ossoff.
AND GET THIS: For the first time since 2008, Georgia's Democratic Primary voters exceeded Republican primary voters. We are building huge momentum here, friend!
That's why I'm asking you to chip in $5 right now to support Jon Ossoff's Democratic campaign for U.S. Senate in Georgia.
Contribute to Jon Ossoff's campaign for U.S. Senate >>
You all know my friend Jon Ossoff as the inspiring young Democrat who broke turnout and grassroots fundraising records in the historic Special Election for Georgia's Sixth District three years ago.
Jon came up just a few thousand votes short in the most expensive Congressional race of all time -- and amidst suspicious destruction of election data -- after running a historic campaign that built a huge progressive infrastructure in Georgia.
You may not know that Jon is also a former Congressional national security aide who now works as a media executive and investigative journalist, and that Jon does amazing work exposing corruption, war crimes, and human rights abuses worldwide.
Jon leads a business that investigates powerful corporations, human traffickers, and other bad actors for major news organizations.
And when he worked in Washington, Jon made a name for himself on Capitol Hill by helping investigate mass surveillance of American citizens and malfeasance by federal contractors.
Friend, when it comes to fighting corruption, Jon Ossoff does not back down.
When I ran for Governor in 2018, Georgia voters saw corruption and the abuse of power up close -- a voting system that failed by design and disenfranchised countless Georgia voters.
Last week, we saw the same voting system fail us again, so we must work harder than ever to mobilize and protect voters so that Jon can win.
Friend, Jon Ossoff is currently leading his Republican opponent in the polls. But for Jon to win, we have to double down on our efforts to defend voting rights and ensure every vote is counted in Georgia.
So I'm asking you now: to defend our values, to deliver TWO U.S. Senate victories in Georgia and win the White House, to send a message that will echo through history, please join me in chipping into Jon's campaign TODAY:

Friend,
Our nation is in crisis.
As I'm writing to you, amidst a public health emergency, President Trump is deploying unidentified federal troops to patrol our cities and snatch American citizens into unmarked vans on our streets.
We *must* win the White House and secure a majority in the U.S. Senate.
That's why today I'm urging you to join me in supporting my friend Jon Ossoff for U.S. Senate in Georgia.
Jon is an investigative journalist and media executive whose company has exposed bribery, human traffickers, war crimes, and corporate abuses.
I've gotten to know Jon over the last few years, and his passion for exposing corruption and the abuse of power is EXACTLY what's called for in the Senate today.
I want Jon Ossoff to fight alongside me in the U.S. Senate. So I'm asking you to help:
Send $5 so Jon Ossoff can WIN in Georgia
Since winning the Democratic nomination in a landslide, Jon has earned the endorsement of organizations like NARAL Pro-Choice America, Planned Parenthood, and the Human Rights Campaign.
Friend, they all know what I know: Jon Ossoff is a champion of the people who will stand up to corruption and the abuse of power.
Trump and Mitch McConnell know Jon is a threat. Republican super PACs have already committed more than $21 million to try to stop him. We need to show our grassroots power and equip Jon to hit back twice as hard.
Can you chip in $5 to elect Jon Ossoff and flip Georgia blue?

Friend, it's long past time to end Mitch McConnell's reign in the Senate.
If Democrats win the Senate majority, we won't have to worry about another two years of extreme right-wing judges and disgraceful attempts to rip health care away from millions of Americans.
Instead, we will be able to make real progress on the issues that are important to us: making prescription drugs affordable, taking meaningful steps to combat the climate crisis, addressing police brutality, keeping our children safe from gun violence, and securing equal justice for all.
Georgia is a key battleground state and Jon is running to win one of the most flippable seats in the Senate. For Democrats to win a Senate majority, we have to win this seat.
And Jon has what it takes to win.
But only with your help, friend.
If you want to flip the Senate and end Mitch McConnell's majority, will you chip in $5 right now to elect Jon Ossoff in Georgia?

Thank you for stepping up,

Friend,
On November 3, we are going to close the door on Donald Trump's presidency. Then, we can expand our potential to make real progress on the issues that make a difference in people's lives.
But to achieve that potential, we need my friend Jon Ossoff in the United States Senate. Here's why:
It's time to elect a new generation of leaders. And Jon Ossoff's achievements as an investigative journalist -- leading a team that's exposed war crimes, enslavement, murder, and bribery all over the planet -- speak to his courage, his values, and his toughness.
Jon and his supporters have made this one of the country's most competitive races during a time when dozens of states are coming into play. So today I'm asking you to dig deep and invest in Jon's victory. Will you donate right now to help Jon Ossoff win in Georgia and flip the Senate?

Senate Republicans have used the past four years to give tax breaks to the wealthy, scheme how to take health care away from millions, and confirm scores of unqualified or extreme judicial and executive nominees.
The solution to removing the GOP stranglehold on the Senate lies in no small part with Jon Ossoff in Georgia. Jon is surging in the polls as more and more voters learn about his history fighting corruption.
But here's what's even more important: Jon is someone Georgians can rely on. He is focused on ensuring every American has affordable health care and rebuilding the economy so working families and small businesses thrive, and he's committed to passing a new Voting Rights Act and a new Civil Rights Act.
When I look at Georgia, I see what Virginia looked like just a few years ago. Democrats are making huge inroads, and if we can all do our part to invest and help good, smart leaders like Jon reach the finish line, we can flip Georgia.
Jon is neck-and-neck in the polls with his pro-Trump opponent who has repeatedly voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But the GOP knows control of the Senate comes down to Georgia, so they are spending big to keep their power. Mitch McConnell's allies and super PACs have already committed over $25 million to stop Jon.
Jon isn't taking contributions from corporate PACs or federal lobbyists. That means he's relying on a small-dollar grassroots campaign to power him to victory.
We can't flip the Senate without you, friend. Can you chip in $15 to elect Jon Ossoff in Georgia and help chart a new course for this country?

It's pretty simple: David Perdue will vote with his donors in the insurance industry to end health care protections for Georgians who are fighting for their lives, then lie in public about it.

Subject: Jon's opponent is deceiving voters
Friend,
Sen. David Perdue is trying to deceive Georgia voters in his ads.
In his latest ad, Perdue said health insurance should cover pre-existing conditions -- even though he has voted MULTIPLE TIMES against ensuring protections for the 1.8 million Georgians with pre-existing conditions, and supports a lawsuit that could kick nearly 500,000 Georgians off their health care.
David Perdue is getting desperate -- because he knows he is going to lose.
He has to deceive his constituents, because his record is indefensible. He puts lobbyists and donors first, and his constituents last!
The people of Georgia deserve a leader like Jon Ossoff who they can trust to protect and strengthen their health care -- not someone who has to lie about his record to win votes.
Friend, can you make a donation to power Jon to victory and send a fighter for health care to the Senate?

David Perdue enables the corruption in Washington.
He has taken nearly $300,000 from health industry PACs (!!!), all while voting in their favor.
And he isn't the only one.
In 2019, the pharmaceutical and health products industry alone employed 1,471 lobbyists -- that's nearly three lobbyists per member of Congress!
Friend, corporate lobbyists have too much influence over politicians from both parties -- our elected officials should be serving the people!
This widespread corruption needs to end!
And Jon is determined to clean up Washington!
He will ban corporate political donations and secret corporate money in politics. He is the anti-corruption crusader that Georgians and Americans need.
Friend, can you pitch in $20 to send Jon to Washington and elect a leader who will put the people first and ensure everyone's access to affordable health care?
DONATE $20 >>

These are trying times.
But I learned from my mentor, Congressman John Lewis, that when we band together we can push the wheel of history toward progress.
And I learned in 2017, when I ran for Congress, that we can build a grassroots army to rival the power of the corrupt machine.
I believe we are all called to stand up to the abuse of power.
Real talk — here’s what at stake:
Corruption threatens our republic.
* When 9 out of 10 Americans support universal background checks but Congress refuses because they're bought by the NRA — that’s corruption.
* When Congress won’t crack down on price gouging by drug companies, and guts protections for pre-existing conditions, because they're bought by insurance and pharmaceutical industries — that's corruption.
* When the federal government silences its own environmental scientists because science threatens the fossil fuel industry — that's corruption.
* When dark money from secret donors and powerful industries floods our airwaves with vicious propaganda — that's corruption.
Let’s fight back together. The time has come to launch an all-out attack on corruption in America.
I’m REFUSING corporate PAC donations. That means I’m relying on grassroots supporters like you to power us to victory. Please join me and help send me to the Senate to fight for us >>

Look, I don’t want to be bleak -- but 2020 may be our last chance…
* Our last chance to deliver health care for every American.
* Our last chance to save this planet.
* Our last chance to save our democracy.
Our government has squandered trillions on war, trillions on bailouts for failed banks, trillions on tax cuts for rich political donors.
And then we're told there’s nothing left over for the people.
Why? Because our system is rotten.
But here’s the good news. We still live in a democracy. We are citizens! We have the power to shape history.
Will you help?

Listen, I’m an investigative journalist. I lead a team that fights crime and corruption all over the world. We've taken on ISIS war criminals, powerful corporations, human traffickers, and death squads.
For that work my team has faced retribution, violence, and even death.
But I believe we are all called to fight the abuse of power, even when the odds are against us. That’s why I’m running for Senate.
Mark my words: The Senate majority will come down to Georgia. Will you help remove corrupt Mitch McConnell from power?

And then, we can get to work building the world we imagine together: Where decency, human rights, shared prosperity, and health define a world we are proud to leave to our children.
This is the fight of a lifetime. I am going to put it all on the line.

Trump Pence Make America Great Again
Alex,
It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
For the sake of American strength, jobs, law and order, our lives, and our liberties, we must defeat this radical duo on Election Day. The stakes have never been higher, Alex, and we need your help to send a message that this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS.
For the NEXT HOUR, all contributions will be 600%-MATCHED!

Electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November would be a grave mistake for this Nation with irreversible consequences. They will raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators.
We cannot allow our Nation to go down that path, Alex.

Obamagate is the biggest political crime in our Nation’s history.

It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
For the sake of American strength, jobs, law and order, our lives, and our liberties, we must defeat this radical duo on Election Day. The stakes have never been higher, Alex, and we need your help to send a message that this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS.
For the NEXT HOUR, all contributions will be 600%-MATCHED!
Please contribute ANY AMOUNT in the NEXT HOUR to FIGHT for President Trump and your gift will be 600%-MATCHED. >>

Electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November would be a grave mistake for this Nation with irreversible consequences. They will raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators.
We cannot allow our Nation to go down that path, Alex.
President Trump and I are counting on our BEST supporters right now. Can we count on YOU to step up during this critical time?
Please contribute ANY AMOUNT IMMEDIATELY to help us WIN BIG in November and your gift will be instantly 600%-MATCHED.
Thank you,

Alex,
The Election this November will go down as the most important Election in American history.
On November, 3rd, the American People will decide if we’re going to Keep America Great, or if America will become a Big Government Socialist Nation of high taxes, high crime, blatant corruption, and open borders.
It’s no secret that this fight is going to be tough. It’s going to take all hands on deck to defeat Sleepy Joe Biden, which is why President Trump needs every single Patriot to step up and fight back.
Your support will provide the necessary resources to help us WIN BIG in November and ultimately secure FOUR MORE YEARS of President Trump.

Alex,
Wow.
Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn’t get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?).

Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP.

These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it’s obvious that this radical duo is PERFECT for each other but WRONG for America.

Despite the fact that Tony Bobulinski, a former business partner of Hunter Biden, dropped a BOMBSHELL only ONE HOUR before we took the stage, the Fake News media REFUSED to question Sleepy Joe about it.
I knew they were going to do everything they could to cover up Joe Biden’s CORRUPT family dealings with China, so I’m taking matters into my own hands.
The truth is, Joe Biden is totally and completely compromised. Many witnesses say what his son, Hunter, did is a crime against our Country. This isn’t going away, no matter how much Joe ‘the Big Guy’ Biden LIES about it.

Obamagate is the biggest political crime in our Nation’s history.
Barack Obama will forever be remembered as the disgraced former President who used federal law enforcement in an attempt to hurt his political opponents.
His administration, including Sleepy Joe Biden, “illegally spied” on President Trump and his 2016 campaign and then LIED about it - we can’t let them get away with it.

These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it’s obvious that this radical duo is PERFECT for each other but WRONG for America.
They are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working tirelessly to restore LAW AND ORDER.
It’s going to be up to Patriots like YOU to save our Nation from that dark fate, Alex. Election Day is right around the corner, and now that we know what we’re up against, I’m going to do something HUGE:

Trump Pence Make America Great Again
Alex,
It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
For the sake of American strength, jobs, law and order, our lives, and our liberties, we must defeat this radical duo on Election Day. The stakes have never been higher, Alex, and we need your help to send a message that this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS.
For the NEXT HOUR, all contributions will be 600%-MATCHED!

We cannot allow our Nation to go down that path, Alex.

But the lawlessness and unchecked crime goes beyond the riots from groups like ANTIFA, and into violence and even MURDER.

120,"Today is emancipation day.
Desiree Tims for Congress
Alex,
Juneteenth is celebrated on this day to commemorate the freeing of the enslaved people of Texas, who had been legally freed two years prior by the Emancipation Proclamation.
While this day marks the true end of slavery in the United States, we know all too well the history of the past 100 years. Jim Crow, segregation, redlining, disparate sentencing, and wage disparities have crippled many Black Americans from accessing the full American dream.
As the last month has highlighted, racial equity is still a goal we’re striving to meet. We’re still fighting to be treated equally in our own country, working to raise awareness for the unique issues facing the Black community, and protesting and mourning when our brothers and sisters are murdered for the crime of being Black in America.
As we recommit ourselves to continuing down the long road in front of us, we should all take time to remember those that came before us. The enslaved men and women who knew no life beyond a plantation; the impoverished sharecroppers -- like my grandfather -- who were exploited in all-too-familiar ways in the South; leaders like Dr. King and Medgar Evers who were gunned down for imagining a country that lived up to our professed ideals of freedom and equality; and the names echoing through our streets today whose lives were taken by police brutality: We must honor their memory by continuing our fight for justice.
I’ll never forget the shoulders I stand on. And I’ll never forget the sacrifices of not just my ancestors, but of all the people who have led movements for change, justice, and equality.
This Juneteenth, can you help me become the first African American to represent Ohio’s 10th District? Here’s a secure link to donate to my campaign: [[URL REDACTED]]

Desiree Tims for Congress
Hey Alex,
This past week, the House passed the Emmett Till Anti-lynching Act with only four dissenting votes. This is a step in the right direction, but I can’t help but think how history would be different had this been passed a century ago.
Lynching was a horrific crime and the fact that it took until 2020 to pass a law making it a federal crime is unacceptable.
This is why we need more African-Americans representing us at all levels of government.
It was the hard work of African-American Senators and Representatives that made this bill a reality, and when I’m in Congress, I will join these brave legislators in their unending fight for true equity.
But today, I need your help. In order to be the first African-American to represent OH-10, I first need to hit my FINAL end-of-month goal before Election Day.

Desiree Tims for Congress
Alex,
The events of this past week are all too familiar. A Black man was murdered in broad daylight by a white police officer.
His name was George Floyd, and he died for committing the crime of being Black in America.
Since then, protests have erupted across the country. Black people, tired of seeing their brothers and sisters murdered on the streets and in their own homes, have shown they’re not going to take this oppression any longer.
This weekend, I joined one of those peaceful demonstrations. Together, we did one of the most American things possible: we gathered peacefully and had our voices heard.
I told the crowd that now is not the time to give up -- now is the time to lean in. Because while it’s easy to be depressed about the state of our country, I know we have the potential to do so much better, and that’s why I’m fighting for the people of the Miami Valley and Southwest Ohio.
We all must continue to speak up and hold our leaders accountable, protest, and vote. This problem isn’t going to go away on its own, the people need to show that we’re not going to take this oppression.
In memory of George Floyd, John Crawford, Ahmaud Arbery, Tamir Rice, Atatiana Jefferson, Breona Taylor, Sandra Bland, and all those we’ve lost on the journey to equal justice—you are remembered.
In solidarity,
Desiree Tims

* * *
Dear Alex —
In the last six months, we’ve seen, again and again, the failures of our criminal legal system. A system that disproportionately punishes and incarcerates Black Americans is a system that is fundamentally unjust.
These problems exist at the local level, in our backyard jurisdictions and county courthouses. So if we’re going to make systemic change, we must look locally. Gary Tyack understands this, which is why I’m proud to support him in his campaign for Franklin County Prosecutor. Can you split a donation today between Gary’s campaign and our Ohio Voter Fund?
Contribute > >
County prosecutors play a crucial role in determining how our legal system operates. Here are just a few parts of Gary’s platform that make him the right candidate for the job:
* Create youth programs: Instead of incarceration for low-level crimes, Gary will push for young people to be redirected towards counseling, mental healthcare, tutoring, and other proactive measures. This will mark a step towards ending the school-to-prison pipeline and the incarceration state that has trapped so many Americans.
* Decriminalize mental illness and addiction: Gary will seek to establish a community-based stabilization center in partnership with the county and existing programs, so that anyone experiencing a mental health crisis or struggling with drug addiction will receive the care they need, without unnecessary intervention from police.
* Ensure equity in prosecution: By establishing a database that would allow the prosecutor to continually monitor for charging discrepancies within communities of color, Gary would proactively work to create a justice system that is fair and equitable.
Put simply, we need people like Gary in these positions if we hope to undo a long history of injustice at every level of government.
So, if you’re able, will you contribute today? Your donation will be evenly split between Gary’s campaign and our Ohio Voter Fund.

#
Friends —
The people of Maine deserve a senator who puts them first.
They deserve a senator who fights to make our country work for everyone, not the special interests.
They deserve a senator who isn't afraid to speak truth to power.
They deserve Sara Gideon, the Democratic nominee for this November — not Republican Susan Collins.
Let's help elect Sara Gideon, unseat Susan Collins, and flip one of the key seats Democrats need to take back the Senate.
If making a donation makes sense for you right now, please chip in $3 or whatever you can to support Sara Gideon so we can win big in Maine.
So, let's talk about Susan Collins.
In 2018, when she cast one of the deciding votes to give Brett Kavanaugh a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, she said that he would uphold precedents that protect abortion rights.
How did that work out? Well, last month, he voted to overturn one of those precedents — and now, he's got Roe v. Wade in his sights.
Earlier this year, when Susan Collins voted against convicting Donald Trump in the Senate, she said that he didn't need to be held accountable because he already learned a ""pretty big lesson"" from being impeached.
Yeah, sure, he's learned his lesson — he's learned there are enough Republican enablers in the Senate who will let him do anything he wants. He's learned that lesson so well that recently, he rewarded Roger Stone with a presidential pardon for committing crimes to protect Trump.
Meanwhile, as Speaker of Maine's House of Representatives, Sara Gideon has been clear-eyed about the corruption that rewards the wealthy and well-connected, and committed to getting results for the people she serves.
Sara Gideon has helped protect health care for Mainers with pre-existing conditions, fight the opioid crisis by expanding treatment and prevention while pledging to hold giant drug companies accountable for causing this crisis, and stood up for reproductive justice.
Now, Sara Gideon is ready to keep serving Maine as a U.S. Senator. But the polls show that this race is going to be competitive, and Susan Collins is a longtime incumbent who won't be easy to beat.
We need to fight side by side as a grassroots movement to send Sara Gideon to Washington. Can you make a donation right now to support her campaign? Anything you can contribute would make a real difference in this powerfully important race.
Thanks for being a part of this,
Elizabeth

MY CANDIDATE STATEMENT
Ronald Reagan proclaimed our country as a Beacon of Light and a Shining City on a Hill, but right now we are not reaching our potential as a country.
We need leaders with solutions. We need leaders that can relate to the struggles of everyday people. Most importantly, we need leaders that value honesty and new ideas.
I understand your struggles and I am bringing new ideas, the needed experience and a fresh perspective to the table that will help restore the American dream.
As a business owner and concerned citizen, I worry for the future of Californian families. We have high taxes, increased crime, inadequate enforcement of immigration laws and growing poverty rates.
In Orange County, rents are skyrocketing, homelessness is on the rise, and regardless of party, leaders are not acting in good faith to the great people they represent.

MY CANDIDATE STATEMENT
Ronald Reagan proclaimed our country as a Beacon of Light and a Shining City on a Hill, but right now we are not reaching our potential as a country.
We need leaders with solutions. We need leaders that can relate to the struggles of everyday people. Most importantly, we need leaders that value honesty and new ideas.
I understand your struggles and I am bringing new ideas, the needed experience and a fresh perspective to the table that will help restore the American dream.
As a business owner and concerned citizen, I worry for the future of Californian families. We have high taxes, increased crime, inadequate enforcement of immigration laws and growing poverty rates.
In Orange County, rents are skyrocketing, homelessness is on the rise, and regardless of party, leaders are not acting in good faith to the great people they represent.

129,"ll of the polls have me way ahead of my opponent, Harley Rouda. I am riling up our conservative base and reaching out to the younger generation.
For Our Country. For Our Future.
Dear Alex Brown,
This is Brian Burley and I am running to be your next U.S. Representative for California’s 48th Congressional District. Voting begins this week and I wanted to reach out and make sure we can count on your vote.
Orange County has changed voting procedures for this Primary. This week, all registered voters in Orange County will receive a mail-in ballot. Voters are also able to vote at any of the 188 voting centers throughout the county starting 11 days out from March 3rd, the official election date. Please feel free to contact me directly if you need help finding a voting center, turning in your ballot or if you have any other questions. You can contact me directly at (714)824-0032 or via email at [[URL REDACTED]]
Every vote matters so please make sure to get your ballot in by March 3rd.
I am the only Republican that can beat Pelosi-Puppet Harley Rouda. The 48th Congressional District in California is also the key to taking back the U.S. House for Republicans this November and I am going to make sure we take back this district. It is a district in which Republicans hold a seven percent registration advantage. This seat is also the key to taking back Reagan Country here in Orange County. We will use a victory in this race as a building block to A New Conservative Movement here in California.
My Democratic opponent, Harley Rouda has done nothing over these past two years and this very conservative district is already telling him that enough is enough. All of the polls have me way ahead of my opponent, Harley Rouda. I am riling up our conservative base and reaching out to the younger generation as I would be our youngest Congressional leader in the country. Can you imagine having a young, strong and Pro-Constitution Republican arguing with Nancy Pelosi and AOC on the House floor? I can, and I can assure you that neither of them would stand a chance in a debate.
This election is incredibly important and my candidacy gives us the opportunity to elect a Common-Sense Conservative to Congress. I am running on specific proposals to cut taxes, crack down on illegal immigration and to balance our budget. I am ready to deliver and to work tirelessly on your behalf in our nation’s capital.
With just one month until the Primary here in California, I am asking for your vote and your support. I need your help to combat Harley Rouda’s special interest money this November.

For Our Country. For Our Future.
Dear Alex Brown,
Republicans have a crucial decision this March but I am the clear choice. I am the ONLY Republican that has a lead on Democrat Harley Rouda in the polls. Point Blank Political recently released a poll where I have a commanding lead in a November head-to-head matchup with Pelosi Puppet Harley Rouda. All of the polls also have my campaign up BIG on my primary opponents as voters are resonating with my message and my movement. I am the only Republican that WILL win in November and we need this seat to take back the House.
We have crooked career politicians on our own side of the fence and it is important we select a candidate that will truly represent us. We have to use this seat to take our party back. After we win this seat we will use this victory as a building block to rebuild the Conservative movement here in OC and CA.
I will never stop fighting on your behalf. With less than a month until the March 3rd Primary, I would greatly appreciate you supporting by campaign by donating or volunteering. Links are below to get involved.

MY CANDIDATE STATEMENT
Ronald Reagan proclaimed our country as a Beacon of Light and a Shining City on a Hill, but right now we are not reaching our potential as a country.
We need leaders with solutions. We need leaders that can relate to the struggles of everyday people. Most importantly, we need leaders that value honesty and new ideas.
I understand your struggles and I am bringing new ideas, the needed experience and a fresh perspective to the table that will help restore the American dream.
As a business owner and concerned citizen, I worry for the future of Californian families. We have high taxes, increased crime, inadequate enforcement of immigration laws and growing poverty rates.
In Orange County, rents are skyrocketing, homelessness is on the rise, and regardless of party, leaders are not acting in good faith to the great people they represent.
The last thing we need right now are more career politicians. It is time for change and I will never stop fighting on behalf of you!
I am running on a Pro-Constitution, American Family Values and Common-Sense Conservative platform. Once I am your Congressman, we will Make Orange County Great Again!
My campaign is For Our Country and For Our Future. I graciously ask for your vote in this upcoming election. I encourage you to go to my website, [[URL REDACTED]], to read my story and my platform.

139,"The January Poll among GOP and Independent voters had my campaign at 50.3 percent!
For Our Country. For Our Future.
Dear Alex Brown,
The Primary is less than three weeks away and my campaign has all the momentum. Point Blank Political released two polls this afternoon that showed I am receiving overwhelming support from both Republicans and Independents in this Primary. The January Poll among GOP and Independent voters had my campaign at 50.3 percent! Pelosi-Puppet Rouda earned 23.3 percent in the poll with Career Politician Steel receiving 6.7 percent. The sample size between both the December and January poll is 834 Likely Primary Voters.
These two polls are great news as all the hard work from my campaign, volunteers and supporters is paying off. However, the poll also found that nearly 1 in 5 voters is still undecided! With three weeks left until the primary we need to make sure we get our voters to the polls and that we also convince undecided voters to vote for my campaign!
This weekend is Volunteer Weekend for my campaign and we are calling on all our supporters to help us spread the word. We need your help and support to going door-to-door and display our signs. We are also teaming up with Trump supporters on Monday in order to spread the word throughout our community. Please let us know if you are interested in joining us at any point over these next three weeks.
We are in the homestretch. Please support our campaign below by signing up to volunteer or by contributing to my campaign. Every dollar helps and every passing of the word to your friends, family and neighbors helps as well.
Thank you and God-Bless,
Brian Burley

140,"Everything you need to know about our differences
Donate
Tomorrow is Election Day. I have only gotten this far because of people like you. As a 100% grassroots funded campaign, I can only win with your support. I am once again asking for your financial support. Please consider donating to this campaign by visiting my website.
Congresswoman Dingell is a perfectly nice person.
But she is not a Progressive.
​
We live in one of the most progressive districts in the
country—Democrats get almost 70% of the vote here.
We deserve a representative who will champion our
progressive values.
​
In this election, we have a choice.
A choice between an unapologetic progressive
and someone who is progressive in name only.
A choice between someone who has taken almost $2 million
in corporate donations, and someone who will never take
a cent of corporate money.
A choice between someone who is part of a political dynasty
that has held this seat for 87 years straight, and someone
who has been a grassroots activist for years.
​
I am the only Progressive running in MI-12.
​
But don't just take my word for it.
Scroll down to look at the differences between
the candidates on the issues.
Money in Politics
Solomon has vowed to refuse all money from corporations, including the fossil fuel and health care industries. Solomon also wants to get money out of our political system once and for all, and advocates for publicly-funded elections as well as ending the revolving door of politics.
Representative Dingell has taken almost $2 million in corporate PAC donations, from companies including Blue Cross/Blue Shield, DTE energy and other fossil fuel companies, as well as Boeing. Dingell was also a lobbyist for several years before she took office, and has personally participated in the revolving door of politics.
Higher Education
Solomon supports tuition free public college. He also supports the cancelation of student debt. Solomon believes every individual should be able to afford college, and it is vital to our economy that young people can fully participate and are not buried by student loans for their adult lives.
Representative Dingell supports student’s ability to refinance student loans, but she has not supported complete debt cancellation or tuition-free public college.
Trade & Labor
Solomon believes that free trade agreements like NAFTA and the
USMCA trade deal have incentivized corporations to ship jobs overseas, and have continued to allow human rights abuses and environmental degradation
to occur in these overseas communities. We must re-negotiate these trade deals to both benefit the laborers in
our country, as well as lower-income countries where corporations take advantage of low wage laborers.
Solomon believes that we must
rewrite these trade agreements
to include stronger environmental regulations, protections for laborers and wage increases, end incentives for outsourcing jobs, as well as end federal contracting with companies that have outsourced jobs.
Representative Dingell has voted for the USMCA trade deal, even though there is little environmental protection or improvement since the NAFTA trade deal.
Rent Relief during COVID-19
Solomon supports cancelling rent, utility, and mortgage payments for the duration of this pandemic. This disease is not going away anytime soon. More and more individuals will lose their jobs, but their rent will still be due. This can be one of the most effective ways to provide immediate relief to working people. Solomon also supports creating a fund to ensure that landlords do not lose money during this cancellation.
Rep. Dingell has not signed or co-sponsored Ilhan Omar's Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act. She has not publicly supported cancelling rent for the duration of this pandemic.
The Green New Deal
Right now, our nation is facing one of the largest periods of unemployment in recent memory. Solomon believes that, in order to get us out of this recession, we must adopt a Green New Deal. Why not transfer to a 100% renewable economy and create millions of good-paying, unionized jobs in the process? Solomon does not believe that market-based solutions that promote technological innovation will solve our climate crisis as quickly as we need it to be solved. The GND is a non-binding piece of legislation that is simply stating a goal for our future. There is no excuse for a representative in one of the most progressive districts in the state of Michigan to not sign onto the Green New Deal. So, why does Representative Dingell not share this goal? Could it be the thousands of dollars she has taken from energy companies?
Rep. Dingell has refused to support the Green New Deal. Rep. Dingell’s
most significant piece of environmental legislation is the National Climate Bank bill. This bill would use public investment in private companies to attempt to stimulate development that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Dingell proposes a $35 billion investment in private industry over 6 years. This means we are giving public funds to private companies, instead of investing these public funds into green technology to decarbonize our economy now. This bill is giving money to the companies that destroyed our environment, and we can not trust these enterprises that have constantly found new ways to dodge environmental regulation. It would
﻿be different if Rep. Dingell supported a public-private collaboration as well as significant public investment and the GND, but she has refused to sign the GND.
Law Enforcement & Civil Rights
Solomon supports defunding our police departments and reinvesting this funding into community serviceslike education, mental/bodily health resources, sexual assault and domestic abuse help, as well as a new kind of law enforcement that is rooted in community enforcement. Solomon does not support decreased accountability for cops, and believes that every cop that has committed an act of brutality or discriminatory behavior must be prosecuted under the greatest extent of the law.
In 2018, Rep. Dingell voted for H.R. 5698, the Protect and Serve Act. This Act creates a new crime for attacks targeted at law enforcement, and expands police protections. Dingell’s vote has been condemned by the ACLU because police officers have significant protections already, and this would allow prosecutors to tack on another crime for victims of our unethical criminal justice system. This bill sadly propagates the ""war on police"" narrative, one which is untrue as we have seen
an uptick in police militarization and funding throughout the years. Even if she has changed her stance in recent weeks, a Congress person should be judged on their actions taken when the world is not watching.
Immigration
Solomon believes we must abolish ICE because they are terrorizing our borders. We must re-allocate their funds to the Department of Justice and to efforts to help asylum seekers.
Representative Dingell does not support abolishing ICE.
Legalizing Marijuana
Solomon supports immediately federally legalizing marijuana, expunging the records of those who have and are still serving marijuana convictions, and he also supports fair licensing laws to ensure that recreational growing and selling is not monopolized by white and wealthy individuals.
Rep. Dingell has recently spoken out about how she believes that marijuana should be federally legal. However, in 2015 she voted against an amendment that would make it easier to legalize marijuana. Specifically, she voted against the McClintock Polis Amendment, which would have made it easier for states to legalize marijuana and protect them against federal interference in this issue. Only 24 democrats voted against this bill -- and Rep. Dingell was one of them. This Amendment did not pass, however if it did, this could have helped stop thousands of senseless drug convictions all across the country.
Military Spending
In 2019, our nation’s military budget has accounted for more than 50% of our annual spending. This is ridiculous. Somehow we have enough money to destabilize other countries, but not enough to provide health care or tuition free public education to the people in our country. Solomon promises to never vote for a military budget increase, and instead advocate for defunding our military and the reapportionment of this funding into clean transportation and creating a green economy that will benefit the entire world, instead of terrorize other countries.
Rep. Dingell did not support Trump’s military increase in 2019, however she did support the military increase in 2018. A measure that many progressives did not support because they knew the consequences this increase would have in middle and low income countries.
Palestine & Israel
Solomon supports the BDS movement, and he supports a two-state solution negotiated by both parties. Solomon believes the United States must hold the Isreali government accountable for the human rights abuses that their occupation had caused. These abuses are also condemned by the U.N. When Solomon gets into office, he will immediately co-sign House Resolution 2407. Dingell has recently taken her name off of this resolution.
This past year, Representative Dingell removed her name from H.R. 2407, which bans U.S. funds from aiding military detention, abuse or maltreatment of Palestinan children. Even though the Representative supports a two state solution as well, Solomon supports withholding U.S. funds to Israel that will go towards the mistreatment of Palestinanes.
Affordable Housing
In Michigan's 12th district, housing insecurity is one of the biggest problems facing our community. In 2018, Ann Arbor rent went up 14 percent. We are seeing increasing gentrification in Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor. Solomon publicly supports federal rent control, and he believes this would provide a significant amount of relief to the residents of Michigan's 12th district
Representative Dingell has stayed
silent on the issue of rent control.
Nuclear Energy
Solomon believes that we should use clean sources of energy like solar panels, wind, and water energy in order to decarbonize our economy. Studies have shown that these technologies are able to meet America's energy requirements completely. Building nuclear energy plants takes years — and we do not have any time to waste, especially since we already have adequate technology. Solomon does not support increasing the use of nuclear energy because it will take too long to build, and also because nuclear energy creates dangerous nuclear waste as a byproduct. Why would we invest in an energy source that takes a long time to build and creates hazardous waste if we can create enough energy in this country through solar, wind, and hydroelectric?
In terms of disposing of the waste that is currently being made or already exists, Solomon supports consent based approaches. It should be mandated that the company that is dumping nuclear waste in a community informs the community of this, and the community agrees to take on this burden. Solomon also believes these communities should be given compensation for their sacrifice. We should only place nuclear waste in communities where the health and environmental impacts are the lowest.
Representative Dingell co sponsored HR 3053, a bill that has been condemned by many environmental organizations. In terms of nuclear energy, this bill would roll back public health standards, environmental standards, and would make it harder for communities to consent if waste is placed in their own community. Organizations like the League of Conservation Voters condemned this decision, and they instead advocated for a bill that did not roll back environmental and health regulations, and one that took a much more community consent based approach to nuclear waste.

141,"We need to protect the people of MI-12
I've been spreading awareness of COVID-19 relief for months. My team and I have been calling, texting, and canvassing
to tell as many people in MI-12 about resources that can
help anyone in need.
Last month, several activist organizations and I delivered the
Rent Strike 2020 petition to Gov. Whitmer's office.
The petition demanded that she suspend rent, mortgage, and
utility payments throughout the remainder of the pandemic.
Now, I am releasing my Coronavirus Response policy.
The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed horrible inequality and the inadequacy of our social safety nets. This situation has shown us more than ever that we can not prioritize profit over health. We must protect human lives before corporations in the fallout of this pandemic.
Housing
30 million people have filed for unemployment since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some businesses are foregoing rent themselves. I support the Rent and Mortgage Cancelation Act which would forgive unpaid rents and fees through one month past the official end of the pandemic by creating a relief fund for landlords and lenders. People should not be forced to pay for housing during this period of high layoffs and unemployment. Currently, Governor Whitmer has suspended evictions until June 11th, but residents must be protected from back-payment of rent.
Disproportionate Effect on POC
With the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen more incidences of
﻿hate crimes committed against Asian-Americans. This has largely been because the current narrative propagated by Trump's Administration, as well as several media outlets, that the Chinese people and the Chinese government are at fault for this entire pandemic. People of Color everywhere in the U.S. are being disproportionally effected by Coronavirus-related racism.
My policy focuses on issues facing Tribal Nations, racial bias
﻿within the healthcare system, COVID-19 cases among the incarcerated, the new immigration bans, and helping
Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Maria and Coronavirus.
Healthcare
It is obvious that I have been a constant supporter of Medicare For All, which would help mediate the inequities found in our current healthcare system while fighting Coronavirus. Before Medicare For All is implemented, private insurance should be required to cover all costs of COVID-19 in order to incentivize low-income citizens to seek the care they need. This will both save their lives and prevent community spread and future outbreaks. As well, mental healthcare during a pandemic is more important than ever. People find themselves staying at home in potentially unsafe situations. I would also mandate private healthcare companies to cover mental telehealth services with a patient's normal practitioners.
Voter Suppression
Because of the pandemic, there have been growing concerns about
the election in November and beyond. Although Trump and Republicans continue to be worried about the virtually non-existent problem of voter fraud, I support the expansion of voting by mail to ensure that our democracy is safe and intact.
Worker's Protections
$1,200 was not enough of a stimulus payment for working class Americans. I support Representative Tlaib's (MI-13) Automatic BOOST to communities Act, which would provide $2,000 to every person in America, and $1,000 every month until
﻿a year after the pandemic. This would include undocumented immigrants, dependents, and people who do not have bank accounts or a permanent address. This portion of the policy also covers issues facing sick leave, hazard pay, unemployment, and minimum wage.
Government Accountability
During this epidemic, the Trump Administration has taken advantage of the media cloud surrounding COVID-19. For example, the EPA is no longer enforcing environmental regulations, the Mashpee Wampanoag lands have been taken out of the national trust, and the halting of government services including visas and green cards. The media has hidden these examples of injustice during Coronavirus.
I will continue to bring light to examples of injustice during the pandemic, and also continue to take suggestions from the community for issues to shed light on.
Environmental Justice
The EPA has told companies that they do not need to meet environmental standards during the COVID-19 outbreak. It is important that environmental regulations continue to be enforced. This could have devastating consequences for the most vulnerable communities because a reduction in pollution could reduce the number of deaths resulting from COVID-19. We must ummediately reinstate the enforcement of environmental regulations during the pandemic. We must utilize the crash of the fossil fuel and natural gas industry to advocate for a transition to more reliable renewable energy.

142,"Ann Arbor Pride 2020 will be virtual amid Coronavirus pandemic
Tomorrow is Ann Arbor Pride 2020!
In the face of a massive pandemic, the Ann Arbor
LGBTQ community is connecting to celebrate
its resilience, diversity, and history.
This year, we can celebrate together from anywhere in the world
as Pride moves online. Like every other year, Ann Arbor Pride
is offering the same amazing events like free yoga, bellydancing,
local Drag Revue, Queeraoke, and musical guests.
The events will be available via live stream on
Facebook and YouTube from 10am to 8:30pm.
The LGBTQ community in MI-12 will not be silenced
in the face of COVID-19. Our community can still thrive
and enjoy vibrant festivals while social distancing.
""Equality means more than passing laws. The struggle is really won in the heats
and minds of the community where
it really counts.""
Barbara Gittings, gay rights activist
It is no surprise to anyone who has been following my campaign that I am in full support of the LGBTQ+ community. Nobody should be forced to be ashamed of who they are. Everyone should be treated with the dignity and respect they rightfully deserve.
I have always supported the Equality Act which would
provide consistent and explicit non-discrimination protections
for LGBTQ+ individuals, including housing, employment,
credit, education, safe public spaces and services,
federally funded programs, and jury service.
Inclusive and Accurate Sex Education
I will focus on passing federal legislation to adopt a comprehensive sex education curriculum. I support providing birth control and STI prevention tools to high schools. We need legislation to allow anyone to buy condoms at any age as a public health intervention to increase STI prevention in minors.
Mental Health
LGBTQ+ high schoolers are more than 5 times more likely
to attempt suicide than their peers, so I support increasing the number of mandated counselors in schools.
About 50% of transgender adults have contemplated
﻿suicide in the past year, so I support requiring LGBTQ+ specific training for healthcare providers.
Justice for Hate Crimes
There are no hate crime laws in Michigan that cover gender identity or sexual orientation. 17% of hate attacks against property and persons are motivated by sexual orientation, often committed against transgender and non-binary people. I support stronger prosecution and investigation into hate crimes.
Parenting Rights
I support Michigan's adoption statutes that allow married same-sex couples to jointly adopt children. However, right now surrogate parent contracts are void and unenforceable against the birth mother if the surrogate decides to deny male gay couples parental rights. I support the necessary intervention to provide full parental rights to same-sex couples who have children through tissue donation.
Military Spaces
The efforts to ban trans people from the military
by the Trump administration are despicable.
Making these attacks on their civil liberties is not only bigoted but baseless. I affirm the right of trans people
to serve in the military without any federal barriers,
as well as assuring that any medical procedures
including gender transitioning are paid for.
Safe Public Spaces
Any individual should be able to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable using. The federal government must provide grants and incentives to encourage renovations for gender neutral bathrooms, specifically in public schools.
""In every election, each vote matters. Races at all levels often are decided by a handful
of votes, with great consequences about policies that affect our lives.""
-Ann Arbor Pride
Whether you are voting for me in the August 4 election or not, registering to vote is more important in 2020 than ever.
I would love your support at the polls, but the weight of the 2020 presidential election can not be put into words.
Please support the efforts of Ann Arbor Pride by learning about LGBTQ+ issues, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the services of Sage Services & Advocacy for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & Transgender Elders.
I look forward to enjoying Ann Arbor Pride 2020 with you all from the safety and comfort of my desk.
Happy Pride!
Remember to vote!
The Michigan congressional primaries are one month away! I would love your support in the polls. Please be sure to vote in person or though absentee ballot by 8:00pm August 4.

143,"When we are keeping kids in cages, there is no justice. Nobody wants to be fleeing their country for safety. We need to return to being the compassionate people that we are.
Abolish ICE
ICE racial profiling
ICE has been caught with racial profiling but has not been held accountable. For example, in 2015, 70% of immigrants that were deported were Mexican. Additionally, in 2014, Latino vehicle occupants were 24% percent more likely to be asked to display identification than Caucasian vehicle occupants.
We will return some of the functions of CBP and ICE to other agencies like the Department of Justice, the State Department, and the Treasury Department.
Family separation
The Trump Administration’s “zero tolerance” policy causes children to be separated from their parents at our borders. Since 2017, more than 5,400 children have been separated from their families.
Done Waiting strongly opposes this practice.
Trafficking
One of the Trump administration’s largest arguments for their heinous policies is as a defense against drug trafficking and human trafficking. The intense criminalization at our borders actually increases human trafficking and since drug and human trafficking are already crimes, we do not need to criminalize immigration.
Done Waiting wants to overhaul the current system, and all enforcement agencies will be switched away from a mindset of law enforcement to one of humanitarian action. This will allow agents to more accurately look out for signs of human trafficking, instead of criminalizing individuals who are simply trying to search for a safer life for themselves and their families.
Close down Guantanamo Bay
The Guantanamo Bay detention center is essentially the US military’s permanent torture center. Historically, many of the inmates at the prison were innocent. The United Nations has previously called on the United States to close the prison. This prison must be closed.
Detention Centers at the Border
Done Waiting does not support the current treatment that families are subject to in detention centers at our border. We support all of these families being released into housing facilities that are NOT concentration camps, allowing families to stay together, allowing children to attend schools, and allowing them to safely await their hearings and placements.
DACA Recipients
Done Waiting supports reinstating DACA so more childhood arrivals can enjoy deferred action to deportation and the benefits of a work permit.
Recipients of DACA are more likely to engage in the workforce and DACA decreases the unemployment rate for DACA recipients.
Expand DACA to include Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA)
Latino citizen children have been shown to have traumatic experiences when their family has suffered deportation.
We must protect the health of our community members and take into account the humanity of people.
By including DAPA as a deferred plan of action for undocumented migrants we protect communities of migrants who have relationships in the United States.
Pathways to Citizenship
Done Waiting believes that every undocumented person currently residing in the United States should have a clear and likely pathway to citizenship.
We must support increased funding to immigration agencies to ensure that these agencies have enough money to process the backlog of people applying for immigration visas through legal means.
Read our FULL policy below.

Eric Early for Congress Endorsed by
Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy
On the heels of a blockbuster fundraising quarter, the GOP challenger to Adam Schiff has locked up another major endorsement
LOS ANGELES, Calif. \- Today, GOP Congressional candidate and prominent attorney Eric Early, has announced the endorsement from Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of his campaign to unseat Rep. Adam Schiff. The endorsement comes on the heels of a blockbuster fundraising quarter for Early who raised more than $795,000 last quarter entirely from individual donors across the United States.
“Eric Early has earned my endorsement and full support in his fight to unseat Congressman Adam Schiff. As a successful business owner, Eric understands our free market economy and the need to defeat the socialist agenda that now controls Schiff’s Democrat Party.""
""The good people of Southern California’s 28th Congressional District have been neglected for far too long by Schiff, while he has focused on attacking the President. Eric Early has a plan to finally take meaningful steps to fight the District’s homeless epidemic, support law enforcement and law and order, and help the District’s job creators rebuild from the effects of Covid-19 – but first we must defeat Adam Schiff. I hope you join me in supporting Eric Early for Congress.” - House Minority Leader, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).
The race for California's 28th Congressional District in years past has seen lackluster enthusiasm from GOP supporters with past challengers failing to raise the money requisite to compete. This year however, in large part due to Early's strong campaign, the Republican challenger is gaining momentum and capitalizing on Schiff's failed partisan charades and neglect of district residents.
""I am honored to receive Leader McCarthy's endorsement and I am beyond grateful to the thousands of patriotic Americans across our country that have helped us start closing the fundraising gap,"" said GOP candidate Eric Early. ""Adam Schiff raised millions of dollars off his lies to the American people and all the while the residents in our District have seen out-of-control homelessness, rising crime, thousands of independent contractor jobs destroyed and now the devastation caused by COVID. The role of a member of the House of Representatives is to advocate for their constituents in Washington. Schiff, instead, has solely focused on hatching political schemes while conditions in our District have deteriorated massively. That all ends this November.”
Eric Early's campaign has challenged Adam Schiff to numerous debates in-District, yet a date and location has not been accepted by Schiff.

Friend,
On June 1st, I marched with protestors in Atlanta. The crowds -- composed of people from various ethnicities and gender identities -- declared that ALL Black lives matter.
We heard from Atlanta City Councilmen Antonio Brown and Matt Westmoreland as they acknowledged that Atlanta has been plagued with systemic racism that has created and sustained an underclass who are finding it more and more difficult to climb out of poverty.
We heard from local Black Lives Matter activists and attorneys who spoke the names of Black women and men who have died at the hands of unchecked police violence in this city.
And we heard from activists who detailed clear policy proposals, including the implementation of the Obama Policing Initiative in Atlanta, a state hate crimes law, and state laws that reflect California’s bold effort to protect its citizens against dangerous, irresponsible police.
All of these voices acknowledged that white supremacy and anti-Black violence are the root of this country’s most systemic issues. And we all marched peacefully in an organized fashion to amplify this message. Unfortunately, we were met with hostility from law enforcement along the way as the Atlanta Police Department, Highway Patrol, and the National Guard kettled us downtown on Washington and Trinity.
Their presence was meant to strike fear in us. No one felt they were there to protect us. We all felt they were there to intimidate and mute our voices and push the narrative that protestors are unorganized, violent, and destroying neighborhoods. But we stood strong and continued to chant the names of Black lives -- locally and nationally -- that have been choked off by police violence. I, and the others standing alongside me, demanded to be released from the sidewalks where they confined us. We demanded that they cease their attempts to control our movements and herd us like sheep. Law enforcement eventually dispersed and allowed us to continue with our demonstration.
An hour later, the crowd that started at around 200 in number grew to thousands as people continued for three hours to march peacefully from the MLK Memorial Site on Auburn Ave. to Centennial Olympic Park, parts of Midtown, back through Downtown, and ending at the MLK Memorial Site.
The feeling and spirit in the air was not one of fear or sadness, it was one of power and possibility. The organizers and protestors I spoke with were all hopeful that change in this country is on the way, and that white supremacy’s grip on this nation’s institutions and leadership is becoming obsolete. We marched because we hate what this country has been to Black, Brown, and Indigenous people, but love what it could be if we continue to collectively fight for those that this country has dehumanized and exploited.
So, if you agree, or if you want to learn about what we march for, then join Team Sarah for a protest this Saturday, June 6th, at Big Bethel AME Church in Atlanta from 11 a.m. - 3 p.m.
JOIN US
I am proud to not only stand alongside the thousands of Atlantans in protest against anti-Black violence, but I am also proud to staff Sarah Riggs Amico’s U.S. Senate Campaign as the Director of Faith Outreach -- because I know that she values Black life.
To defeat white supremacy in this country, we need leaders who understand that the soul of this country is on trial. We need leaders who have proven that they are committed to dismantle white supremacy’s deadly stronghold on this country. We need leaders who will listen to marginalized communities and act swiftly against injustice. We need leaders who understand the dangerous and often deadly intersections of race, class, and gender identity and whose policies uplift the inherent worth and dignity of all human beings, especially those historically declared unworthy by this country. We need leaders with, in the words of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love who desire to be servants.
I am confident that Sarah Riggs Amico is that servant leader, and that she will take the pain, cries, and demands of the people with her to this nation’s capital.
Will you join us in protest on Saturday? Sign up here.
Thank you,

Ya'at'eeh Alex,
Black Lives Matter.
On Saturday June 6, there were protests across the country regarding the murder of George Floyd and institutionalized white supremacy. In DC tens of thousands of protesters marched and rallied throughout the city. I made a sign and joined this historic march.
The front of my sign read “Black Lives Matter” and the back of the sign had the word “We” crossed out and read “All the People.” I wanted everyone to know that I stand in solidarity with the African-American community and, as a presidential candidate, I unequivocally state that “Black Lives Matter”. But I also wanted people to know the reason that, to this day, we need to state “Black Lives Matter” in this country is because of what is written in our Constitution.
The United States of America is not racist, sexist and white supremacist in spite of our foundations. No, the unfortunate truth is that we are racist, sexist and white supremacist because of our foundations.
Last Wednesday, President Trump tweeted that he as been the best President since Abraham Lincoln for the African American community. And in a letter to his supporters, Joe Biden tried to remind them that “in some of our darkest moments of despair that we’ve made some of our greatest progress.” And the first example he gave was that after the Civil War we passed the thirteenth amendment.
So, after the public institutional lynching of George Floyd, both Donald Trump and Joe Biden sought to reassure our nation by claiming to uphold, and stand in solidarity with, the legacy of President Abraham Lincoln.
Time for a history lesson: Abraham Lincoln was a blatant white supremacist who didn’t give a crap about black lives. In a speech in 1858, he stated, “I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races.”
In response to an op-ed in 1862 calling for the immediate emancipation of enslaved people, President Lincoln responded with a letter stating the following: “My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that.”
That quote has been etched into marble stone and is hanging in the small museum located at the base of the Lincoln Memorial, proudly stating to all who pass by, that Abraham Lincoln did not believe that black lives matter.
So it should be no surprise that the thirteenth amendment, the cornerstone of Abraham’s Lincoln’s legacy (ratified in 1865), doesn’t actually abolish slavery: “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.”
The thirteenth amendment merely redefines and codifies slavery under the jurisdiction of the criminal justice system.
The very system that lynched George Floyd.
Any meaningful reform to our criminal justice system must begin with the complete and full abolishment of slavery. The clause in the thirteenth amendment must be removed. So while Joe Biden and Donald Trump are promising to lean into the legacy of a very blatant white supremacist named Abraham Lincoln, I am the only candidate in the 2020 Presidential election whose platform seeks to break with the legacy of Abraham Lincoln by actually abolishing slavery.
Dealing with these issues at the foundational level is why I’m running for President. And so after I marched with the public, loudly proclaiming to the nation, and even the world, that “Black Lives Matter,” I walked down Constitution Ave and stood in front of the National Archives to protest the root of the problem - the United States Constitution.
Over the past two weeks, interest in our campaign has grown rapidly as I am the only Presidential candidate whose platform deals with the foundations and calls for the abolishment of slavery. Our campaign for #AllThePeople has an incredible opportunity to not only deepen, but even help direct the national dialogue on police reform. But we need your help. Please continue to promote our campaign. The campaign announcement video continues to be one of the best tools we have to address the challenges our country is facing.
We are working hard to collect signatures remotely in the states of New Mexico, Alaska, North Dakota and New Hampshire. And we are also raising money to pay the $35,000 fee to get on the ballot in Oklahoma.
So far, in just the first week of June, we have raised nearly $4,500 towards our goal of $50,000. This is a great sign that we may have our best fundraising month to date. And so we ask you to please consider donating to our campaign today.
Ahéhee’ my relatives. Walk in Beauty.

Hey there,
Last week, Captain Brett Crozier, commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, sounded the alarm about his sailors' lives being put at risk as COVID-19 was spreading throughout the aircraft carrier.
This may have broken the Navy chain of command, but Captain Crozier did what any great leader does in unprecedented times; he took a risk and put his own career on the line to save the lives of his troops. But instead of being heralded for his brave action, our leadership structure has closed ranks and removed him from command.
Captain Crozier took an oath to defend our country against all enemies, foreign and domestic. In sending this letter, he upheld that oath. He was protecting his ship against the silent and deadly COVID-19 virus.
I know what it means to have the system fail you. Sixteen years ago, shortly after joining the Marines, I was sexually assaulted by a fellow Marine Officer. I reported the crime, I cooperated with the investigation, but the Marine Corps failed to prosecute. I fought to bring my attacker to justice, and I took a lot of risk in the face of the opposition from my command, in order to be certain that the man who attacked me never hurt another Marine.
Part of being a leader is standing up and speaking truth to power. Captain Crozier knew he was taking a risk when he sent that letter without the supervision of his command. Just as I knew I was taking a risk when I worked with civilian authorities without the consent of my command to prosecute the Marine who assaulted me.
Now, more than ever, we need leaders like Captain Crozier who are willing to raise the alarm.
Add your name to join me in calling on all our elected officials to hold the Navy leadership's feet to the fire and demand that the very real issues raised by Captain Crozier are addressed to protect our service members instead of trying to sweep it all under the rug. Sign our petition today.
SIGN THE PETITION
Thank you,
Claire

149,"BREAKING: ""Betsy DeVos Changed The Rules For How Schools Handle Sexual Assault Reports, And Advocates Say It Will Hurt Survivors""
\-- Buzzfeed News, 5/6/2020
We think our government and schools should be increasing protections for survivors of sexual assault, not rolling them back. But we want to know your thoughts. Take our short poll today >>
Last week, Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos issued new rules around sexual assault on college campuses, making it harder for survivors to get the justice they deserve.
We think it's pretty cut and dry: colleges and our government should be doing everything they can to protect survivors.
For Claire, these new rules are personal. As a survivor of sexual assault, Claire understands first hand how difficult it is for victims to report the crimes committed against them -- and she knows from experience how important due process is to our justice system.
But these rule changes make it harder to report sexual harassment and assault -- making our students less safe. Our universities are facing a crisis of sexual assault and harassment, and Betsy DeVos has shown time and time again she is not looking out for the safety of our students. In Congress, Claire will be committed to protecting survivors.
We want to know where you stand on this issue, team:
Do you think that we need to increase protections for survivors of sexual assault? Take our one question poll now >>
Yes No
Thank you,
Team Russo

150,"Make your voice heard
Friends,
Since 1918, there have been nearly 200 failed attempts to make lynching a federal crime.
What you do now will determine if our next attempt fails again, or if we finally get it done. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Tim Scott have a bill that has strong bipartisan support. It would pass and be sitting on the President's desk to sign or veto -- but Mitch McConnell won't bring it to the floor for a vote. Yesterday, it took only one extremist Senator to block it.
This isn’t partisan. There are plenty of votes in both parties to pass this. That’s why Mitch McConnell won’t allow a vote. He wants it to fail for what is close to the 200th time.
Contact your Senator. Demand that a vote be held. Sign my petition and make your voice heard today >>
In this moment where we must come together as a country to meaningfully discuss steps toward ending centuries of systemic racism, what a horrible message the failure of this bill would be. Passing this bill is far from the only thing we must do to combat injustice and racism, but when we have an opportunity to right an obvious wrong with bipartisan support, we must seize it.
We cannot let Mitch McConnell stop what is so clearly the right thing to do.
Thank you.

Law Enforcement Community Endorses Anna Paulina Luna
Saint Petersburg, FL\- Today, Anna Paulina Luna announced that Pinellas Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, the Sun Coast Police Benevolent Association, and the Florida Police Benevolent Association endorsed her against Charlie Crist in the race for Florida's 13th Congressional District.
Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said:
""Anna Paulina Luna is not your average candidate. When politicians seem more concerned about having power than delivering results, Anna stands out because she's different. A military veteran from humble beginnings, Anna experienced and overcame more than most. Anna is about taking action and getting the job done. She respects law enforcement and the people we serve. We know Anna will be a strong partner as we work to keep our communities safe.""
The Florida Police Benevolent Association is the largest professional association for law enforcement officers in Florida. They said:
""We are proud to endorse Anna Paulina Luna for the United States House of Representatives District 13. She demonstrates a steadfast commitment to the men and women of law enforcement and corrections. We know she will always have our back.""
Anna Paulina Luna said:
""It's my honor to have the support of Sheriff Gualtieri and the broader law enforcement community.
Growing up, I experienced poverty, drug abuse in my family, crime in all my surroundings, and incarceration of those close to me. I understand what it's like to be wary of law enforcement.
But, the fact is that law enforcement officers and their families overwhelmingly are good people who are so dedicated to serving their communities that they put their own lives at risk. This fact should stop being ignored by our leaders in Congress as they debate and decide the future of law enforcement and policing in this country.
Like Charlie Crist, many hollow politicians turned their backs on our brave officers. But these politicians also turned their backs on the many families, seniors, business owners, and other ordinary people of all races, backgrounds, and beliefs who depend on law enforcement officers to protect them.
Safe communities are the foundation of a strong economy and a high-quality way of life.
The law enforcement community deserves our respect and support. We can address the wrongdoings of a small few without targeting and tarnishing the many who are brave and helpful every day.""

Hello Alex
The weather is warm, Iowa is reopening, and Planting Season 2020 is full steam ahead. You can almost feel June 2 coming fast.
With just 30 days left until this election, I've been putting up 100s of yard signs and barn signs across our district. The momentum our campaign is feeling has been overwhelming. I'm humbled by messages of support from longtime friends and newly inspired supporters.
At this time, I only have ONE question for you: How can you help lead our grassroots campaign to victory?
If you don't have an answer, I can make a few suggestions...
1\. Have you voted? Absentee voting started last week and you should have received a request form in the mail. If you didn't, print this form out and mail it to your county auditor. Casting your ballot is the best way to make sure we get the support we need to win on June 2.
ABSENTEE BALLOT REQUEST
2\. Have a yard/barn sign? To show your support, get ahold of one of our yard signs. They're moving out the door fast so be sure to let us know you want one or have a good spot for a 4x8 sign TODAY.

CALL YOUR NEIGHBORS
4\. Have you seen last week's debate? If not, click here to watch. Please share the link far and wide; it's critical voters know who is looking to represent them. Coming off of a strong showing, I'm confident Iowans will make the right choice in this election.

Hello Alex
Over 80% of Americans want term limits. Think about that: 80%. You can't get 80% of people in a room to agree on the temperature of the thermostat. WHY can't we pass something that 260 million people want passed? Because politicians don't care about us, they care about their careers.
I'm counting on your help to change DC by sending someone like you, your neighbor—someone who cares more about our country than moving to the next taxpayer job—to Congress. I'm committed to serving five terms and coming home. How do you know I'll do what I say? Because it's who I am and I'm guessing it's who you are also. As Iowans, integrity is important to us.
On Friday, the news out of DC was discouraging once again as the DOJ decided not to charge Andrew McCabe with a crime. The Inspector General said he lied under oath. Would any one of us get a pass for lying under oath? I doubt it. Why do politicians and bureaucrats continually get by with breaking the law. The answer is simple, we let them.
Together, we can make a difference. I need your help TODAY. Email us right now at [[URL REDACTED]] Don't wait until after dinner.
Get your friends involved, like and share our Facebook page, make calls, knock doors, put up signs, and yes make a contribution. Anything you can do to help will make a difference.

😷 China's Lies Threaten Us All | Bret Richards for Congress
For months, the Communist Chinese government misled the world and we're now facing deadly consequences at home. China only cares about China. We need to come together as Americans, face facts, and realize the growing threat.

Hello Alex
I hope you and your family are doing well and staying healthy.
Because there's no school, sports, or routine right now, it might seem like the world has stopped. But the election keeps going!
We have just SIX WEEKS to go until Primary Day, but did you know voting starts THIS THURSDAY?
Iowa's Secretary of State and your County Auditors' offices are working very hard to make sure you and your neighbors can safely cast your ballot by absentee before June 2nd. Don't let all their hard work go to waste.
Request your absentee ballot TODAY, fill it out for #TeamBret, and send it back to your County Auditor.
ABSENTEE BALLOT REQUEST
Don't wait to vote this time around. With limited polling locations in June, you won't want to waste time waiting in line to make your voice heard.
No matter how you vote, keep in mind those who haven't yet been liberated. In Communist China, over one billion people don't have that right. Their voices have been silenced. When the people don't get a say, you get runaway centralized government that puts the people's wishes last.
Everyday there's a bit more information that comes out about how China tried to cover up what they knew about COVID-19. But for decades, this has been the playbook. China has been lying about their human rights abuses, trade manipulation, and cybercrime against the American homeland.
For far too long we've blindly trusted China. The Communist Party will starve their own people if it means they can have more power. What do you think they will do to us Americans if we get in their way?
Your right to vote is precious. Use it and make a difference. Otherwise, we might get an out-of-control government that could care less what the people think.
May God continue to watch over you and bless our great country.

155,"Dear Friend,
While the past few months have been undoubtedly hard for all of us, I want to take a moment to acknowledge how painful this time has been for our Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, especially as we come to the end of the first full week of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.
This should be a joyful time for our community -- one where we celebrate our history and our diverse cultures -- but with both the spread of coronavirus and the rise in anti-Asian American discrimination that has accompanied it, this year feels different.
Asian American-owned businesses have been disproportionately impacted by this crisis, even before shelter-in-place and social distancing orders, because of misinformation spread about the virus. Too many AAPIs have been harassed and even physically attacked. And rather than condemning this disturbing trend, our president and high-ranking Republican members of Congress have repeatedly used a racist term for the coronavirus.
If you have experienced a hate crime or bias incident in New York, you can report it by emailing the Attorney General’s Civil Rights Bureau at [[URL REDACTED]], or by calling 1-800-771-7755.
If there's one thing I know about our community, it's that we're stronger together. We can look to AAPI trailblazers from our past, from Larry Itliong to Patsy Mink, to inspire us to keep moving forward, fighting against hate, and supporting one another. We can also look to the daily courage and sacrifice of the more than 2 million AAPIs who are working on the frontlines of this pandemic. They are our nurses, doctors, grocery and convenience store owners and employees, janitors, law enforcement officers, transportation workers, and so many other kinds of essential workers -- and they are keeping us safe each and every day. This month and every month, I'm committed to fighting for our AAPI communities and for every community that needs a voice in our government.
I hope this email finds you and your family safe and healthy. I'll be thinking of you, and will continue to reach out with updates as this crisis continues.
Wishing you all the best,
Grace

156,"Your campaign brief for July 11, 2020 View this email in your browser
Hey Alex -
Dan Crenshaw here. I hope you are well.
This week, I continued to call for a strategy to reopen schools in the fall and also spoke out against calls to defund the police. In case you missed it, I also published an op-ed last week about why we need to fight hard to tell the right story of America.
Follow me on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for regular updates and news you can use. As always, thank you for your support.
Now, here’s your brief:
WE NEED TO SAFELY REOPEN SCHOOLS IN THE FALL
Kids and their parents have suffered the most from the impact of extended school closures. Students aren’t learning as much, child abuse is on the rise, and parents are struggling to juggle home-schooling and their jobs. It’s why I’m calling for a strategy to reopen schools in the fall.
The American Academy of Pediatrics agrees. In a recent report published by AAP, the organization “strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school.”
We cannot ignore the educational, social, and other public health harms inflicted upon our families by extended school closures. We need to do everything in our power to get kids back to school safely.
DEMOCRAT POLICIES PUT THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AT RISK
The data coming out of New York City is troubling. Violent crime is skyrocketing while the New York Police Department faces a troubling surge of officers filing for retirement. We’re watching the results of Democrat governance in real time. Encourage the mob, defund the police, “bail reform,” while communities are torn apart.
What’s worse? According to the NYPD, “every single person who has been shot in New York City this July, nearly 100 in total, has been a member of the minority community and 97% of shooting victims in June were members of the city’s minority communities.”
As I have said before, those leading the calls to defund the police live in neighborhoods that won’t suffer the effects of this radical policy. Minority communities suffer the most when police cannot do their jobs, which is why I have spoken out against this policy so forcefully.
America must wake up to the reality of allowing Democrats to win in November. The safety of our communities - all of our communities - is at stake.
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: WE NEED TO TELL THE RIGHT STORY OF AMERICA
We need to start telling the right story about America, or our great experiment unravels. In the last few weeks thousands have taken to the streets in protests that questioned whether America values all of its citizens with the same worth, and questioned whether the ideals upon which our great country was founded are good.
That’s why we must state unequivocally: America is good. In fact, it’s great.
In a recent op-ed in The Hill, I argue that while it’s important to recognize the sins of our country, we must also recognize that these sins do not render corrupt the foundational ideals of America. Our imperfections do not define us. What does define us is the greatness that America has generated.
Click here to read the op-ed.
Sign the pledge to elect leaders who will teach our kids to love America.

DAN CRENSHAW FOR CONGRESS
Alex -
Texas vs California. Good governance vs bad governance.
This is what’s at stake in November. Click here or on the image above to watch and share this with your friends.
Democrats are spending millions to flip the Texas State House, and our State Rep candidates desperately need help. It’s an emergency. Our prosperity is on the line.
Associated Republicans of Texas is working hard to support these candidates. Please chip in ANY AMOUNT IMMEDIATELY to help them GET OUT THE VOTE.
CHIP IN TO SAVE TEXAS
In Service,
Dan Crenshaw
FULL TRANSCRIPT
What makes for good governance?
Safe communities, Less regulations, lower taxes, and minimal interference from government - Giving people the freedom to make their own choices.
And what does bad governance look like?
Defunding the police, refusing to enforce the law, more regulations, higher taxes, and a government-knows-best attitude.
Don’t believe me? Well lets compare a large state run by Democrats, California, to a large state run by Republicans, Texas.
California, a beautiful state with millions of hardworking Americans. California rose to prosperity under Republican governance, but in recent decades it has been devastated by one party, Democrat rule. An unemployment rate of more than 11% - one of the highest in the country. The 4th highest electricity prices in the country. Rolling blackouts, forest fires, rising crime and homelessness.
The Tax Foundation ranks California 48th in terms of business climate. California is also ranked 48th in terms of regulatory burdens. And California’s cost of living is 50 percent higher than the national average.
Now, people are fleeing the state in droves. Businesses are closing down by the thousands. Jobs are leaving the state in record numbers.
In just 2018 and 2019—economic boom years—765 commercial facilities left California. Large companies like Toyota, Charles Schwab, and Jamba Juice.
An estimated 13,000 businesses left between 2008 and 2016. 275,000 jobs left the state and $76 billion in capital funds were diverted during the same period.
And where are these jobs fleeing to? Texas.
More than 86,000 people moved to Texas from California in 2018 alone. A U-Haul from Los Angeles to Houston costs more than $2,000. A U-Haul from Houston to Los Angeles costs $600.
The reason is simple. We have smart policies that work. We empower people instead of trying to control them.
Texas has no personal income tax. Our unemployment rate is just half of California’s even though our COVID trends were similar. Texas has some of the lowest electricity prices in the country. Texas is the best state in America to start a new business, according to studies.
We also treat the environment better. We are a leader in energy innovation and wind power, and our emphasis on private land ownership makes it much easier to manage forests and prevent wildfires.
So you have to ask yourself, why switch form good governance to bad governance?
Millions of dollars are flooding into Texas to make our state more like California. They’re trying to “Turn Texas Blue” and they won’t stop until they control our state legislature, control the Governor’s mansion, and flip our U.S. House and Senate Seats.
We have to stop them.
The front line of this defense to save Texas is the Texas State House, and we have incredible young, diverse candidates that need our help as they fight against millions of dollars of out-of-state donations from the likes of far-left billionaires like Mike Bloomberg and George Soros.
We need to keep Texas prosperous. We need to Keep Texas free. We need to keep Texas REPUBLICAN.
When you donate to Associated Republicans of Texas, you donate to a one stop shop for saving the Texas State House. We need your help. Its all on the line. Donate today, save Texas.

Ashley Hinson on Immigration in 2020: Work Together to make America More Secure, More Safe, and Better Equipped to Handle Workforce Needs
2019 was the year the U.S. immigration system reached a breaking point. Last February more than 76,000 migrants crossed the border without authorization—an 11-year high—and arrests along the southern border increased 97 percent.
Even facing a clear crisis, Washington politicians continued to make immigration about politics instead of national security. As a result, the security crisis at our border also evolved into a humanitarian crisis with rampant human trafficking and drugs like fentanyl pouring into our communities and fueling the opioid crisis.
We can’t afford a February like our last. That’s why I’m calling on Congress to shift their focus away from impeachment and onto finally fixing our broken immigration system.
First and foremost, we must support increasing funding for border security. We can’t fix our immigration system without first securing the border. Congress has approved billions for President Trump’s border wall but Democrats haven’t made it easy. We need to make sure security at the southern border is funded and Immigration Custom Enforcement Officers have the resources they need to stop violent criminals and dangerous drugs from entering our country.
Last year ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations arrested and convicted more than 200,000 individuals for crimes such as homicide, kidnapping, sexual assault, drugs and Driving Under the Influence but too often our border agents are pulled away from their law enforcement duties to tend to the humanitarian needs of the mass illegal immigration, making our borders less secure. ICE officers should have bipartisan support.
While we must focus on stopping heinous crimes and ending illegal immigration, we should also support legal immigration.
Immigrants are a huge asset to our culture, our economy, and they’re our neighbors and friends. In Iowa, immigrants are a vital component of our state’s labor force. According to the American Immigration Council, there are 96,089 immigrant workers in Iowa in various industries like manufacturing, educational services and construction.
It is critical that we fix our legal immigration system so states like ours can have workforce needs met. This means streamlining America’s skilled-worker visa system to make it easier for businesses to hire and retain the workers they need.
The U.S. Senate should move quickly to pass Senator Joni Ernst’s bill, Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act. This bipartisan legislation would move the per-country cap for employment-based green card applications, making it easier for talent across the world to bring their skills here.
With an immigration system in desperate need of repair, it’s no secret that our representatives instead shamefully focused on destroying the President. Extreme politicians need to stop putting politics over public safety and sensationalism over solutions.
The way forward to fix our immigration system is simple, but it’s a tall order for today’s partisanship: Democrats and Republicans should work together to make our nation more secure, more safe and better equipped to hire the best and brightest for our workforce.

I need to talk to you about my dad, Alan Cohn.
I’m so proud of him.
He’s running to flip one of the closest races in the country -- but he’s starting in debt after a very late primary.
I’ll be honest, I’ve never emailed asking strangers for money before. But I know what is at stake. My dad needs to raise $9,500 in the next 24 hours or he'll be forced to make devastating budget cuts. So I’m asking, please donate at this make-or-break moment >>
Let me explain:
Here's what you need to know about my dad: I’ve grown up watching my dad fight for what’s right, no matter what.
As an investigative journalist, he exposed defense contractors secretly installing defective parts on Black Hawk Helicopters, endangering the lives of our troops.
While reporting a story, he met a Vietnam Veteran with PTSD. The man was homeless, eating from trash bins, and had been wrongfully denied benefits because the government said he didn’t actually fight in Vietnam.
My dad flew across the country, hunted down his commanding officer, relentlessly challenged the Pentagon’s claim that the man didn’t serve in combat operations, and ultimately won $60,000 in back pay and a monthly benefits package for the Veteran.
He exposed corrupt politicians involved in an organized crime racket and a police brutality coverup that ultimately led to the officers being fired and charged.
I know my dad is exactly who we need fighting for us in Congress. If you agree, I’m asking you to chip in even just $5 so he can win >>
Here’s what you need to know about this race:
This is one of Democrats’ top opportunities to flip a seat blue.
Republicans have just a 1-point advantage in voter registrations.
This race will come down to just a handful of votes and every fundraising goal is critical.
How you can have a massive impact: My dad’s sticking to the values he taught me and my brother by running a people-first campaign.
That means he is rejecting all corporate PAC money.
The support of grassroots donors, like you, will determine if he wins or loses this race.

FACT: Ross Spano is the most vulnerable Republican in Florida \-- and some argue the country.
He has been exposed as a corrupt criminal who committed campaign finance fraud. He’s been under investigation by the Justice Department, the House Ethics Committee, and the Florida Bar for over a year and faces likely jail time for his crimes.

Democrats Can Win Florida in 2020. But they have to work a lot harder and they have to do it now.
A Republican hasn’t won the White House without winning Florida in over 100 years.
So if we’re going to oust Trump, Democrats need to win BIG in Florida.

FACT: The GOP is desperate to hold onto Ross Spano’s seat:
* Republican leadership PACs have given Spano $77,000.
* The NRA, fossil fuel industries, and corporate PACs are funneling him tens of thousands of dollars.
* And the GOP elite are POURING money directly into Spano’s campaign.
I’m so proud that my campaign is funded by union workers, educators, and other hard working Americans like you.

Alex,
Will you help us win the single most important senate race in 2020? My close friend and fellow veteran Senator Joni Ernst is on the ballot and she’s under attack.
Soros, Bloomberg, and liberal dark money groups are already pouring millions of dollars into Iowa to try to beat Joni.
Why? Because they know that Joni is a rock-solid conservative. She is pro-life. She opposes amnesty and sanctuary cities. She’s tough on crime, and she’s fought for conservative judges.
The Left knows that if they can beat Joni Ernst, they’ll be able to replace a conservative combat veteran with an open-borders socialist.
I don’t intend to let that happen. And that’s why I’m asking for your help. Will you make a contribution that will be split between my campaign and Joni’s?
With your help, we can win this race, and you can send Joni and me back to fight for President Trump’s agenda and oppose what the radical socialists are trying to do to our country.
In service,
Tom Cotton

Cotton Remarks on Voting Against Articles of Impeachment
Washington, D.C. — Earlier today, Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) submitted remarks into the Congressional Record announcing his intent to vote against both articles of impeachment. The text of those remarks in its entirety may be found below.
I will soon join a majority of the Senate in voting down the articles of impeachment brought against the president by his partisan opponents. The time has come to end a spectacle that has elevated the obsessions of Washington's political class over the concerns and interests of the American people.
This round of impeachment is just the latest Democratic scheme to bring down the president. I say ""this round"" because House Democrats have tried to impeach President Trump at least four times. First, for being mean to football players. Then for his transgender military policy. Next for his immigration policy. And those are just the impeachment attempts. Along the way, Democrats also proclaimed that Robert Mueller would drive the president from office. Some even speculated that the vice president and the cabinet would invoke the 25th Amendment to seize power from the president—a theory that sounds more like Resistance fan fiction than reality.
What's behind this fanaticism? Simply put, the Democrats have never accepted that Donald Trump won the 2016 election, and they will never forgive him, either.
It's time for the Democrats to get some perspective. They're claiming that we ought to impeach and remove a president from office for the first time in our history for briefly pausing aid to Ukraine and rescheduling a meeting with the Ukrainian president, allegedly in return for a corruption inquiry. But the aid was released after a few weeks and the meeting occurred, yet the inquiry did not—even though, I would add, it remains justified by the Biden family's obvious, glaring conflict of interest in Ukraine.
Just how badly have the Democrats lost perspective? The House managers have argued that we ought to impeach and remove the president because his meeting with the Ukrainian president happened in New York, not Washington.
When most Americans think about why a president ought to be impeached and removed from office for the first time in our history, I suspect that pausing aid to Ukraine for a few weeks is pretty far down the list. That's not exactly ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" And that's especially true when we're just months away from the election that will let Americans make their own choice. Indeed, Americans are already voting to select the president's Democratic challenger. Why not let the voters decide whether the president ought to be removed?
The Democrats' real answer is that they're afraid they'll lose again in 2020, so they designed impeachment to hurt the president before the election. As one Democratic congressman said last year, ""I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president, he will get reelected."" Or as Minority Leader Chuck Schumer claimed earlier this month, impeachment is a ""win-win"" for Democrats; either it will lead to the president's defeat or it will hurt enough Republican senators in tough races to hand Democrats the majority. Or maybe both.
The political purpose of impeachment was clear from the manner in which House Democrats conducted their proceedings. If impeachment was indeed the high-minded, somber affair that Speaker Nancy Pelosi claimed, House Democrats would've taken their time to get all the facts from all relevant witnesses. Instead, they barreled ahead with a slipshod and secretive process, denying the president's due-process rights, gathering testimony behind closed doors, leaking their findings selectively to the press, and ignoring constitutional concerns such as executive privilege.
The impeachment vote itself contradicted the pretensions of House Democrats. Speaker Pelosi said last year that she wouldn't support impeachment unless there was something ""so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan"" that it demanded a response. Likewise, Congressman Jerry Nadler said that the House had to ""persuade enough of the opposition party voters"" before it voted to impeach. Democrats failed on both counts. Indeed, the only bipartisan aspect of the whole proceeding is that both Republicans and Democrats voted against impeaching the president. Not a single Republican voted for either article of impeachment in the House, resulting in the first party-line impeachment of a president in our nation's history.
So instead of doing their work, House Democrats simply impeached the president and declared their job complete. Yet after piously declaring the urgency of this impeachment, they waited a month to send the articles over to the Senate. Maybe they had to wait for the gold-encrusted souvenir pens to arrive for Speaker Pelosi's ""signing ceremony.""
And once in the Senate, the political theater continued. The House Democrats repeatedly asserted a bizarre logical fallacy: their case was both ""overwhelming"" and in need of more evidence. Yet we heard from seventeen witnesses—all hand-selected by the House Democrats—and received more than 28,000 pages of documents. The House could've pursued more witnesses during its impeachment, yet it instead chose to rush ahead rather than subpoena those witnesses or litigate issues in federal court. In fact, when one of the House's potential witnesses asked a federal court to rule on the issue, the House withdrew its subpoena and asked to dismiss the case. The House Democrats complain that the courts would've taken too long, yet they expected the Senate to delay our work to finish theirs. And in a final, remarkable stunt, Congressman Adam Schiff suggested that we depose witnesses—only his, of course, not the president's—with Chief Justice Roberts ruling on all questions of evidence and privilege, dragging him into this political spectacle.
But the curtain will soon come down on this political theater. The Senate will perform the role intended for us by the Founders, of providing the ""cool and deliberate sense of the community,"" as it says in Federalist 63, over and against an inflamed and transient House majority. Were we to do otherwise, were the Senate to acquiesce to the House, this process might have dragged on for many weeks, even for months, shutting down the normal legislative business of Congress even longer than it already has.
Even worse, by legitimizing the House's flawed, partisan impeachment, we would be setting a grave precedent for the future. Just consider how many times we heard about the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson during this trial. The Founders didn't intend impeachment as a tool to check the executive over policy disagreements or out of political spite. And the House has never before used impeachment in this way. Not when the Democrats claimed that President George W. Bush misled the country into the Iraq War or when President Barack Obama broke the law by releasing terrorists from Guantanamo Bay in return for the release of an American deserter, Bowe Bergdahl. Indeed, the Republican House did not impeach President Obama for, yes, withholding aid from Ukraine for three full years.
No House in the future should lead the country down this path again. By refusing to do this House's dirty work, the Senate is stopping this dangerous precedent and preserving the Founders' understanding that Congress ought to restrain the executive through the many checks and balances still at our disposal. More fundamentally, we're preserving the most important check of all—an election. It's time to teach that lesson to this House and to all future Houses, of both parties.
Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff have failed, but the American people lost. Now it's time to get back to doing the people's business.

Alex,
The election is now just weeks away, and your actions in the coming days will be crucial for our success in November.
The good news is that, according to FiveThirtyEight, The New York Times’s release of Donald Trump’s tax history and business dealings has a “real potential to prevent Trump from making up ground on Joe Biden” \-- and Biden has continued to lead in national polls.
But FiveThirtyEight also reports that Trump’s strong polling on the economy could sway independent voters in critical states his way, which would give Trump the advantage as the election nears \-- just as it did in 2016 when independent voters in Florida, Michigan, and Wisconsin voted for Trump over Hillary Clinton on the economy, handing Trump the Electoral College by razor-thin margins.
We know from experience that Trump can rewrite the narrative on his tax crimes to win this election \-- like he did in 2016 when he overcame Clinton’s sizable polling leads to win the Electoral College. Our mission is to turn out Democratic voters in overwhelming numbers this election to exile Trump from the White House, take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell’s Republican majority, and expand our own House majority.
But the Trump campaign is now investing heavily in digital ads to turn out Trump’s supporters, outspending the Biden campaign by nearly $100 million. And The Hill now reports Democrats are worried “there might be a larger number of voters receptive to Trump’s...messaging than they’re seeing in the polls.” That’s why, with just a few weeks to go before the election, we can’t afford to fall behind on our fundraising goal \-- but that’s exactly what we’re doing right now.
Our work has always relied on the support of committed Democrats like you who are ready to fight against Trump’s far-right agenda. That’s why we’re reaching out now to ask for your support as we mobilize to turn out voters in this critical time. If we’re going to defeat Trump in November, take back the Senate, and expand our House majority, then we need you to donate now to turn out every single eligible Democrat and exile Trump from Washington.
We cannot thank you enough for standing with us now.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a resolution to condemn Donald Trump’s treatment of peaceful protesters \-- the ones the president had gassed and shot just so he could get his primetime photo-op.
Schumer said Trump’s actions were “appalling” and “an abuse of presidential power” \-- causing Mitch McConnell’s ears to perk up.
McConnell, who’s helped the president get away with abuse of power before, jumped at the chance to do so again \-- blocking the resolution and calling it an indulgence in Democrats’ “myopic obsession with President Trump.”
Maybe McConnell thinks his life would be easier if Americans simply paid no attention to Donald Trump and his crimes. With Trump at 54% disapproval nationally and McConnell at 48% disapproval in his home state, it’s clear why both men might want to avoid attention right now \-- should we let them off the hook?

Alex,
NPR: “Top congressional Democrats are calling for a federal investigation after a nurse who worked at an immigration detention center in Georgia filed a whistleblower complaint alleging a lack of medical care and unsafe work practices that facilitated the spread of COVID-19. She also says that immigrant women received questionable hysterectomies.”
ICE has a history of committing human rights abuses while emboldened under the Trump administration \-- first separating families at the border, then leaving migrant children in cages, and now, allegations have surfaced that a doctor in an ICE detention center performed mass hysterectomies on unknowing migrant women without their consent.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is demanding an investigative briefing on these alleged crimes by the end of the week \-- stating: “this profoundly disturbing situation recalls some of the darkest moments of our nation’s history.” But ICE officials are denying any fault.
Since Trump’s election, we’ve seen a rise in xenophobia and hate crimes targeting immigrants and communities of color. Despite mounting evidence of abuse taking place in detention centers across the country, Trump has praised ICE as “compassionate” and said if centers are too crowded, “tell them not to come to the USA.” Another four years of Trump’s inhumane leadership will completely erase the values this country was founded on, but nearly 50% of Americans approve of Trump’s immigration policy. Today we need to know, do you?
Do you condemn ICE's human rights abuses?
YES NO

Donald Trump has sent federal law enforcement to numerous American cities to, as he claims, restore law and order.
According to POLITICO, polls show that these recent political stunts haven’t exactly connected with their target audience: suburban voters.
Suburban voters seem to be rejecting Trump’s frequent warnings that a Joe Biden presidency would bring crime and mayhem \-- and rejecting Trump’s own use of force in cities such as Portland and Chicago.
Now, just like in the 2018 election, Trump and the GOP face the prospect of a suburban blue wave of Democratic voters.
However, there are three months left to Election Day \-- and Trump and the GOP will not go quietly.
Even during the blue wave of 2018, Republicans were able to win key Senate and gubernatorial races due to voter suppression \-- and they’ve committed $20 million to block voting rights before November this year.
And things were also looking good for Hillary Clinton before the 2016 election \-- before voter apathy and suppression handed Trump the White House.
That’s why we need you to commit today to voting for Joe Biden this November. Let us know now:

Attorney General Bill Barr has said that, no matter what Donald Trump wants, he won’t use the justice system to organize a show trial for former president Barack Obama \-- with Barr saying, “As long as I’m attorney general, the criminal justice system will not be used for partisan political ends.”
Trump, on the other hand, doubled down on his accusations \-- saying Obama should be made to testify before Congress as part of Trump’s claim that the former president committed “the biggest political crime in American history,” even though Trump can’t say what that crime is.
It looks like, for now, Trump’s cabinet is standing up to him. But the last time an Attorney General wouldn’t go along with Trump’s wishes, Trump fired him and replaced him with someone who would. If Trump does the same thing again, then President Obama could be forced to testify before a GOP-controlled Senate. That’s why we need to know, now:

179,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
President Trump is ranting on Twitter again. And, unfortunately, some of his latest tweets were racist.
In one tweet, Trump criticized NASCAR’s decision to ban the Confederate flag. He also called for Bubba Wallace, NASCAR’s only black driver, to apologize for an incident that the organization thought was a hate crime. The FBI later determined no crime was committed \-- and though the situation was not Wallace’s fault, the president still felt the need to belittle the driver on Twitter.
Next, Trump attacked Washington’s pro football team and the Cleveland Indians baseball team for starting discussions on changing their names away from Native American themes. For good measure, Trump ended his tweet by mocking Elizabeth Warren, a frequent target of his racial insults.
As Americans of all walks of life take to the streets to push for racial justice, we need leadership that can unite the country and help bring about an end to systemic racism. Instead, President Trump regularly helps to fan the flames of racial tension with his racist rhetoric on social media. We, as a nation, deserve better. Tell us:
Do you condemn the president's racism?
YES NO

180,"Hi Alex,
Recently, progressive icon Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made a statement tying poverty and unemployment to the uptick in crime throughout communities in New York City during the pandemic.
Republican Rep. Ted Yoho, who has never had a conversation with Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez before, accosted her on the Capitol steps, calling her “disgusting,” a “fucking bitch,” and told her, “You are out of your freaking mind.”
Several congressmen have spoken out against Yoho’s outbursts, including Rep. Dean Phillips, who tweeted, “Like @aoc, I believe poverty to be a root cause of crime. Wonder why Rep. Yoho hasn’t accosted me on the Capitol steps with the same sentiment?”
We know that GOP leaders like Florida Rep. Ted Yoho are scared of powerful women like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \-- and that they would never disrespect a congressional representative in the same manner. We’re appalled by the blatant sexism espoused by leaders who walk through our nation's capital each day \-- and at A Woman’s Place, we stand by Rep. Ocasio-Cortez. Today, we hope you will, too.
Do you stand with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?
YES NO

181,"Hi Alex,
The Hill’s political consultant Douglas Schoen recently warned that the “presidential race is much closer than many now think” as Joe Biden’s lead narrows across battleground states. Tightening national polls prove we will need an overwhelming vote to beat Trump in November, but in 2016, nearly 100 million voters stayed home and handed a misogynist four years in the White House.
Since then, we’ve seen a surge of anti-women legislation attacking our reproductive rights and access to health care, experienced nearly 200,000 American deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic, witnessed increasing hate crimes against communities of color and, most recently, overt attempts by the Trump administration to suppress the vote.
But this year, we have the power to change the path our country is on.
Women are a powerhouse in the U.S. electorate, currently accounting for Joe Biden’s lead in national polling. And there are a record number of progressive women running for office this year who are demanding our new leadership fight for families, racial justice, health care, and reproductive rights.
That’s why we’re determined to help as many progressive women as we can run successful campaigns, reach new voters, and create the diverse, representative government we’ve envisioned. But as election day approaches, the GOP is spending millions in key states across the country while running an aggressive campaign against vote-by-mail, a method over 50% of Democrats will use to turn in their ballots. And right now, we’re $2,491 short of where we need to be to endorse as many candidates as possible before this month’s FEC filing deadline.
Our country is at a turning point, and you play a crucial role in protecting Democratic control of the House, taking back the Senate, and electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris into the White House.
We have just 45 days left to vote Trump out of office and elect women who will fight for progressive policies and restore the values that will move our country forward. Can we count on you to contribute $5, $10, $25, or anything you can right now to ensure we elect leaders who will protect reproductive rights, champion racial equity, and defend affordable healthcare come November?
Thank you for joining our efforts to break the systemic barriers that keep women out of power and elect leadership we can be proud of.

182,"Hi Alex,
Federal agents tear gassed the mayor of Portland after he spoke in solidarity with people protesting. They have brutally attacked and abducted citizens off the streets, throwing them into unmarked vehicles, and destroyed medical supplies.
Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and public health scientist at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, spoke out stating, ""This is Fubar. The Geneva Convention states that destroying medical equipment is a war crime violation. Yet, here we are in Portland. Attacking medical units violates half a dozen conventions and international statutes. Not only the Geneva Convention, but also International Criminal Court statutes. But hey, Chad Wolf, Bill Barr, and Trump say it’s okay!""
Now, the president plans to deploy the agents into more cities across the country to stop the righteous protests of citizens seeking justice. Right now, we need to hear from you in our new survey to see where you stand:
Do you condemn Donald Trump?
YES NO

183,"Hi Alex,
Today, the House voted to impeach the president for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. I fully understand the seriousness of these charges and the vote our leaders just took.
Like our Democratic leaders, I agree that the president is guilty of abusing the vast powers of the office of the President and obstruction of Congress’s oversight abilities, and that these qualify as high crimes and misdemeanors that the Constitution, as laid out by our forefathers, identifies as grounds for impeachment.
Unlike our current representative, Brian Fitzpatrick, who did not have the courage to defy his party and do what’s right for the American people and our country, I would have been a strong “yes” vote to impeach the president today.
This is a somber day for the United States, but today’s vote was critical in making it clear that no one \-- not even the president \-- is above the law.
We have important fights ahead of us.

184,"Dear Patriot,
What an interesting time we are living in today. We are seeing leaders in the Democrat party calling the rioters destroying our cities ""peaceful protestors."" We are seeing Democratic Mayors refusing to accept help from the National Guard to quell riots in their cities. We’ve seen Kamala Harris urge protesters to not let up and encourage her supporters to help bail out the rioters, while Joe Biden’s campaign staff were also quick to donate to support the rioters. Meanwhile, D.C.’s Democratic Mayor, Muriel Bowser, has recommended renaming, relocating, or contextualizing nearly 50 DC sites, including the Washington Monument, Jefferson Memorial, Benjamin Franklin Statue, and many more.
If you want to know what a true Democratic takeover of Washington would look like, look no further than the Virginia General Assembly.
Just last week, left-wing Democratic delegates not only proposed cutting state police funding by 25% but also made an outlandish proposal in support of banning School Resource Officers schools across the Commonwealth.
In a further power trip, the Democrat-controlled Senate passed a bill—under the guise of fighting voter fraud—that actually allows “community organizers” to go door-to-door collecting live voter ballots and taking them to their base of operations before forwarding them to the ballot box.
What’s more, the House Courts of Justice Committee voted to advance House Bill 5148, to permit early release of prisoners for crimes including murder, rape, child pornography, cross burning and other forms of racial intimidation, domestic violence, and child prostitution.
A contribution of $5, $25, $50, or more from you today will help us to stop these preposterous ideas from spreading to Washington.
From stacking the ballot box to defunding the police, these are exactly the types of policies that my leftist opponent—Qasim Rashid—is eager to push in Washington. That’s why we must fight harder than ever to keep this seat red!
We can't afford another two years of Nancy Pelosi and her socialist lackeys in power. We need to fire Nancy Pelosi. And, we need your support to do this.
Can I count on you to chip in $50, $100, $250, $500 or even $1,000 today to help continue our grassroots success?
Your donation of any amount today will help us fight back against the lies the Democratic establishment is spreading!

I am proud to support my friend Tom Kean to represent New Jersey’s Seventh District in Congress.
As the Republican Leader in New Jersey’s State Senate, Tom fights for small businesses, working families, and he stands up against the liberal mob. He’s tough on crime, wants to secure our border, and has the chance to pick up a House seat that will help get Nancy Pelosi out of power.

Tom’s opponent Democratic Congressman Malinowksi is a liberal extremist who pretended to be a moderate but once he got to Washington he has done Nancy Pelosi’s bidding every time.
Malinowski votes with the socialist AOC 95% of the time. In fact, he’s so deranged that he threatened to withhold cleaning supplies to Kentucky because he was mad about Republicans.
We have the chance to replace a fanatical liberal who wants to withhold supplies from fellow Americans and we should do it.
Tom can win this race, but he can only do it with your help. Please, let’s help Tom Kean win and take back congress.
Please contribute any amount today to help elect Tom Kean to Congress.

July is shaping up to be an incredibly busy month. As Congress continues to deal with an unprecedented pandemic, corrupt leadership, civil rights protests, and more, Hank is stepping up to be a leader Americans can look to during these chaotic times.
Contribute now to support his fearless leadership and help him get re-elected in November!
Here’s just a glimpse into Hank’s recent work:
* Helping to author and pass a massive police reform bill in solidarity with protests around the country.
* Leading the charge to hold Attorney General Barr accountable for his many crimes against the American people including corruption and obstruction of justice.
* Standing with residents of Washington, D.C. as he voted to make our nation’s capital a state and give due representation to the hundreds of thousands of citizens who live here.
* Fighting back against President Trump’s callous disregard for working class families by demanding an extension to unemployment benefits for those who are struggling during this pandemic.
Hank has been so busy this month, we’ve fallen behind on our fundraising goal! That’s why we are putting together a plan to catch up on our fundraising goal, and it starts with asking our grassroots supporters to chip in $10 or $20.
DONATE NOW >>
Alex, we are so proud of how Hank has risen up to the task of digging America out of the hole that this crisis has worsened. He’s the bold, fearless, and outspoken leader we need during these times. Unfortunately that means he’s attracted a lot of powerful enemies: President Trump, Republicans in Congress, and the far right media, to name just a few.
Hank can only stand up to these bad actors and special interests because of support from grassroots supporters like YOU — will you chip in to help him keep fighting?
Thank you!

You read that right —
A sitting United States Senator…
In the year 2020…
Amidst a nationwide reckoning over our fraught history with racial injustice…
Outrageously claimed that slavery was a “necessary evil.” We’re at a loss for words.
Hank has come across some bad apples throughout his time in Congress, but Senator Tom Cotton may have taken the crown with these egregious comments. Will you chip in to support Hank so he can keep standing up to Tom Cotton and holding him accountable for his hideous words?
HOLD TOM COTTON ACCOUNTABLE
Alex, let’s be clear — slavery was a crime against humanity that will forever be a stain on our nation’s legacy, not a “necessity” as Senator Cotton suggests.
Not only is Tom Cotton on the wrong side of history with his comments, he’s thoroughly tone-deaf to the discussions of racial justice happening across the country. After all, an op-ed that he penned had to be pulled by the New York Times after he called for the military to send in the troops to quell peaceful protests.
Now normally, we’d highlight Tom Cotton’s opponent and do everything we can to help send him back home to Arkansas. But without a credible challenger in his election, Tom Cotton is staying in Washington — and that means it’s up to leaders like Hank to hold him accountable.
Tom Cotton’s gross simplification and diminishment of the sin of slavery isn’t just wrong — it’s dangerous. And he must be held accountable. Will you chip in to support Hank’s work to do just that?

Now it's been a few days since President Trump’s January 2nd airstrike on Qasem Soleimani, it has become plainly clear that this attack was ill-conceived and has made everyday Americans less safe.
This reckless move — made without consultation with Congress or support from our allies abroad — has already had chaotic consequences. Iran has announced that they will be enriching more uranium in violation of the 2015 nuclear agreement, the Iraqi Parliament has taken steps to expel American troops from their country, and Iran has threatened to strike back at US military targets.
And the aftermath of this situation has been made worse by Donald Trump’s continued erratic behavior. Trump has threatened Iran with violent war crimes, and refused to communicate with Congressional leaders — proclaiming on Twitter that his bizarre tweets serve as “notification to the United States Congress.”
I want to boost some additional digital ads calling out Donald Trump for this reckless, dangerous behavior, but we need to expand our advertising budget. Will you chip $10, $20 or whatever you can so we can make sure voters across Georgia and the country are up to speed on this situation?
CONTRIBUTE NOW
Alex -- the foreign policy of this administration has been an abject failure. From withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords to throwing the 2015 nuclear agreement in the trash, our moves on the world stage these past three years have had more to do with Donald Trump’s personal insecurities than this country’s national security.
If we’re going to win in 2020, we have to make sure everyday Georgians know about Trump’s disastrous foreign policy record. Will you make a contribution to my campaign today so we can add additional digital advertisements that educate voters on this President’s reckless conduct abroad?
Thank you,

Did you see the news? Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser, was arrested and charged with FRAUD for the “Build the Wall” GoFundMe scam.
This is just another example of Trump’s corruption and how he has surrounded himself with crooks and criminals -- and their behavior is all enabled by the rogue Attorney General, Bill Barr.
While Trump calls himself the president of “law and order”, it’s clear that he and his cronies believe they’re above the law. We cannot afford four more years of criminal activity in the White House, and we can’t afford to have any enablers of this behavior in Congress.
I’m running for re-election to stand up against this lawlessness. Could you send over a donation to my campaign so I can keep fighting in Congress to hold all of these people and their enablers accountable for their crimes?
DONATE NOW >>
It is truly disturbing how many Trump associates have been arrested, charged and found guilty of crimes -- from Paul Manafort to Rick Gates, Michael Flynn and now Steve Bannon? And somehow they all seem to be getting sweetheart deals courtesy of AG William Barr... We must defeat this corruption and bring decency back.
I’m appalled that people so close to the White House and president have been involved in so many criminal activities. This is insulting to the office of the president, and insulting to the people of America who want leaders that surround themselves with good, decent people.
We have choices to make when it comes to the leaders we want to represent us in Congress, and in the White House. Having criminals in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue who are enriching themselves for personal gain or lying to cover up the president’s crimes cannot stand.
Please make a contribution to my campaign today if you can -- every dollar counts and will help re-elect me to represent Georgia’s 4th district once again, and I couldn’t be prouder to stand with you and against this corruption.

Subject: Team, our freedom is at stake:
To: Carole Mumford
Hi everyone. I’m finding it increasingly difficult to deny that our nation is in the grip of a slow-moving coup d’etat and that our very freedom is at stake. Let me get you up to speed:
President Trump took the Presidency after encouraging, then accepting and benefiting from Russian interference in the 2016 election. Roger Stone was intimately involved in that collusion. So was Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort. Today they are all convicted felons.
As you may remember, these criminal associates were only brought to justice because former Attorney General Jeff Sessions lied about his own Russian contacts. So he recused himself from the investigation and appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Putin’s scheme to help Trump steal the election. President Trump was always furious about this decision, and wanted a new Attorney General who would kowtow to his corrupt demands. Well, when he appointed William Barr he got his man.
* AG Barr withheld the Mueller report from Congress while misstating its conclusions in a successful effort to mislead the public.
* AG Barr disparaged and cast doubt on a Office of Inspector General (OIG) report that claimed there were sufficient grounds to investigate the Trump campaign.
* AG Barr downplayed the impact Russia had on the election, saying that the FBI under President Obama was a greater threat than Russian inference.
And now, dear friends, it’s getting even worse. It is clear that every time President Trump gets away with a crime, he becomes emboldened and commits an even more egregious one. For example:
* The day after Mueller's testimony before the House Judiciary Committee about his report, President Trump made the “perfect” phone call to President Zelensky seeking Ukrainian assistance to help him get re-elected, using $391 million in desperately needed security assistance as leverage to force Ukrainian compliance with his demands.
* And now, after being acquitted by the Senate in a sham “trial” rigged by Moscow Mitch, Donald Trump is taking a “victory lap” by purging all those witnesses who dared stand against him and is trying to free cronies like Roger Stone and Michael Flynn.
Through all of this, AG William Barr has been subverting justice to help Donald Trump every step of the way. Barr is using his position to help shield Stone and Flynn from their just punishment -- to public applause from the President!
If Barr gets away with helping Trump’s friends, he will use his position to punish Trump’s enemies for exercising their constitutional rights. Our very freedom, my brothers and sisters, is under attack!
That’s why I am renewing calls for everyday Americans to sign on to my petition demanding that AG Barr resign. It’s clear this is going to be a long fight, but the more grassroots supporters I have by my side the harder I can fight for justice. If you haven’t signed, will you step up for our democracy today and add your name?
SIGN NOW >>
Thank you for continued vigilance on this crucial issue, team. I’m going to keep fighting to the high heavens to protect our Republic, and I’m heartened to have your support.
In solidarity,
Hank

192,"Alex -- did you see Hank’s appearance on MSNBC?
As an impeachment manager in the trial for federal Judge Thomas Porteous in 2010, Hank was able to give special insight into the process going on in the Senate right now. If you haven’t seen it, watch here →
The impeachment trial that Hank managed actually bears some resemblance to the current trial of President Trump. Judge Porteous, like President Trump, hadn’t been convicted of any crime and claimed that his misdeeds didn’t rise to the level of impeachment.
But he was still removed from office in an overwhelming vote. The same standard should be held to President Trump, and it’s up to us to make that happen. Will you chip in a grassroots donation so Hank can keep speaking truth to power and holding Trump accountable?
Thanks!

The President of the United States has run a concentrated campaign to get his buddy Michael Flynn off the hook for lying to the Federal Bureau of Intelligence (FBI) about conversations he had with Russian government officials -- and unfortunately, as of yesterday, it worked.
The Department of Justice (or should I say, the Department of Injustice) announced their intentions to drop all charges against Michael Flynn.
(This isn’t the first time that Donald Trump has meddled in the legal system for his political pals -- he managed to get his friend Roger Stone a reduced sentence after public lobbying as well.)
Alex -- Let me be clear: this is a disgrace. It is a disgrace that someone who pleaded guilty -- someone who admitted they committed the crime -- to providing false information to the FBI about his conversations with a foreign power has gotten off scot free because they are cronies of the President.
And Attorney General William Barr has been aiding and abetting Donald Trump every step of the way. When questioned about why someone who pleaded guilty was being let off the hook, Barr went on CBS News to say that “people sometimes plead to things that turn out not to be crimes” \-- it makes absolutely no sense.
Will you join me in standing up to this Department of Injustice, Alex? Will you sign my petition demanding that William Barr resign and that integrity get restored to our Justice Department? We’ve gotten thousands of signatures on past petitions calling on Barr to resign, but this new offense requires reinvigorated grassroots action to DEMAND change.
It is clear that integrity does not come naturally to this administration, so we must join together to demand it.
In solidarity,
Hank

194,"Alex,
Today is a special day set aside to give recognition to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. — and truthfully, this is a particularly important year to reflect on Dr. King’s movement and legacy.
These are perilous times. The most powerful people in the land are willing to go to unprecedented lengths to maintain their grip on power, and to cover up their crimes when they get caught. But even in our darkest moments, Dr. King reminded us that the dawn will come.
That doesn’t mean we can be complacent, Alex. Unlike the dawn, the change won’t come on its own.
In Dr. King’s final speech, he discussed the story of the Good Samaritan. So it goes, a traveler gets robbed and left injured on the side of the road, and countless people then pass by without lending a hand. Dr. King considers all the reasons that those people may have had for walking past, all the logical reasons they may have had not to act, summarizing those explanations in the fearful question: “If I stop to help this man, what will happen to me?""
Dr. King then explains: “But then the Good Samaritan came by, and he reversed the question. ‘If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him?’""
To live up to Dr. King’s legacy, we must look at our country’s challenges through this lens he presented in his last speech.
We must complete the census. We must register voters. We must do service work in our communities. We must stay engaged in the political process even when it is stressful and frustrating.
Why? Because if we do not, what will happen to our country?
So I encourage all of you to stay hopeful, optimistic, and engaged. And step-by-step we will continue to bend the arc of this nation closer to the dream that Martin Luther King Jr. shared with all of us.
Yours,
Hank

Team,
Now that it's been a few days since President Trump’s January 2nd airstrike on Qasem Soleimani, it has become plainly clear that this attack was ill-conceived and has made everyday Americans less safe.
This reckless move — made without consultation with Congress or support from our allies abroad — has already had chaotic consequences. Iran has announced that they will be enriching more uranium in violation of the 2015 nuclear agreement, the Iraqi Parliament has taken steps to expel American troops from their country, and Iran has threatened to strike back at US military targets.
And the aftermath of this situation has been made worse by Donald Trump’s continued erratic behavior. Trump has threatened Iran with violent war crimes, and refused to communicate with Congressional leaders — proclaiming on Twitter that his bizarre tweets serve as “notification to the United States Congress.”
I want to boost some additional digital ads calling out Donald Trump for this reckless, dangerous behavior, but we need to expand our advertising budget. Will you chip $10, $20 or whatever you can so we can make sure voters across Georgia and the country are up to speed on this situation?
CONTRIBUTE NOW
Folks -- the foreign policy of this administration has been an abject failure. From withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords to throwing the 2015 nuclear agreement in the trash, our moves on the world stage these past three years have had more to do with Donald Trump’s personal insecurities than this country’s national security.
If we’re going to win in 2020, we have to make sure everyday Georgians know about Trump’s disastrous foreign policy record. Will you make a contribution to my campaign today so we can add additional digital advertisements that educate voters on this President’s reckless conduct abroad?
Thank you,

196,"Alex — Did you hear about the fiery confrontation that happened on the steps of the U.S. Capitol?
AOC accosted by GOP lawmaker: The Hill
Trump lackey Rep. Ted Yoho tried to bully Rep. Ocasio-Cortez in a sexist, profanity-laced tirade.
He even got up in her face and wagged his pudgy finger and called her “disgusting” and “rude.” The irony is not lost on us.
Alex, as Americans, we will often disagree. Members of Congress have a responsibility to the citizens we serve to find consensus, and when we do disagree, to treat each other with dignity and respect. But what Rep. Yoho said crossed the line — using vile language to attack the young Congresswoman (that we choose not to dignify by repeating), as well as calling her “disgusting” and “out of her freaking mind.”
This was a shameful display of disrespect against one of his own colleagues, and he’s yet to properly and directly address his wrongs. Will you join us in condemning this atrocious behavior and demanding Rep. Yoho apologize?
CONDEMN TED YOHO’S REMARKS
This isn’t the first time colleagues in Congress have disagreed on the issues. In fact, there’s plenty of civil disagreement when people care so passionately about the policies at hand. Rep. Yoho’s response came from a place of deep disrespect for the young Latina Congresswoman — it was inappropriate, dehumanizing and has no place in these hallowed halls of Congress.
Looking at the record, it seems like Mr. Yoho has some priorities to straighten out that might be a better use of his time than cursing out a sitting Congresswoman. After all, he was one of the four members of the House to vote AGAINST anti-lynching bill named in Emmet Till’s memory.
He voted down the bill that would make lynching a federal hate crime because it was an, “overreach of the federal government and tramples on states rights.” Hmm, where have we heard that before?
Rep. Ted Yoho has got a lot to work on, the easiest of which is crafting a meaningful and impactful apology to AOC. Will you condemn his abhorrent remarks alongside Hank and other Congressional Democrats and demand an apology by adding your name?

197,"Hi Alex. I’m finding it increasingly difficult to deny that our nation is in the grip of a slow-moving coup d’etat and that our very freedom is at stake. Let me get you up to speed:
President Trump took the Presidency after encouraging, then accepting and benefiting from Russian interference in the 2016 election. Roger Stone was intimately involved in that collusion. So was Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort. Today they are all convicted felons.
As you may remember, these criminal associates were only brought to justice because former Attorney General Jeff Sessions lied about his own Russian contacts. So he recused himself from the investigation and appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Putin’s scheme to help Trump steal the election. President Trump was always furious about this decision, and wanted a new Attorney General who would kowtow to his corrupt demands. Well, when he appointed William Barr he got his man.
* AG Barr withheld the Mueller report from Congress while misstating its conclusions in a successful effort to mislead the public.
* AG Barr disparaged and cast doubt on a Office of Inspector General (OIG) report that claimed there were sufficient grounds to investigate the Trump campaign.
* AG Barr downplayed the impact Russia had on the election, saying that the FBI under President Obama was a greater threat than Russian inference.
And now, Alex, it’s getting even worse. It is clear that every time President Trump gets away with a crime, he becomes emboldened and commits an even more egregious one. For example:
* The day after Mueller's testimony before the House Judiciary Committee about his report, President Trump made the “perfect” phone call to President Zelensky seeking Ukrainian assistance to help him get re-elected, using $391 million in desperately needed security assistance as leverage to force Ukrainian compliance with his demands.
* And now, after being acquitted by the Senate in a sham “trial” rigged by Moscow Mitch, Donald Trump is taking a “victory lap” by purging all those witnesses who dared stand against him and is trying to free cronies like Roger Stone and Michael Flynn.
Through all of this, AG William Barr has been subverting justice to help Donald Trump every step of the way. Barr is using his position to help shield Stone and Flynn from their just punishment -- to public applause from the President!
If Barr gets away with helping Trump’s friends, he will use his position to punish Trump’s enemies for exercising their constitutional rights. Our very freedom, my brothers and sisters, is under attack!
That’s why I am renewing calls for everyday Americans to sign on to my petition demanding that AG Barr resign. It’s clear this is going to be a long fight, but the more grassroots supporters I have by my side the harder I can fight for justice. If you haven’t signed, will you step up for our democracy today and add your name?

198,"Alex -- This is a total trashing of the rule of law:
Late last night, President Trump announced that he was commuting Roger Stone’s sentence and that Mr. Stone would not face a single day of jail time.
Roger Stone lied to Congress to protect Donald Trump. Now, Donald Trump is using his powers as President of the United States to keep his dirty trickster out of prison.
Will you stand with us to fight back and defend our rule of law? >>
When peaceful protestors are in the streets demanding racial equality, Donald Trump rants and raves about “law and order,” but when his buddies are found guilty of serious crimes, apparently “law and order” doesn’t apply.
As if there were still any doubt, this crooked kickback proves that the rule of law of this country will never apply to this so-called President.
But while Donald Trump is the perpetrator of this particular graft, he is not the only one who is guilty.
Congressional Republicans had their chance to stop Donald Trump’s corruption by convicting him and removing him from office during impeachment hearings this year. Every single one of them, with the exception of Senator Romney, failed in their duty.
They have enabled and allowed abuses like the commutation of Roger Stone to take place. And so it’s up to us to send the message that nobody is above the law. Not Donald Trump. Not Roger Stone. Nobody.
Will you chip in a contribution so Congressional Democrats like Rep. Hank Johnson can hold Trump and his cronies accountable for their corruption?

NOW: The Lake County Board of Elections has confirmed that the GOP’s claim is 100% FALSE and Hillary didn’t vote in Ohio for the 2008 election. But we haven’t seen a retraction or an apology, so it’s safe to say they’re sticking to their guns on this lie.

Steve Chabot for Congress
Friend,
I’m sure you’ve heard by now, but early this morning, Nancy Pelosi made a surprise announcement that radical Democrats in Washington will move forward with impeaching our president.
Pelosi has taken the left’s impeachment hysteria to a new level, officially recommending that the House introduce articles of impeachment…
Pelosi claims her decision was based on “facts,” but as someone who participated in yesterday’s Judiciary Committee hearing, I can tell you with complete certainty: the Democrats’ arguments are VOID of facts.
I am fighting hard to defend our president and I need you by my side.
The Democrats’ impeachment agenda has officially crossed a line.
By moving to recommend articles of impeachment based on nothing but a desire to undo the results of the 2016 election, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff are abusing a power reserved in our Constitution for the most serious of crimes.
It’s up to us to send a message loud and clear that we DO NOT SUPPORT their politically-motivated witch hunt, and that WE HAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP’S BACK!
I WILL DEFEND PRESIDENT TRUMP
I DO NOT SUPPORT IMPEACHMENT
Think about what this means for the future of our country. We can’t allow impeachment to become the go-to weapon to remove someone we dislike from office.
As I said yesterday, President Trump is going to serve out his term and be elected to another one. But to get there, he needs your help to beat this shameful impeachment effort: [[URL REDACTED]]
Will you join me in defending President Trump?

## Chabot: Choose prosperity over dangerous policies
Steve Chabot, Opinion contributor
[[URL REDACTED]], October 31 2020
By any measure, 2020 has been a challenging year for everyone – not just here, but across the globe. But, as Americans always do, we’re finding ways to persevere, even in the face of unprecedented obstacles.
No challenge has been greater than the COVID-19 pandemic. Faced with a novel virus we didn’t even know existed a year ago, we had to act quickly to find a way to slow the spread of the virus.
Significant portions of our economy were shut down to deal with the virus’ initial onslaught, and give medical professionals time to learn more about treating it. Those critical efforts likely saved hundreds of thousands of lives.
But the economic impact of the pandemic required swift action from Congress to help the American people survive this unprecedented period in our history. Fortunately, we acted quickly, and in a bipartisan manner, to enact three major pieces of legislation to: increase testing capacity; provide health care providers the resources they needed to treat patients and protect their staffs; send billions to local governments to help them confront the virus; and provide relief directly to the American people.
As the top Republican on the House Small Business Committee, I worked closely with Democratic Chairwoman Nydia Velazquez from New York, and our Senate counterparts, to help small businesses survive the pandemic. The result, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), has helped save millions of jobs across the country. In the 1st Congressional District, more small businesses received loans (over 17,000) for more money (nearly $3 billion), and most importantly, we saved more jobs (256,000) than any other district in Ohio.
The program’s been extremely successful, but our small businesses need additional support. That’s why I’ve been pushing to reopen the program, place a greater emphasis on the smallest of small businesses, and allow a second loan to those businesses still struggling to survive. It is why I’ve visited more then 70 small businesses in recent weeks, to listen to their concerns, learn how we can improve the PPP program and see what else I can do to help. Especially, with the recent surge in COVID-19 cases, we need to make sure small business owners have the support they need to make it through this crisis.
The good news is the economy is rebounding. Millions of jobs lost early in the pandemic have come back, and the economy grew by a robust 7.4% in the third quarter. We still have a ways to go, but we’re exceeding many expectations as we rebuild from the initial shock of the pandemic.
Obviously, the other major challenge we face is improving police-community relations following the inexcusable and horrific death of George Floyd in Minnesota. In response, I introduced common-sense reforms to improve police-community relations, help weed out any bad apples in the police force, and make our neighborhoods safer.
That’s why I’ve been endorsed by the Cincinnati Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), and the Democratic Sheriff of Hamilton County, Jim Neil. They know I’ll work with both police, and community leaders, to make sure our neighborhoods are safe, and every citizen, regardless of race or ethnicity, is treated with respect by the police.
My opponent, on the other hand, would make our neighborhoods less safe. She refused to condemn efforts to defund our police, would get rid of cash bail, and she’d allow police officers to be sued for simply doing their jobs.
Further, she hampered our COVID-19 response by running up a $2.7 million deficit at the Cincinnati Board of Health and embroiled the board in an ""unethical"" hiring scandal.
And she’d crush our economy by supporting the radical Green New Deal, which would cost $93 trillion, kill millions of American jobs, and even pay people who refuse to work. Shockingly, she has repeatedly declared that ""nothing else matters"" – even as our communities battle a pandemic.
And so in this election, the choice is clear. We can choose my opponent’s dangerous agenda, and head down the path towards higher taxes, job-killing socialist programs, and more crime in our communities.
Or we can focus on defeating COVID-19, continuing to restore American prosperity, standing up for our small businesses and making our communities safer for every family. If you agree these should be our priorities and that our elected leaders should focus on delivering results for you, I’d appreciate your vote.

Hi Friend,
FOX News has been a steadfast supporter of the President, often sharing White House propaganda and criticism of the impeachment proceedings from the very beginning.
But their Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano, has made it clear the case against Trump is both legal and credible.
“It leaves us with valid, lawful, constitutional arguments for Trump's impeachment that he ought to take seriously. That is, unless he knows he will be acquitted because Republican senators have told him so. Whoever may have whispered that into his ear is unworthy of sitting as a juror and has violated the oath of ""impartial justice"" and fidelity to the Constitution and the law.
What is required for removal of the president? A demonstration of presidential commission of high crimes and misdemeanors, of which in Trump's case the evidence is ample and uncontradicted.”
As more and more evidence continues to come forward about Trump’s crimes it becomes harder and harder for his supporters to ignore. At the same time, our campaign is gaining steam. But we can’t keep moving forward without money, even though we’ve done a whole lot with just a little. Help us continue to make an impact by making a donation today.

Joe has spent more time in Iowa connecting with voters than any other Republican candidate, and it’s clear people are tiring of Trump’s behavior, the GOP’s blatant lying to cover for him, and the continued disregard for our Constitution.
Let’s stand together for what’s right, because now more than ever, truth and principles matter. It’s time to be brave.

206,"Hi Friend — over the weekend, we were reminded once again why Donald Trump is completely unfit to be president. In a barrage of unhinged and deeply troublesome tweets, he claimed that he no longer needs the approval of the U.S. Congress to go to war.
Even worse, he made it clear that he intends to commit war crimes in his reckless escalation of the situation in Iran.
Joe had to speak up — and he did. Here's a sample of what he had to say:
### Joe on CNN Newsroom With Fredricka Whitfield
""He's unfit. Every [[URL REDACTED]] needs to be really scared right now. And the reason they ought to be really scared right now is because of who is in the White House...
[[URL REDACTED]] have a guy in the White House who doesn't read. He doesn't think. He doesn't understand. He doesn't listen, He doesn't take advice. He puts his own interests ahead of the nation's interest and he doesn't tell the truth...

Hi Friend,
The unstoppable and overwhelming tide of evidence of Trump’s crimes continues to flow in. It must be terrible for Trump’s defenders to constantly have to look like fools as their lies are exposed on a daily basis. The latest revelation comes from Trump’s former advisor, John Bolton, who says he was told by the President that the military aid funds for Ukraine were being held until their country helped him gather and manufacture dirt on his political opponent.
Trump’s crimes are now confirmed by his inner circle.
But this new information didn’t come forward because of the impeachment trial going on in the Senate. Bolton hasn’t been called as a witness by the Senate because so far the GOP has blocked the idea of hearing from witnesses or looking at new evidence.
No, this deeply disturbing evidence of Trump abusing the powers of his office to bribe a foreign country to meddle in our elections on his behalf came because a draft of a book authored by Bolton was leaked.
It’s not right that John Bolton’s book publishers know more than United States Senators know during one of the most important moments in American political history. The Senators have the power to examine more evidence, to hear more accounts, but the GOP has fallen on their knees for Trump and they don’t want to face his crimes. But they should know that even if they acquit him in the Senate, it won’t stop the long march of truth from continuing to pour out. They will be on the wrong side of history and their legacy will be one of destroying a Party.
IT'S CLEAR THAT TRUMP IS GUILTY

Hi Friend,
It was hard to miss Donald Trump’s unhinged tweetstorm last week, when he gave a bullhorn to sick conspiracy theorists and vile hatemongers, put the Ukraine whistleblower’s life in danger by tweeting their rumored name, and publicly needled Nancy Pelosi like a tween who wanted some attention from their crush.
I won’t repeat the nonsense he spewed but, even for Trump, it was out there. As if it weren’t clear before, he’s become wholly detached from reality and is so desperate that he’ll do anything to divert attention away from the crimes he was impeached — and should be removed from office — for.
He’s hiding something — and the article released by The New York Times last night gave us a good idea what it is: nearly everyone around him knew why he was trying to muscle Ukraine into meddling in our elections and practically begged him not to do it, while others more willing to do his bidding simply played along with the shadow government he put in place to make it happen.
Not only is this grounds for impeachment and removal from office, but it’s borderline treasonous for an American president to behave this way. He’s unfit, he’s unwell, and he’s working to destroy this country.
But we can do something about it, Friend, and we don’t need to rely on the Senate. We can use the tool that is the centerpiece of our democracy — our vote.

209,"Dear Friend,
Today, Donald Trump tweeted to the world that he no longer needs the approval of the United States Congress to go to war.
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter, “These Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target, the United States will quickly & fully strike back, & perhaps in a disproportionate manner. Such legal notice is not required, but it is given nonetheless!”
The President is engaging in war crimes — plain and simple. He knows he needs the approval of Congress to initiate any significant military action our country takes! We are now alone with no allies to defend us for the actions HE has taken by killing Iran’s second-in-command.
We cannot let this happen anymore. Donald Trump must not be the face of the GOP, let alone the United Stares. As I said on CNN just a short time ago, whether he is impeached or beaten in the race for the GOP nomination, his actions are escalating events that cannot be stopped.
Please help me by donating to our campaign so we can stop the madman in the White House.

Councilman/Retired USMC Colonel Greg Raths
Votes to Fully Fund Mission Viejo Police Services
Mission Viejo Council Unanimously Votes for Police Services Contract
Orange County, CA (June 11, 2020) – Colonel Greg Raths, USMC (Ret.), a Mission Viejo Councilman, joined with his Council colleagues to approve the city’s FY 2020-21 $20.1 million contract for police services with the Orange County Sheriff’s Department. The contract adds patrols to Mission Viejo schools to protect students, teachers, and school staff.
Raths made the following statement:
“There is no question that George Floyd was murdered by Derek Chauvin, and the other three Minneapolis officers were complicit in this murder. Floyd did not deserve to be killed and certainly not in such brutal fashion. When I was in the United States Marine Corps, the Uniform Code of Military Justice was swift and fair because we knew the importance of punishing and stopping those who abused the awesome power entrusted to us by the American people.
“That being said, calls to defund the police are an overreaction by extremists in our country. The vast majority of police officers and sheriff’s deputies are noble public servants who put their lives on the line to protect the public from criminals and assist people in need of help. We should honor their brave service. We need to make sure our law enforcement have the resources they need to protect our community from crime and to serve our law-abiding residents.
“It is important to encourage innovative and community-based policing, which strengthens the relationship between law enforcement and the community. Defunding discourages innovation. In Mission Viejo, our newest Sheriff’s Department contract adds patrols to our schools to ensure that students, teachers, and staff are safer at school, and students are able to have positive interactions with Sheriff’s deputies. Recognizing the changing needs of our community, the council voted to retain a homeless liaison deputy who has special training on mental illness and will work to connect the homeless with services and resources.”
Colonel Greg Raths, USMC (Ret.) is serving his second term on the Mission Viejo City Council and is the former Mayor. A combat decorated fighter pilot, Greg flew 75 combat missions in Iraq, Kuwait, and Somalia flying the F/A-18 Hornet. He was later selected to serve in the prestigious White House Military Office as Chief of Staff. After retiring from the Marine Corps in 2004, he flew for Jet Blue Airways as a commercial airline pilot, and then went into business as president of an Orange County company. Greg currently serves as president of the Mission Viejo Rotary Club. He is the Vice Chairman of the Orange County Veterans Advisory Council.
Greg earned his master’s degree from National Defense University, bachelor’s degrees from Arizona State University and Cal State Fullerton, and associate’s degrees from Saddleback College and Phoenix College. Greg moved to Orange County in 1977 when he was assigned to the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. Married since 1982, Greg and Luci have three children and six grandchildren.

Crime Survivors PAC for California’s 45th Congressional District
Orange County, CA (June 30, 2020) – Colonel Greg Raths, USMC (Ret.), a Mission Viejo Councilman, has received the endorsement of Crime Survivors PAC. He is the Republican nominee for the House of Representatives against freshman incumbent Representative Katie Porter (D-Irvine), who is endorsed by none of the mayors in the 45th District.

“As a retired U.S. Marine Colonel and decorated veteran, Greg Raths has demonstrated unparalleled experience in being a leader dedicated to American safety,” said Patricia Wenskunas, Founder and CEO of Crime Survivors, Inc. “The devotion that Raths has shown to the well-being of Orange County locals as both Mayor and City Council Member of Mission Viejo helped lead to a 27% reduction in crime.”
“I believe Orange County needs a leader like Greg Raths who puts an emphasis on the importance of keeping our cities a safe place to raise a family and thrive,” continued Wenskunas. “My gratitude for a principled and personable candidate like Greg Raths is immense and I fully endorse him in the race for California’s 45th Congressional District.”
“It is an honor to be endorsed by Patricia Wenskunas and Crime Survivors PAC, who are such strong advocates for standing up to criminals and standing up for the rights of crime victims,” said Raths. “I am grateful that they have recognized my record in protecting law-abiding citizens against harm by dangerous criminals.”

We only have 44 days until ballots are mailed out and voting starts.
It’s me vs. Derek Kilmer vs. 4 Republicans.
Can you give $4.40 now to help me win 44 days from now?
Now more than ever, we need progressive policies. It took my Democratic opponent, Derek Kilmer, a week to say anything about the murder of George Floyd. He did, finally: 4 hours after I publicly called him out for it on Twitter and in a live interview. It is a sad state of affairs that even one of the Republican candidates came out saying Floyd’s murderers needed to be arrested before Democrat Kilmer did.
The ongoing murder of Black Americans by the police is proof that we need comprehensive reform of the police, including greatly reducing their funding, demilitarizing the police, and instituting community control of the police.
We also need to ban private prisons, as well as civil asset forfeiture, which lets police seize and keep any property they allege (without proof) is involved in a crime.
I am the only candidate in the race who stands for all these policies.
If you’re able to, can you donate now to help me win this race and fight for these reforms in Congress? Ballots drop in only 44 days, and any amount you can give helps.

Roger Stone is a longtime political fixer who committed criminal behavior when he lied to Congress to protect President Trump and his wrongdoings during the 2016 election.

Friend,
The National Organization for Women (NOW) is proud to endorse Jerry Nadler because he has spent his entire career fighting for women’s rights.
Even when it’s hard, we can always count on Jerry to defend women’s access to the full range of reproductive health services and fight right-wing efforts to deny women their fundamental freedom and autonomy.
In times like this, with Republicans becoming more and more extreme, knowing Jerry will advocate for what’s right is so important.

Beyond his impressive voting record, Jerry also has been at the forefront of structural reform that expands the rights of women and fights structural sexism in all of its forms.
Last year, he introduced a bill ensuring pregnant women are afforded protection against workplace discrimination and led hearings to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.
Instead of simply relying on what had been done, Jerry pushed hard to ensure the new version included steps to strengthen legal protections for the LGBTQ+, Native Americans, and immigrant women.
He also worked to make it harder for people convicted of domestic violence crimes to acquire firearms and expanded grant funding for training and prevention programs.
We are proud to support Jerry Nadler as a champion for women’s rights. Join us by rushing a donation now!
Supporting women shouldn’t be a partisan issue, but all too often it is.
Republicans know their extreme base cares more about imposing their personal morality on the rest of us than actually upholding Constitutionally guaranteed freedoms. That’s why it’s important that we defend champions of women’s rights like Jerry.
Thank you for supporting women,

Attorney General William Barr, specifically, needs to be held accountable.
From openly lying about the contents of the Mueller Report, to ordering police to attack peaceful protesters so Trump could get a photo opportunity, to his most recent decision to push for the removal of a New York Attorney who was actively investigating the Trump administration, AG Barr has undermined the rule of law.
Unfortunately, Senate Republicans have been complicit in this corruption and are unpatriotically blocking any attempt to hold the Trump administration accountable.
Add your name here to demand that Senate Republicans stop betraying America and start doing their job to hold the Trump administration accountable for its many crimes against the Constitution. ADD YOUR NAME
I promise to continue to do everything in my power to uphold the rule of law.

222,"Trump Commutes Sentence of Roger Stone, NYTimes
President Trump undermined the rule of law in America yet again by commuting the sentence of his campaign henchman Roger Stone.
To protect Donald Trump, Roger Stone threatened to harm witnesses to his crimes, lied to investigators, and was found guilty of obstruction of justice.
Therefore, what President Trump is doing is commuting the sentence of a man who obstructed justice to avoid exposing Trump’s crimes. This is a clear abuse of power, and all Americans need to speak up.
Sign here to join me in demanding answers from President Trump on why he abused the power of the presidency by commuting the sentence of Roger Stone! Defend the Rule of Law
No president has ever used this power so blatantly to reward a lackey for covering up their crimes. Trump’s decision will do ever further and lasting damage to public trust in our justice system.
That’s why, as Chair of the Judiciary Committee, I’m demanding an immediate briefing from the White House Counsel regarding President Trump’s decision to commute Roger Stone’s sentence.
Additionally, I’m calling on the Department of Justice to release all grand jury materials related to Roger Stone’s dealings with President Trump.

Our polls show this race a dead heat.
Nicole has been a reliable and consistent voice against the far left policies being pushed by Mayor de Blasio, Governor Cuomo and members of Congress like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
That’s why we need Nicole to win this race to keep fighting and hold the left accountable. Chip in $5, $10 or any amount today to help us win.
HELP US WIN
Nicole has a record of accomplishment:
* She successfully pushed back against Mayor de Blasio’s attempts to dismantle specialized high schools and gifted & talented programs.
* She wrote to the US Justice Department to stop left wing politicians’ attempts to open heroin injection centers.
* She got the Mayor to form a property tax commission whose recommendations will benefit middle class homeowners.
* She convinced Mayor de Blasio to alter NYC’s sanctuary policy and deport those who commit sex crimes.
* She is leading the fight to fix Cuomo’s dangerous bail law.
Nicole is giving up her seat in the state legislature to run for Congress this November. She must win or we will lose one of our best advocates for common sense.
If you agree that we need Nicole to continue fighting for us and hold the left accountable, chip in $5, $10 or any amount today.

The last thing Bill de Blasio wants is Nicole Malliotakis in Congress.
Why? Nicole has been one of the few elected officials in New York City to hold Mayor de Blasio accountable. She:
✅ Stopped de Blasio’s attempt to bring heroin injection centers to NYC
✅ Got de Blasio to deport illegal immigrants who commit sex crimes
✅ Pushed de Blasio to establish a property tax commission currently underway
✅ Voted against tax increases 336 times
✅ Opposed closing Rikers Island and led the fight to fix the disastrous bail reform putting criminals back on the street
✅ Is fighting to reopen our city’s economy
The list goes on. We can count on Nicole to stand up to Bill de Blasio, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the socialist squad in Congress!
At Sunday’s “Save our City” rally, Nicole said it best: “Make no mistake... the anarchy, the lawlessness, the attacks on job creators, this is an attempt to bring socialism to our nation and we reject it.”

This is the result of dangerous policies put in place by radical politicians who have sent the message that there are no consequences for crime.
Liberals, including Max Rose, have put us all in danger by voting for or supporting policies like:
❌ Closing Rikers Island
❌ Releasing of convicted felons
❌ Eliminating bail for rioting, arson, robbery and assault
It is absolutely unacceptable for politicians like Max Rose to protect criminals instead of protecting our communities.
HELP DEFEAT MAX
And with some New York politicians defending this anarchy and calling to defund our police, someone had to speak up so I went on Fox News this morning to fight back!
Pandering to far left radicals and criminals must STOP. We need elected leaders who support law and order with their words, actions and votes!

232,"Friends- Over the weekend Bill de Blasio called the crime spike that has surged since the new no-bail policy took effect an “extraordinary jump”, and the Post called it a “crime surge”. Since January, New York City has seen a nearly 40% increase in shooting victims and a rise in most major crimes according to official NYPD statistics. Auto thefts have increased 70%. Talk about going back to the 1970s and 80s.

This dangerous no-bail policy is exactly the sort of radical agenda liberals are trying to bring to our entire country and to lock in to federal law. Bernie Sanders even said it in Friday’s debate. We CANNOT let that happen.
I need your help. We have to take back Congress \- and I cannot believe it has gotten even this far - to literally prevent dangerous criminals from being released into our communities.
Chip in $25, $50 or any amount to help us take back NY-11.

This isn’t some scare tactic. In New York City we’re actually just letting violent offenders walk free. We have to stop this terrible policy in its tracks and make sure it doesn’t spread.
I’m fighting back. I know you will too.

Even President Trump believes this seat will flip, citing the rise in crime and the tax burden on New Yorkers.

And while Max Rose was busy joining calls to defund the police, crime has surged in our city. Max Rose said a raise in his paycheck was a ‘drop in the bucket’ and yet Staten Islanders and southern Brooklynites are struggling to make ends meet.
Max Rose’s time is up.
It’s never been more crucial we elect a new voice to Congress who will stand up for Staten Island and southern Brooklyn.
We are in every position to take back this seat, but must have the resources to compete with Nancy Pelosi’s Money Machine and the dark money pouring into Max Rose’s campaign.

Friend-
Have you ever seen the movie The Purge? The one where all crime is legal for one night a year and violence runs rampant. It was scary when it was just a fictional movie, but now New York City is one big leap closer to making The Purge a reality.
Yesterday, wacko mayor Bill de Blasio announced he was caving to Max Rose and the other extreme leftists’ demand and cutting $1 billion from the NYPD budget.
That one billion dollars is enough to fund EVERY SINGLE POLICE OFFICER in my district and a handful of other districts.
Help us stop them before it's too late.
DEFUND DEMOCRATS
If this Max Rose/Bill de Blasio “defund the police” scheme actually happens we could be left without any police officers in all of Staten Island and Brooklyn.
Imagine picking up the phone, dialing 9-1-1, and hearing that you’re on your own because there are no more police officers. None.
If you think this type of thing could only happen in New York City and nowhere else, think again. Socialists are winning in cities across the country.
We have to take a stand, we have to stop these radical liberals before they succeed in implementing policies that release criminals onto our streets and eliminate the police officers who help keep our neighborhoods safe.
I’m fighting back, you know that. And I know you’re already with me, but we need to get the word out before it is too late. Forward this email to as many friends and family members as you can so we can get the word our and build support.
Then chip in $25, $50, or even $100 so we can keep pushing our message of safe neighborhoods and win in November before Max Rose and Bill de Blaiso completely destroy our city, state, and country.

Last week it was President Trump who called out Max Rose for being “a puppet of Pelosi.” This week it’s America’s Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

They see what we see...someone who promised to be independent, then went to Washington and voted 97% of the time with Pelosi to stimulus checks for illegal immigrants, amnesty to gang members and to impeach our President.
There’s another reason our Law and Order Mayor supports our Law and Order Candidate for Congress.
The disturbing reality is, Max Rose:
* Joined those calling to defund the NYPD
* Voted to release convicted felons
* Supported the disastrous bail reform
* And supports the closure of Rikers Island
While Nancy Pelosi’s Money Machine continues to bankroll Max Rose’s campaign, the NYPD budget was slashed, crime has spiked in NYC and Max Rose continues to say one thing in the district and do another in Washington.
It’s time we have a leader in Congress who will stand up to the socialist left that’s dividing our country and calling to dismantle the thin blue line protecting our community.
But I can’t do this without you.

The new state law giving driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants is causing massive problems for law enforcement, federal immigration officials and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Max Rose didn’t join with other members of New York’s Congressional Delegation to urge a U.S. Department of Justice review of the law’s constitutionality. This is shocking considering he sits on the Homeland Security committee.
The law has denied local law enforcement access to important information they need to solve crimes and it even requires the DMV to give illegal immigrants a heads up that federal agents are seeking them. It’s outrageous that elected officials are undermining our law enforcement by giving illegal immigrants with warrants a head start.

Friends-
Meet Kamala Harris - the anti-cop, pro-gang power-hungry danger who loves putting people in jail for political gain but goes easy on people who are a threat to the community. I’ll let the headlines and articles speak for themselves and you’ll see the true Kamala Harris.
SF Chronicle, April 14, 2004
D.A. won't pursue death in cop slaying
""San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris said Tuesday she will not seek the death penalty against a man accused of killing a San Francisco police officer over the weekend, a decision that legal experts say is rare if not unprecedented in California""
SF Gate, May 21, 2010
Judge rips Harris' office for hiding problems
""In a scathing ruling, the judge concluded that [Harris] had failed to fulfill their constitutional duty to tell defense attorneys about problems surrounding Deborah Madden, the now-retired technician at the heart of the cocaine-skimming scandal that led police to shut down the drug analysis section of their crime lab.""
If you think Kamala Harris withholding crucial evidence that could let innocent people out of jail all while going easy on gang members who kill cops isn’t bad enough (it is), let me show you in her own words what she thinks of the disastrous bail reform policies that have sent crime souring in New York City:
New York City is burning down thanks to Bill de Blasio and Max Rose’s awful bail boondoggle, but Kamala Harris wants to double down on the policy.
NO THANK YOU.

241,"Friend, Over 18,000 of you signed a petition and even more joined me in being vocal against the disastrous bail reform which took effect on January 1st and reduced our safety and increased crime in our city and state.
Friend,
As we continue to fight COVID-19, I want to make sure you are also aware of significant changes we achieved to New York’s dangerous bail reform while we were in Albany earlier this month.
Over 18,000 of you signed a petition and even more joined me in being vocal against the disastrous bail reform which took effect on January 1st and reduced our safety and increased crime in our city and state.
At the beginning of March, Nicole was invited on FOX & Friends to discuss the bail reform and fixes to the law getting closer.
WATCH NOW
Fixing the botched bail reform has been one of my top priorities and we’ve made progress under the one-party rule in Albany. After countless press conferences, community outrage, and pressure we put on Governor Cuomo and the Democrats, here’s what we achieved:
A large number of offenses were added to the list of ""qualifying offenses"" that are eligible for bail:
* Class A-I felony drug offenses;
* Sex trafficking;
* Money laundering in support of terrorism in the 3rd and 4th degrees;
* Strangulation
* Promoting a sexual performance by a child;
* Any crime that is alleged to cause the death of another person;
* Vehicular assault in the 1st degree;
SEE FULL LIST
The changes also fixed issues that district attorneys had with discovery reform and better protects victims and witnesses personal information.
It's been a long-fought battle, but we persisted and were able to achieve significant changes to the botched bail reform adopted by the governor with one-party rule in last year’s budget. Not only did we add a significant number of offenses to those that qualify for bail, we added provisions to stop ""unlimited chances"" by ensuring that a person who either commits a crime after being released on their own recognizance, is on probation or is on post release supervision will have to face a judge in court who will be able to set bail.
Appearing on Tucker Carlson Tonight in November 2019, Nicole brought national attention to New York's radical bail law and launched her petition.
WATCH NOW
I'm happy to have worked with the District Attorneys’ Association, police unions, my colleagues and the public to demand common-sense changes to protect public safety.
While more still needs to be done, this is a big step in the right direction. Thank you for your help in making these improvements a reality.

I’m doing everything I can to get the botched bail law that Governor Cuomo and the democrat-controlled state legislature passed in the middle of the night with the State Budget FIXED.
In just two weeks we saw:
* An unlicensed illegal immigrant released with no bail after admitting to a hit and run that killed a young mother of three;
* A woman with a criminal history arrested for assaulting two Jewish women released and rearrested two more times in a week;
* A man with 24 prior arrests released without bail after being charged with assault for punching a police officer;
* A man accused of stabbing a woman to death in Albany back in July released under the new law;
* A man charged with predatory sex assault, rape of child less than 13 released without bail;
* A man arrested in connection to four Manhattan bank robberies released without bail and is suspected of robbing a 5th bank the next day in Brooklyn;
* A homeless man arrested for 2 unprovoked attacks on women was arrested again — just a few hours after his release;
And most shocking...
* On Sunday, a repeated drunk driver with 12 prior convictions, drove drunk again and killed a young medical student. He was released with no bail again after just being released on January 1 following an arrest for not having a court-ordered ignition interlock device in his car.
We must stop this madness.
Governor Cuomo and the state legislators, and those like Mayor de Blasio, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Max Rose who supported this while we tried to stop it, must ALL be held accountable.
Even worse, Democrat Presidential candidates like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Michael Bloomberg similar bail reform for federal crimes.
If we end up with a president and member of congress like Max Rose, what is happening with New York’s disastrous bail reform can happen nationally.
We must be vigilant about who we elect. Check out what I had to say on Tucker Carlson and Fox & Friends about this disastrous reform:

245,"# Beyond the Podium | 10th Congressional District Candidate Tom Brier
In an interview with CBS 21 this week, Tom set himself apart from his opponents, explained the importance of bipartisanship for our country's future, told us who his political role model is, the best advice he has received, and much [[URL REDACTED]] can watch the full interview by clicking the image linked above or by reading a transcript of the interview below.
Time: 00:00
What sets you apart from your opponents?
Scott Perry, first. That’s the goal for both Eugene and I: we're running on a set of values to try to help people.
I mean the paradigmatic example of Perry is that in November of 2018 right before the election he published an Op-ed in the Patriot News where he promised to protect coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. When the pre-existing conditions coverage act came to a vote last year, he voted against it. That's his entire political approach. He's in there not for the people of the District. His record—whether it’s passing the $1.5 trillion tax cut, whether it’s the taking away of people's healthcare, and just having a general affinity for the wealthier in our country as opposed to the working-class — that's where Scott Perry really fails, and that's why we need a Democrat in office.
Between Eugene and me it comes down to really three basic things.
The first is in an era where government is broken, how can we fix it? Eugene’s taken corporate money his entire career: Pfizer, Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, PECO. If you go check out his reports, he's basically ran on getting corporate contributions. We’re not taking corporate money. If you want to talk about fixing the system and giving people a sense of participation in government, then you have to take away special interest, and so we're not taking corporate money and that is I think a prerequisite nowadays to run for office.
The second is climate change: it’s the most important issue of our time. Harrisburg has the second worst air quality in Pennsylvania, I think York is seventh, Pennsylvania’s in the top ten nationally for the worst carbon footprint. We signed the Green New Deal because President Trump has rolled back more than 90 environmental regulations, he backed out of the Paris Climate Accord, and we see what’s happening in Australia. We have a make-or-break moment right now to try and fix this. Eugene supports the expansion of fracking. That makes air quality worse, that compounds the problem. If we want to look to the future and actually give people a sense of hope that we can fix this, we can't afford it.
The last one is just having a real policy platform. Eugene doesn’t have any policy ideas on his website. I don’t know where he stands on any particular issue like healthcare, or climate change, or anything that voters are concerned about today. Whereas we put forth detailed policy proposals on pretty much everything out there today from healthcare to student loans to climate change. I think people know where we stand, and in an era where we need politicians who are courageous and candid, I think that's an important difference between the two of us.
Time: 2:46
If you were elected, what would you change?
How politicians interact with their constituents. We’ll do a Town Hall every quarter, I’ll go door-to-door if i’m elected, I will constantly try to be present in the community. Most folks today, oftentimes, don’t even know who their representatives are. They don’t hold Town Halls, they’re not interacting with people. One of the things I learned about when I wrote my book was this awesome movement in the 1830s called the American Lyceum movement. Towns across the country would invite Frederick Douglass, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Abraham Lincoln, to have these public forums. Women’s suffrage and abolition then became a part of public discourse. We don’t do that anymore. It’s coming back to the voters who hopefully give me a chance to represent them, telling them where I think I messed up, telling them where I think I succeeded, telling them where I think we have more work to do, and just having a constant interaction and conversation with the constituents and restoring a sense of trust. Without trust, then the rest just falls by the wayside. If i’m lucky enough to serve, it’s putting that first and foremost when I am in office.
Time: 3:56
How has the President affected your campaign positively and negatively?
Negatively from the standpoint that his policies are hurting people. Whether it is climate change or the economy, the national debt is as 22 trillion dollars and climate change is infinitely worse. He’s contributed to this real sense of divisiveness in our country. And it’s scary because without discourse, you can’t have Democracy. When you can’t reach across the aisle and have respect for people that have different backgrounds and values, but nevertheless want to to help people in the same way. When you can’t have those conversations, then you can’t have a functioning government. What Trump does is weaponize that sense of outrage and anger, so that people aren’t willing to have a conversation. If we continue four more years of this, we’ll be looking at a situation where we have to ask ourselves, is this curable? It’s reached the point now where were almost at a tipping point, and if don’t fix it, it’s going to be a real issue going forward.
Time: 5:04
What’s your stance on the legalization or recreation of marijuana?
I support it. A young black man is 60% more likely to get arrested for a marijuana crime than a white man. It’s the reason why black youth make up a disproportionate majority of our prison population: it’s because of marijuana. It’s still a schedule 1 drug. If we not only decriminalize but legalize it as well, it will give police the ability to go after crimes that are really hurting people and reform our critical justice system in a desperately needed way.
Time: 5:48
How would you work with Republicans in a bipartisan way?
One of my favorite quotes from Benjamin Franklin is when he was asked by a journalist after the constitutional convention whether he agreed with the final draft. He responded, “I agree with none of it, and that’s why it’s perfect.” It is a recognition that Democracy requires compromise. You have to work across the aisle, and the reason Democracy is broken right now is because we don’t. I’ll take each issue on it’s own merit. I’ll have issues and values that I won’t compromise on, but at the same time, if we’re moving the ball forward and helping people in a deliberate way, then regardless of party, I think that’s what voters really want. Absolutely, if i’m lucky enough to serve, reaching across the aisle and working together is a top priority.
Time: 6:56
Under what circumstances would you ever tell a lie?
This is like one of those famous philosophy questions. Was it Hegel who asked if the Gestapo is at your door during World War II and ask if you know somebody who is Jewish, what do you say? So, it depends on the circumstances I guess.
But as a public official, I've said all along voters are brave enough to be told the truth. I’m willing to admit when I mess up, when there’s been an error or a problem, and tell voters what the issue is and here is how we fix it. I don’t think as a public official you can lie about the circumstances and challenges we face. Although I recognize that there are potential caveats, morally, depending on your circumstance.
Time: 7:46
Do you have a political role model?
John Lewis. I’ve got my picture with him up there actually. He was 20 years old when he joined the Freedom Riders, he walked from Selma to Montgomery with Dr. King, he was beaten and thrown in jail for something that he believed in. If you look back to 1968, the Tet Offensive was in January during the Vietnam war, Dr. King was shot in April, Bobby Kennedy was shot in June, and then Nixon was nominated in July on the back of the Southern strategy. John Lewis stayed through it all. He was brave enough to put himself out there and risk his life, and he’s been my role model ever since I first learned about him.
Time: 8:55
What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?
So my dad always says, “Courage is a muscle.” You’re not born courageous, I mean some people might be, but you gotta put yourself out there. If there’s someone you wanna go on a date with, ask them. If there’s a sport you wanna try, try it. If you wanna write a book or go into music or a passion that you have, follow it. Have the courage to take chances, and if it doesn’t work out, that’s OK. Don’t listen to what other people tell you to do or not do, if they don’t have your best interest in mind. Like my parents always told me, “just do what you want to do and follow your passion, and the rest will fall in place.” That idea of practicing being courageous and putting yourself in vulnerable positions, I look back on it now, and that’s probably the best advice I got.

Team:
Today, Michael announced he is joining Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris in introducing the Justice in Policing Act – what is set to be the most comprehensive police reform legislation in history.
This is a critical step in dismantling centuries of systemic oppression and racism in our country – and it’s a step we need to take now.
The bill focuses on four reforms:
* Holding police accountable in our courts
* Increasing transparency through new methods of data collection and reporting
* Improving police training and practices
* Making lynching a federal crime
In order for law enforcement to receive federal funding, they will need to comply with these reforms. That means officers will be required to wear body cameras, complete training on racial discrimination and profiling, and be banned from employing practices like chokeholds.
This is a bold, ambitious plan to seek racial justice and equal protection under the law for the black community. Michael is ready to take action with Cory and Kamala to fight for its passage. Will you join them?
The time for meaningful, structural change is here – and we need to gather as much support as possible. If you’re ready for nation-wide police reform, add your name:

Help me bring back accountability in November.
Friends,
As you may have already heard, Attorney General Ken Paxton was accused by his top aides for multiple crimes that include bribery and abuse of office. And on top of that, he’s refusing to resign. But this isn’t the first time Paxton was let off the hook from using his office for personal gain:
First: Paxton abused people’s faith in his public office after being indicted in 2015 for Securities Fraud.
Then: Paxton tried to eliminate healthcare coverage for millions of Texans and threatened to prosecute those who wanted to vote by mail.
Now: Paxton is refusing to resign and our leaders are letting him get away with it again.
Texans deserve better than this. And our chance to bring accountability back to our state is only 24 days away. Pitch in $25 today to help us bring about real change to Texas on November 3rd >>>
As your next Congresswoman, I promise to never serve special interests and rich corporations. I work for you, and I will protect you from those who abuse their power in office like Attorney General Ken Paxton. But I need your help to make this possible.

Dear Alex --
The last several days have been gut wrenching for millions of Americans who know we’ve reached a breaking point. Let me state clearly, the killing of our black boys, men, and women can not be tolerated when there are proven evidence-based policies to eliminate police brutality, end mass incarceration, and usher in an era of community healing.
Last week, I joined thousands of people in a peaceful vigil and march from Carl Schurz Park through the Upper East Side of New York City and millions others around the globe. Make no mistake, Change isn’t just coming for America, Change is Here.
If you’re as angry, frustrated, and heartbroken as I am, know that you have the power to make real change. I join countless Americans in outrage at the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and thousands of other Black people at the hands of police.

But you can do more than be outraged.
You can help remove people from office who helped build systems of oppression and whose very language around the trauma that is inflicting our nation is arcane and offensive.
My opponent’s record on criminal justice reform is abhorrent, it is one of the main reasons that, as an attorney, I decided to challenge her and was the centerpiece of my campaign two years ago.
Rep. Maloney came up in an era of “tough on crime” policies that carried forward the legacy of state sanctioned brutality against black people. Like many up and coming politicians of the 1990s, she signed onto the painful 1994 Crime Bill which included, among other things mandatory minimums for non-violent offenses.
Many people make mistakes, some admit them, some learn from them, some remediate them. Scores of legislation to remediate that bill have come up over the last 3 decades that she’s been in office. She has an atrocious record on supporting them.
Here’s a list of bills I support that Rep. Maloney has not signed onto:
H.R.2927 - Preventing Tragedies Between Police and Communities Act of 2019
H.R.1714 - Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act
H.R.2835 - Deterring Undue Enforcement by Protecting Rights Of Citizens from Excessive Searches and Seizures Act of 2019
H.R.120 - Police CAMERA Act of 2019
H.R.4339 - End Racial Profiling Act of 2019
Some moments we know call for a clean break from the past and they call for a new generation of leaders. We’re at a tipping point as a country and we need fighters to take on Trump, not ones who supply him with the rhetoric he is using to threaten our Cities today.

Dear Alex --
New reporting from The Intercept digs into my opponent's disqualifying record on race and policing.
“Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat, has been among the most vocal supporters of aggressive police tactics.”
We know that new ideas and evidence-based policies are needed to address race relations and policing in America. We also know, now, that the “tough on crime” policies of the 1980s and 1990s created more problems than they solved.
It’s time for a change - a clean break from the past.

250,"Shoot first and think later isn't foreign policy, it's just the same old ""tough"" rhetoric.
Shoot first and think later isn't foreign policy, it's just the same old ""tough"" rhetoric. The scary thing, however, is that under Donald Trump, it’s not just rhetoric anymore, it’s become dangerous action.
For too long, a generation of leaders - Democrats and Republicans - have long believed that tough on crime is better than smart on crime, tough on war is better than smart on war. They have been too quick to rush my generation into wars that were ill-conceived for goals that don't match our vision for a peaceful world. Those politicians no longer deserve the benefit of the doubt after decades of advocating for war. You can't keep being wrong over and over and hope that you're eventually right.
Change is long overdue.
Qassem Soleimani was a terrorist responsible for the deaths of thousands, including American service members and intelligence officers. He was no friend of ours, but make no mistake, this was an ill-thought out extrajudicial killing and its repercussions will have to be dealt with for as long as we have ""war as a first"" mentality from our leaders--all of our leaders.
What we must demand from our elected leaders is not a race to war, but a diplomatic solution. Rep. Carolyn Maloney has a history of supporting reckless Middle East policy and aligning herself with the foreign policy of President Trump. We cannot allow a war with Iran to once again create a vacuum of stability and power. We cannot allow the same old politics to drag us into the same old conflicts.
Our community supports quick work by our United States Representatives to de-escalate the situation and prevent another costly, and deadly, war in the region. We support diplomacy over militarism. We support defeating President Donald Trump in November, but we also demand congressional leadership that advocates protection of human life over destructive warmongering.

As we celebrate the last unofficial days of summer, let's not forget to recognize the union organizers who have made it possible for us to enjoy weekends like these with our loved ones. We owe many of the workplace protections we enjoy today to their unwavering commitment to fighting for better jobs, better working conditions, and stronger families.
When our workers are taken care of -- our community is stronger. Whether it's our selfless educators, our resilient ship builders, or our dedicated service employees, the women and men of labor movements have helped build our Commonwealth and our country.
But right now, too many Americans are facing real hardship. The fight for the security and dignity of our workers is far from over -- we must continue the fight for living wages and access to quality and affordable health care.
As a member of Congress, I'm proud to represent hard working Virginians and I will never stop fighting to ensure our working families, seniors, and veterans get the benefits they have earned.
Thanks again, and from my family to yours, I hope you have a safe and happy Labor Day.
Here's to continuing the good work,
Elaine

Alex,
At last Saturday’s Women’s March here in Flagstaff, we heard some deep truths from several amazing women.
I want to share one message in particular with you. We all must understand, what is happening here in the land of the First People is an indictment of our current system. Carmenlita Chieff, of the Indigeonous Circle of Flagstaff, explained what it’s like to be made unwelcome and invisible in her home, the land of her ancestors. Think about that for a moment. It is nothing short of a crime.
Ms. Chieff put a name to what is happening: colonialism. Right now indigenous women represent 5% of the population of Flagstaff, but make up 10% of the incarcerated population of Coconino County. Indigenous men make up 35-40% of the incarcerated population, and are only 5% of the total population of Flagstaff.
Imagine what this does to indigenous households; women and children in particular shoulder the brunt of poverty that is baked into the system for them; a cycle they have little hope of escaping.
The cycle of criminalizing indigenous people must be broken, and the only way to do that is through deep structural change; the kind of restructuring that acknowledges we are benefitting from stolen land, and that everyone who lives here in AZ-01 deserves to be treated with the same dignity and humanity.
If you’d like to hear Carmenlita's powerful speech from the Flagstaff Women's March, please click on the link below. Help me raise the voices of all women, including women whose people have been here on this land since time immemorial.

Alex,
Today is Juneteenth, the oldest nationally celebrated commemoration of the ending of slavery in the United States.
This unofficial holiday comes in the midst of a true revolution in our country — people marching in the streets because they are sick and tired of black people being murdered by the systemic racism and white supremacy seen not only in our policing system, but in every fabric of our country.
Most of us agree — this moment was long overdue.
But to understand where we are now and how we move forward, we must acknowledge the fact that our entire nation was founded on the brutal manifestation of racism that is slavery.
White people enslaved black people, tied them up in chains, put them on ships, and brought them to America to exploit their entire being. White America used slave labor to build America’s capitalist economy. Even the institutions our country holds as beacons of democracy and freedom — The White House and the US Capitol — were built by slaves.
Even centuries after slavery ended, we are still living with its legacy every day. As historian and Black studies professor Karlos K. Hill of the University of Oklahoma said, “Even though slavery came to an end in 1865, the desire to master and dominate black bodies did not, and we have never dealt with that”.
There’s no more glaring example of this than our policing and justice system. Since Jan. 1, 2015, 1,252 black people have been shot and killed by police. And many of the officers, most of whom are white, are rarely held accountable for their actions. Lynching is still not a federal hate crime.
Now is the time for our country to address the fundamental sins it was built on and work to build a truly just society.
My fellow Brand New Congress slate member Jamaal Bowman (NY-16) released a Reconstruction Agenda, and I fully endorse and support it.
It will:
* Establish a National Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate, document, and assess the federal government’s role in America’s history of racism and study reparations,
* Shift funding and resources from police departments, jails, and prisons to new agencies designed to protect public health,
* and provide a historic investment to provide all Americans with the things we need to thrive, like Medicare for All and housing justice.
Today, I urge you to read Jamaal’s article in The Nation, “It’s Time to Make Juneteenth a National Holiday” (which I also support), watch Vox’s explainer video on Juneteeth, and to support local black businesses that desperately need help in the COVID-19 crisis.
The change doesn’t start tomorrow. It starts now.

# Nicole Galloway for Missouri
Hey team,
Governor Parson finally realized that we need action on the heartbreaking violence plaguing our communities. He’s called for a special legislative session, but he’s failed to recognize the role that gun safety has on this issue.
Missouri has one of the highest rates of gun deaths per year and some of the weakest gun laws in the country. We cannot afford to have these facts continue to be ignored by politicians in our state.
We need REAL action to deal with the devastating gun violence in our state. That’s why today, we’re asking you to please sign our petition demanding common-sense gun safety measures from our leaders in Jefferson City.
SIGN THE PETITION
Last year, when Missourians pleaded with the Governor for a response to children being murdered by gunfire, he said he had to “stay in his lane” — he later called a special session about tax breaks for used cars and yachts instead. And just as he’s finally called for a special session, he’s also continuing to celebrate and parade his A+ rating from the NRA.
Nicole Galloway knows we need real action to confront this epidemic of gun violence. We need common-sense gun safety laws like universal background checks and permits, and we need to let local communities adopt gun safety and anti-crime measures when leaders in Jefferson City fail to act.
It’s well past time that Governor Parson and Missouri politicians got serious about gun violence in Missouri. If you agree, add your name to our call for our leaders to take real action against gun violence right now >>
SIGN THE PETITION
Thanks for making a difference,
Team Galloway

# Nicole Galloway for Missouri
Earlier today, Parson's PAC launched a new wave of attacks filled with shocking and obvious lies, like accusing me and supporters like you of being ""pro-crime.""
I won't dignify these offensive and false attacks with a response. But I will tell you what it says about this race: The status quo is running scared.
In a moment, I'll ask you for your help to fight back — but first, let me explain.
On Governor Parson's watch, everyday families have struggled with rising healthcare costs, underfunded schools and fewer opportunities — all while insiders and mega-donors have been raking in favors and kickbacks. When I'm governor, that all comes to an end — and the folks in power know it.
When we launched this campaign, early polls had us down against Parson by double digits. Now more than a year, multiple fundraising records, and millions of calls and texts later, our grassroots movement has made Missouri a battleground state. The billionaires and special interests are spinning up outrageous lies every week because they're panicking — as they should be.
As Auditor, I've been the taxpayers’ independent watchdog. I've uncovered more than $370 million in wasted or stolen taxpayer money and brought more than 60 criminal counts against corrupt public officials from both political parties. When I say I'll end their culture of corruption, they know it's no BS — that's why I'm running to defeat Mike Parson, and it's why I'm asking for your support today:
Will you add a donation of $5 or whatever you can to my campaign so we can set the record straight for undecided voters before Election Day? We can’t settle for a bought-and-paid-for system any longer — not during this pandemic and not for what comes next — so your donation right now is critical.
Thanks for making a difference when it matters most,
Nicole

Dear Brown,
Yesterday, the Austin Asian Communities Civic Coalition held a candidate forum for all of the Travis County Congressional districts. You can view the forum here. The questions for TX-17 candidates begin at the 53 minute mark.
Pete Sessions avoided answering the moderator's direct questions, and instead talked about the strength of the stock market and the need for law and order.
The first question was about the most important issue on his website - stopping welfare abuse by illegal immigrants. Sessions claimed that it's not his most important issue and pivoted to the party line touting the strength of the stock market. The issue is in fact the only issue he addresses on his website.
When challenged in a follow up question that the stock market doesn't reflect the general economy, he falsely claims that Steve Mnuchin is a Democrat, and implies that since ""only 1 in 64 Americans"" has tested positive for COVID-19, we need to get our kids back to school so we can all go back to work.
The death toll has passed 175,000.
Finally, I encourage you to go to the 1:30 mark. When asked in a follow up whether President Trump respects the rule of law, he says, ""you know what I'm in reference to - I'm in reference to Portland, Minneapolis, Chicago..."" In Session’s interpretation, rule of law applies to heavy-handed suppression of protests but not to potential crimes committed by those in Trump’s administration or by the president himself.
Sessions' strategy was to de-emphasize the economic and health impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, while I spoke about needing an effective government response that will allow us to recover. We need new leadership, not more of the same.
Demand Better. Pitch in now and help me beat Pete.

Alex --
Good evening and welcome to our Week-End Update.
This week, much of the news in Washington revolved around the impeachment hearings in the U.S. Senate. Over the past months and weeks, I have detailed my feelings regarding the impeachment sham.
I believe that the Wall Street Journal’s Kimberly Strassel encapsulates many of the points I have been stressing and makes a compelling case, in her piece Crying Wolf on Impeachment against the Democratic leadership. She writes:
“The impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump is coming down to one big question: Will Democrats, by crying wolf, drown out the more legitimate Republican cry of foul? ‘Foul’ has served as the GOP’s most powerful and honest argument from the first days of these impeachment maneuverings.”
“Democrats broke every standard of due process, transparency and fairness in their House investigation, making a mockery of their constitutional duty.”
* “They hid the identity of the original accuser, denying Republicans and the country the ability to judge his motives.”
* “They held secret depositions, barring more than three-quarters of House members, as well as the press and the American public.”
* “They called 18 witnesses, but blocked the president from calling any in his defense.”
* “The White House legal team was excluded from the proceedings—prohibited from cross-examining witnesses, denied the ability to introduce any evidence that spoke to the central question of the president’s focus on Ukrainian corruption.”
* “Democrats approved two articles of impeachment that failed to identify a crime.”
The U.S. Senate rejected the call for more witnesses in the impeachment trial. House Democratic Leadership has failed to make a case for impeachment and there is no reason to call additional witnesses. It was interesting to see that the Democrats were hellbent on calling additional witnesses as long as they are not Joe or Hunter Biden. Maybe because they are like an onion, the more you peel the Bidens back, the more you cry. Thankfully for our nation, it appears this saga will be concluding in the coming days... or as the New York Post headline reads below, it's ""All Over But The Pouting.""
The President made strides in our efforts towards peace between Israel and Palestine. Peace requires compromise, but Israel cannot compromise the security of their country or its people. President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu created an agreement that balances peaceful coexistence with the need for security.
Additionally, President Trump signed the USMCA trade agreement.
This historic trade deal is another example of President Trump’s policies putting our workers, farmers, and manufacturers first.
* USMCA adds $68 billion to our economy and will create 176,000 jobs nationwide. The President signing USMCA delivers a key promise to level the playing field for our country in trade.
* Mexico and Canada are key markets for goods and agricultural products from Pennsylvania. This deal supports farmers and businesses in our district by improving their market access and is an especially great improvement for our dairy producers.
* USMCA ushers in a more balanced and fairer trading relationship for North America and is a big win for America and Pennsylvania.
I spoke on the floor of the United States House this week about the different definitions of productivity at the two ends of Pennsylvania Avenue at this point in time. At the Capitol, Democrat Leadership continues to confuse activity with accomplishment. They have spent YEARS trying to impeach and remove a duly elected president. However, at the White House, President Trump has delivered two significant victories this week... a middle east peace plan and the signing of the USMCA. Just imagine of all the energy from this impeachment was used to solve the problems of the American people. It is critical Republicans #TakeBackTheHouse
IN NEWS YOU WON’T HEAR IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA: This week, I voted against the House Democrat Leadership's attempt to further weaken our countries ability to respond to terrorists in a combat zone by stripping the President as Commander and Chief's authority to engage our military to target and eliminate terrorists or enemies of the state. This authority was effectively put to use to takeout terrorist Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Soleimani was designated a terrorist by multiple countries. This legislation is being brought to the House floor for a vote only to damage the President politically and with a blind eye to our countries safety.
The 2002 Authorization for Use MF authorizes military action to “defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq,” including against ISIS and threats directed by Iran.
Repealing the Authorization for Use of Military Force without a replacement would undermine the Iraqi government, send the wrong signal to our regional partners and allies, and embolden Iran-backed militia groups who fuel sectarian violence.
On Tuesday, we paused to observe Holocaust Remembrance Day and recognize the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We remember the survivors, those who were lost and pledge to fight anti-Semitism. #NeverAgain
We also recognized School Choice Week. Families should have the ability to choose a school that best fits their needs, child’s skills and interests. This is an opportunity to advocate for choice and celebrate public, private, parochial and all schools educating our youth for the jobs of today and tomorrow.
Today is also the beginning of Black History Month and we celebrate the lasting legacies of African Americans whose lives have shaped our nation’s history and culture. Today, black Americans have someone in the White House in President Trump who is delivering record low unemployment.
One of the most significant accomplishments of the Trump Administration has been the President’s success in making our nation energy independent. No longer are we held hostage to the Middle East as we work to ensure our nation can produce its own power to keep us all moving. As part of that effort, President Trump is working to save over 1,000 family-sustaining jobs in Pennsylvania by helping to keep the refinery in Philadelphia open. Click here to read more.
I joined other members of Congress as we received a briefing from Dr. Redfield from the Center for Disease Control, Dr. Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Kadlec from the Department of Health and Human Services, and Jonathan Fritz and Yolanda Parra from the State Department regarding the coronavirus. Their briefing provided the following information:
* At this time, the virus poses a low risk to the United States and there are only 5 confirmed cases here.
* There are 6,000 confirmed cases in China concentrated mostly in Wuhan Province. Chinese officials have severely restricted travel from Wuhan Province to contain the virus there.
* Treatments are being developed but may take a year to be fully developed. As health officials contain this virus, the U.S. CDC recommends against all nonessential travel to China.
* The CDC feels the best way to contain coronavirus is through classic public health measures such as maintaining a high level of hygiene, regularly washing your hands, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and face.
Chinese and American officials are in regular contact and we will receive updates as will the general public. I will provide future updates as I receive them. For additional information about coronavirus and how to prevent its spread, visit the CDC website.
In the District, I want to send out my congratulations and support to Lebanon County’s former District Attorney and our new State Senator Dave Arnold. Dave was sworn-in on Wednesday and will be a tremendous addition Harrisburg. Dave is a conservative and understands that smaller government and lower taxes leads to prosperity. As many of you know. Dave was diagnosed with brain cancer shortly after receiving the GOP nomination for State Senate. Dave is beating cancer and his doctors have given him an excellent prognosis. This situation highlights the strength of Dave’s family as his wife and daughter stood by his side as he battled cancer and won his election to the state senate. I look forward to working alongside Dave as we focus on making Lebanon County an even better place to live, work and raise our families.
Additionally, I want to acknowledge our new Lebanon County District Attorney Pier Hess Graf. She will be a strong voice against crime and be tenacious in her work to keep our streets safe.
As a reminder, as this is an election year, we have begun circulating petitions to run for reelection to Congress. Petition circulation begins this Tuesday, January 28th. If you would like to join our team, please let us know. For copies of petitions, questions or information regarding petition events across the District, please contact our Field Campaign Manager Rob Bresnahan at [[URL REDACTED]]
Today, we attended the Berks County GOP meeting, where I officially announced my intentions to seek another term in office. Representing the people of the 9th District is a tremendous honor and responsibility. My goal every day is to do what’s in the best interests of the families, neighborhoods and communities in our District. Berks County has always been so welcoming to our campaign and we felt it was appropriate to make our formal reelection announcement surrounding by our friends and supporters in the County. Pictured below with GOP Auditor General candidate Tim DeFoor and a younger supporter Suzannah Gillen who I gave my lapel pin.
Later, we attended the Columbia County GOP Winter Picnic. We were joined by State Senator John Gordner and State Representatives David Millard and Kurt Masser. This was a great event and there is a lot of enthusiasm for President Trump and the Republican ticket. Pictured below with Ashok & Naymesh Patel and children.
Last week, we inserted a political cartoon we thought was timely regarding the impeachment effort. This week, I have another cartoon I found that I think is appropriate considering tomorrow is Groundhog Day. Enjoy.
On Monday, I will appear on WPPA “Step up to the Mic” from 10-11 am. If you get a chance, please be sure to tune in.
Thank you and we will see you soon,

Good afternoon and welcome to our Week-End Update.
Impeachment:
Since the day he was sworn in, the priority of House Democrats has been to scrutinize, delegitimize, charge with crimes, and remove from office President Donald J. Trump.
The process, players, and underlying proof at the heart of this impeachment have been fundamentally flawed and brazenly biased. Click here to view my interview on WBRE regarding impeachment.
We have witnessed a blatantly unfair process: carefully choosing rehearsed witnesses, hiding exculpatory evidence, limiting dissenting views, and denying the President due process.
Chairmen Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff have led this impeachment process by presuming the President’s guilt and racing towards a predetermined outcome. Chairman Nadler, along with two-thirds of the Democrat Judiciary Committee membership, voted to advance impeachment before any call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky even took place. Equally disturbing, Intelligence Committee Chairman Schiff has a record of being untruthful to the American people regarding the details of his investigation, basic facts, and his staff’s interaction with ‘the whistleblower.’
Despite all of this, Democrats still failed to provide any proof of Presidential wrongdoing. After months of polling and focus group testing aimed at creating the most politically advantageous allegations against our President, Democrat leadership arrived at two charges, ‘abuse of power’ and ‘obstruction of Congress.’ These vague terms attempt to mask the fact that months of congressional investigations have produced one simple and undeniable fact: President Trump did not commit an impeachable offense.
Not only are these articles vague, but each is also easily dispelled. President Zelensky’s confirmation of ‘no pressure’ and ‘no quid pro quo’ immediately negates the validity of any charge of Presidential ‘abuse of power.’ The President has inherent Constitutional executive authorities and privileges. If House Democrats classify the utilization of those authorities as an ‘obstruction of Congress,’ every President since Jimmy Carter – and every President moving forward – would and will be impeached.
This entire year has been a period of opportunity lost. Rather than working to improve the lives of the American public, this Democrat-led Congress has focused its full time and attention on passing partisan legislation and driving political outcomes. I look forward to the new year of 2020 and enacting legislation to benefit seniors, veterans, farmers, and families. As the Senate will hold a fair trial to evaluate this case – without presumption – I am 100 percent confident the President will not be removed from office. In spite of the Democrats’ desperate tactics to win the White House by removing the President, the people will ultimately decide who will be elected in 2020.
Spending Bill:
This week, I appeared on Fox Business to discuss bills passed to fund the Federal government for the next fiscal year. There were two bills offered. I voted for the spending bill that funds our national defense and border security. The second spending bill had excessive spending I could not support. Nevertheless it's the best President Trump will get from this Pelosi-led House, so he will sign it. This is another big reason Republicans must win back control of the U.S. [[URL REDACTED]] here or below to watch my interview.
IN NEWS YOU WON""T HEAR ON MAINSTREAM MEDIA: Last night our nation heard each Democrat candidate for the White House embrace two things. Hatred for President Trump and SOCIALISM.
Their socialist views of America were on full display. They are:
* Pushing full government-run healthcare and want to make private health insurance ILLEGAL.
* Embracing open borders that would flood our nation with illegal immigrants.
* Supporting hypocritical anti-energy policies, like the gan-Green New Deal, that would kill 10 million American jobs.
Worse yet, each Democrat has allowed their blind hatred for President Trump to express the truth about the many successes President Trump has accomplished, especially as it has related to the economy. Here are the FACTS:
* Since President Trump was elected, the U.S. has added 7.2 million jobs.
* The U.S. added 266,000 jobs in November.
* The unemployment rate is at 3.5%, remaining near a 50 year low in November.
* Wage growth was 3.1% year over year in November, the 16th month in a row wages have grown more than 3%, a benchmark reached for just 3 months total under President Obama.
* Consumer Sentiment remained historically high in November.
* The unemployment rate for African-Americans is 5.5%, near a record low.
* More than 524,000 manufacturing jobs have been added since President Trump was elected, while 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost under President Obama.
* Hispanic American unemployment remained near historic lows at 4.2% in November.
* Asian American unemployment is at 2.6%.
* Real median household income is at a record high of $65,084.
* The number of Americans in poverty is at the lowest point since 2007.
USMCA:
On Thursday, the House supported the President's efforts to make our economy even stronger by passing the USMCA, a historic trade deal for our country, and a big win for workers, farmers, and manufacturers in Pennsylvania and across the nation.
The agreement will continue to drive growth by adding $68 billion to the U.S. economy and creating 176,000 jobs across the country. Trade with Canada and Mexico supports more than 470,000 jobs in Pennsylvania alone, and more than 42,000 jobs in Pennsylvania depend on manufacturing exports to these countries. Canada and Mexico are also some of the most important markets for Pennsylvania’s agricultural exports. This deal will create a more balanced trade relationship with our North American partners and improve market access for our producers and processors – especially for our dairy and poultry farmers.
The President’s negotiation of this critical deal will establish free, fair, and reciprocal trade for our nation and allow for the high-quality foods and products that come from Pennsylvania’s Ninth District to be enjoyed worldwide.
Wishing you happy holidays and blessed Christmas,

Alex --
Good evening. Welcome to our Week-End Update.
I want to begin our update by again thanking the brave men and women, the doctors, nurses, health care providers, police, firefighters, small businesses and countless others putting their lives in jeopardy to support their fellow Pennsylvanians during the COVID-19 pandemic. I also want to again express my condolences to the families who have lost family or friends to the virus. The tide is turning, but I realize that is of little comfort to those families who have been directly affected by the loss of a closed loved one due to COVID-19.
This week, our staff and I continued to work with constituents and businesses to navigate the Covid-19 climate and transition as stay-at-home orders are lifted and many begin to return to work. This week, Governor Tom Wolf began the process of reopening Pennsylvania. The Governor announced that on May 8, 2020, twenty-four counties will partially reopen, mostly in northwestern and north-central parts of Pennsylvania. The 24 counties that will are Bradford, Cameron, Centre, Clarion, Clearfield, Clinton, Crawford, Elk, Erie, Forest, Jefferson, Lawrence, Lycoming, McKean, Mercer, Montour, Northumberland, Potter, Snyder, Sullivan, Tioga, Union, Venango, and Warren. Click here to read the Governor’s press release.
I will continue to advocate for Pennsylvania to follow the CDC guidelines and be innovative regarding our Commonwealth's own situation as they begin to reopen. We need to be inclusive with the private sector to establish safe working standards so our economy can begin recovering in a safe manner. There is no question that we have had a very deliberate shutdown of our economy. However, we cannot cause businesses to go bankrupt and for families to go without essential needs. This is why Congress passed the CARES Act, which has proven to be a good comprehensive plan to address the economic issues caused by the virus. Governors throughout the nation must be strategic as they safely open up the economy and create revenue. We cannot afford to see states create budget deficits so large that cause many of our citizens' longterm pain.
In other business, as a member of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, I participated in a virtual forum to discuss “Coronavirus Pandemic Response: The Impact of Economic and Health Care Services on Homeless Veterans in America.”
I also received an update by the Congressional Budget Office receiving projections of output, employment and interest rates and a preliminary look at Federal deficits for 2020 and 2021. There is no way to minimize the impact that COVID-19 has had on our economy. Unemployment has risen and our GDP has declined. However, there are signs that indicate that our economy can and will rebound. Let us not forget that before COVID-19, the American economy, due in large part to the leadership of President Donald Trump, was humming. Unemployment was at historic lows and businesses were thriving. We will recover and President Trump and Congressional Republicans will empower the PRIVATE sector to ensure a strong recovery.
We held several tele-town halls with our constituents from the 9th District to discuss the COVID-19 outbreak, and in particular, unemployment compensation benefits. I was joined on one of the tele-town calls by Pennsylvania Secretary of Labor and Industry W. Gerald Oleksiak and Unemployment Compensation Director Susan Dickinson. I spoke about the CARES Act, which included economic relief payments and supplemental unemployment payments meant to help individuals who lost their jobs through no fault of their own. For a full recap of the call, please read this article from The Reading Eagle.
I conducted a tele-town hall with Americans for Prosperity and Concerned Veterans of America. We had a Q&A with our veteran community and discussed the many ways that the Federal government and our office are working to assist veterans throughout the 9th District during the COVID-19 outbreak. We are greatly aided in that effort by having one of the premier hospitals, the Lebanon VA, in our District. If any veteran in our District is having trouble with their benefits, please contact our office.
We also participated in a tele-town hall with the International Franchise Association and many of its members throughout Pennsylvania with Congressman Kevin Hern.
Additionally, I held teleconference calls with the community banks and credit unions throughout the 9th Congressional. Republican Ranking Member of the Financial Services Committee Patrick McHenry joined me on this call to answer questions. I do want to again commend our community banks for their great effort and work related to the PPP loan process. Nothing of this magnitude is perfect, but the quantity of loans going out in such a short period of time is very commendable. Many banks are working multiple shifts and weekends. The second phase of the PPP, which began on Monday, seems to be going very well. Thus far, the average loan amount is less than $100k. It is not often that the intent of a government program is in line with the results.
The Treasurer's office issued some new FAQ's related to the PPP program that has raised additional questions. Please know that we are anticipating added guidance to many of your questions on this. Once available, we will be sure to get this information out to you.
There were also big developments related to the agricultural industry, where nearly $20 billion is being allocated via the USDA directly to the agricultural community with a good portion to Pennsylvania farmers and our dairy industry which has suffered much during this crisis. We as Pennsylvanians need to all understand the importance of our farms and whenever possible have a glass of milk. It does a body good.
As part of our continued effort to keep constituents informed regarding the COVID-19 outbreak and related issues, I conducted interviews with R.J. Harris on WHP580 (Listen by clicking here); with Jason Barsky on WILK-FM; WFMZ’s Business Matters (Watch by clicking here or on the picture below);
This Week in Pennsylvania with Dennis Owen’s on ABC-27 (Watch by clicking here or on the picture below);
C-SPAN's Washington Journal (Watch by clicking here or on the picture below);
NewsMax TV’s National Report (Watch by clicking here or on the picture below).
IN NEWS YOU WON’T READ IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA: The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) officially relaunched this week. After distributing $350 billion in loans to 1.6 million small businesses earlier this month, the program ran out of funds in just 14 days. Thankfully, Congress agreed to replenish the popular program.
The President signed that $310 billion funding. This week, President Trump welcomed small business owners to the White House to share their stories from the first successful round of loans in early April. Here are a sampling of their comments:
* Amy Wright of Bitty + Beau’s Coffee has said that her business-saving loan “is a game-changer for us.”
* Ed and Jim’s Body Shop in Pennsylvania has been in business for over 50 years. As Coronavirus forced Americans to stay home, owner Brandon Hutson had to lay off most of his workers. Now, the shop can reemploy its furloughed staff and provide each of them with a paycheck—a “live-saver for us,” Hutson says.
* Tony Stafford had to furlough over 100 employees when he was forced to close the dining rooms of his 3 restaurants in Virginia. “I promised every one of [my workers] we would get through this,” he said. “When we applied and received the PPP loan, I knew that I would be able to keep that promise.”
* JD Clark is a construction and maintenance firm specializing in low-income and affordable housing. All of its contracts were put on hold because of Coronavirus. Owner Tisa Clark describes talking to one of her employees, a single mother, after securing a PPP loan. “I could just see the relief coming to her!” Ms. Clark said.
With last week’s signing, President Trump has now allocated more than $660 billion for the loan program in total. During PPP’s first run, the Small Business Administration and the Treasury Department processed 14 years’ worth of loans in less than 14 days.
These loans have helped save 30 million American jobs so far.
In non-COVID-19 related news, the revelation that evidence has surfaced that top officials in the FBI worked to set-up former White House national security advisor Michael Flynn is disturbing. This group of FBI leader are supposed to exist to investigate crimes, not to create them. In this scenario, these individuals were successful in destroying Mr. Flynn’s name, reputation and cost him his job. These horrible public servants, paid with taxpayer funds, need to be investigated and held responsible. As it appears right now, General Flynn's name and reputation should be cleared. Let's hope the media presents this story even half as much as they spent tearing down General Flynn and the President.
I want to remind you again that, particularly during these trying times, I, as well as my entire Washington and District teams, are here for you. We are available for any issues you are facing that may require our assistance, we can help make contacts for you and know that the full weight of our office will be applied to help Pennsylvanians get through this crisis.
Please continue to help out where you can. For those of you on the frontline, Shelley and I are joining a host of Lebanon County elected officials in sponsoring another Take Out On Us event in Lebanon County on March 7 from 11 am - 1 pm. We are providing lunch as a thank you to those on the frontlines. See the details below.
My son and I were in the woods at 5 am this morning kicking off the opening day of spring turkey season. Unfortunately, we are getting take-out for dinner. (See picture below)
I hope you have a great weekend, stay safe and we will see you soon.

Alex --
Good morning and welcome to our Week-End Update.
This was a busy week in Washington as we again voted on legislation to support employees and small business owners recover as we continue the work of reopening our economy in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.
First, we passed a bill, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act, which gives small businesses more time to use PPP loans and addresses concerns around loan forgiveness. The bill extends the length of time businesses have to use the loans from 8 weeks to 24 weeks and pushes back the deadline to rehire workers. This new legislation, which still needs to pass in the U.S. Senate, is prospective for new loans. If passed and signed into law, those with current PPP loans can reapply under the new loan provisions. With many businesses still shutdown and the prospect of reopening potentially weeks away, these changes were necessary to continue to support these hardworking Pennsylvanians.
In related news, this week, I introduced the Coronavirus Swindlers, Crooks, and Manipulators (SCAM) Act, a bipartisan effort to crack down on the rising number of scams during the coronavirus pandemic. Some of the most common offenses have included phishing emails targeted at seniors and their recovery checks, websites selling fake masks, and deliberate misinformation regarding CDC guidance. The SCAM Act would heighten the penalties for those committing these crimes during the coronavirus pandemic.
Since the coronavirus pandemic began, there has been an unfortunate rise in the number of scams aimed at taking advantage of hardworking Americans and seniors. For example, the FTC has reported more than 50,000 scams totaling $38.6 million dollars and the IRS has investigated 15,000 false websites since economic impact payments began. These fraudulent schemes are always shameful, but scammers using this time of crisis to take advantage of vulnerable individuals is absolutely reprehensible. The SCAM Act warns that these scammers engaging in deceitful activities will pay a steep price.
In our efforts to keep people throughout the 9th District informed on the latest activities in Washington and important topics, I conducted a series of interviews with RJ Harris on WHP 580, the David Webb Show on SiriusXM Patriot, WPPA Pottsville and conducted an interview for the Trump Campaign with Tim Murtaugh which can be viewed by clicking here or on the picture below.
Over the past week, I participated in the Carbon County Strong Day with State Representative Doyle Heffley and Executive Director of the Carbon Chamber of Economic Development Corporation, Marlyn Kissner, to celebrate Carbon County Strong Day. Small businesses are the backbone of our communities. Carbon County Strong Day was a celebration of their resiliency over the past several months and a reminder for all of us to support them.
In the District, I participated in the Tamaqua Memorial Day ceremony with American Legion Post 73, which included a 21-gun salute, taps and wreath-laying.
Later, I attended a Port Carbon Memorial Day tribute at the Vietnam War home association, where I am a member. This Memorial Day tribute is usually packed with people. Even though different this year, Patriotism throughout the Pa-9 was never stronger. Pictured with member veterans and founding member Joe Kuperavage.
That evening, Shelley and I took a ride out to Harvey's Lake, stopped by Rick and Charlottes, met up with Bikers for Trump Tom Lantz and his All-American Harley. We talked about Freedom and the great Americans who sacrificed it all for us. It was a great Memorial Day.
In News You Won’t Read In The Mainstream Media: Congress was back in session for the first time with the new proxy voting rules in place.
* 70 \- The number of Democratic Congressional members who had another member vote for them.
* 0 \- The number of Republican Congressional members who had another member vote for them.
* 0 \- The number of times I will ever vote by proxy. I take my role to serve the 9th Congressional District seriously and you can ALWAYS count on me to show up and make sure you are being represented in person at the U.S. Capitol.
On Tuesday, House Republicans filed a lawsuit to block the practice of remote voting. As I have explained before, Article 1, Section 5 of the U.S. Constitution states that a quorum is necessary for House business to be conducted. I believe the House resolution is unconstitutional, and we are contesting that in court.
Election Update: Reminder, this Tuesday, June 2nd, is Primary Election Day and polls are open from 7 am-8 pm. Please vote. Our nation is facing unprecedented times and we have a critical election approaching in November. I humbly ask for your support of President Trump and myself. We must reelect President Trump and win back control of the U.S. House of Representatives. While I am unopposed in the Primary Election, I truly appreciate your support.
If you need yard signs for polling places or have questions related to the election, please feel free to contact our Field Campaign Manager Rob Bresnahan at [[URL REDACTED]]

Good evening and welcome to our Weekend Update.
I want to again begin by extending our best wishes to President Donald J. Trump and the First Lady on their recovery. It appears the President is in great shape and ready to hit the campaign trail again. This man cares deeply about our nation and I knew that Covid-19 would not keep him down very long. We look forward to seeing him again in Pennsylvania soon as we must ensure our Commonwealth goes for Trump again on November 3, 2020.
This week, we launched our first campaign web video, entitled People, Leadership, Our Future. During my time in office, I have worked to support President Trump’s America First Agenda, to advance federal legislation that is always in the interests of Pennsylvania and to communicate and be accessible to you in a highly effective manner. One of the ways we have done so is by recapping our activities and the latest news in these Weekly Update emails.
The upcoming election is about people, leadership and our future. It is critical that we win back control of the U.S. House and re-elect President Donald Trump. Click here or below to watch our video.
As part of our efforts to keep the public informed about our plans as we seek re-election, we participated in several candidate interviews. I answered questions for the Reading Eagle, which can be read by clicking here. We attended an editorial board meeting with the Daily Item and my interview can be viewed by clicking here or on the picture below.
This week, I joined my colleague Congressman Fred Keller and the Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration, Jovita Carranza, in Luzerne County to address local businesses that have received EIDL & PPP loans. The programs contained in the Cares Act have served as critical tools in the battle to support small businesses during this economic crisis. This critical funding has allowed small businesses to retain their employees and keep their doors open. In the 9th District alone, 7,789 PPP loans were administered, supporting 77,343 jobs. Across the Commonwealth, more than 89,000 EIDL loans provided $4.7 billion in assistance for businesses. Helping to get our economy moving back to its record pace is critical to supporting hardworking Americans and small businesses.
Additionally, I conducted a police ride-along with the Lansford Chief of Police Jack Soberick. We discussed the needs and challenges facing law enforcement. Our brave men and women in blue have one of the most difficult jobs in our nation and we owe them a debt of gratitude for the selfless way they put their lives on the line to protect our communities. As part of our visit, I met with Lansford Mayor Michele Bartek and Carbon County District Attorney Mike Greek. In Congress, I will always support our brave law enforcement officers.
Today, I joined the Greater Reading Regional Chamber Alliance for a Congressional candidate briefing. Click here to read an article recounting the event.
On Wednesday night, Vice President Mike Pence delivered a crushing defeat to higher taxes, more job loss, big-government policies, the Green New Deal and a ban on fracking, government-run healthcare, packing the Supreme Court and the Harris-Biden ticket.
The Vice President is a tremendous leader and successfully touted the many successes of President Trump’s America First Agenda. He did an equally great job of taking on the big government, extreme policy agenda of the Harris-Biden ticket. Click here or below to watch the Vice President take on their extreme agenda head-on.
IN NEWS YOU WON’T HEAR IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA: Kamala Harris and Joe Biden refuse to tell the American public the truth about their far-left, extreme agenda.
Kamala Harris \- Most liberal member of the Senate
* Kamala Harris’ radical beliefs should cause every American to worry about her being just one heartbeat away from becoming president.
* Kamala Harris will drastically raise Americans’ taxes, killing the Great American Comeback launched by President Trump:
* If you thought Joe Biden was bad, Kamala Harris said AOC’s radical tax hikes, including a 70 or 80 percent top tax rate, were ""fantastic.""
* Kamala Harris proudly voted against the Trump tax cuts that saved the average middle-class family of four $2,000 a year, and Harris said she would repeal the Trump tax cuts on “day one” – that’s a massive tax hike!
* Kamala Harris will take away Americans’ health care plans:
* Kamala Harris joined Bernie Sanders in introducing his plan for socialized medicine, which would cost over $32 trillion!
* Kamala Harris even said she wants to “eliminate” private insurance plans, saying “let’s move on.”
* That’s even worse than “if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor” – Harris is pledging to take Americans’ whole health care plan away!
* Kamala Harris is a disaster on trade and jobs:
* Kamala Harris is a globalist just like Joe Biden but maybe even worse. Harris voted against the USMCA trade deal and was one of only 10 senators to vote in favor of keeping the failed and job-killing NAFTA deal that Biden championed.
* Kamala Harris would destroy the American energy sector:
* Kamala Harris wants to eliminate all fracking, saying “there’s no question, I’m in favor of banning fracking.”
* Kamala Harris supports the job-killing Green New Deal, saying her version is the “most aggressive and progressive.”
* Kamala Harris is an open-borders radical:
* Kamala Harris is an open-borders radical who raised her hand in support of decriminalizing illegal border crossings.
* Kamala Harris wants to give away government-funded health insurance to illegal aliens.
* Kamala Harris supports sanctuary cities.
* Kamala Harris is weak on crime and bad on cops:
* Kamala Harris has the same crazy weak on crime, anti-police views as Joe Biden.
* Kamala Harris encouraged people to donate to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which bailed rapists, assaulters, and murderers out of jail.
* Kamala Harris supports L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti’s $150 million cut in police funding, and she agrees with the crazy idea to “reimagine” the role of the police.
* Kamala Harris said she was open to giving terrorists and rapists the right to vote from prison.
* Kamala Harris will take away Americans’ Second Amendment rights to keep and bear arms:
* Kamala Harris supports gun confiscation through a “mandatory buyback program” of “as many as 10 million” legally owned firearms.
* Kamala Harris is a total phony:
* Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden in the debate for praising and coddling racist segregationists, but now she turns a blind eye to it because she wants the power.
Joe Biden - Refuses to say he won’t pack the U.S. Supreme Court
* Joe Biden stated he would not tell the American public if he would pack the Supreme Court until the election is over.
* Joe Biden refused to give an answer if he would pack the Supreme Court at his debate with President Trump last week, and Kamala Harris refused to give an answer last night in her debate with Vice President Pence.
* Kamala Harris once said, “I'm open to this conversation about extending the number of people in the United States Supreme Court.”
Packing the Supreme Court removes the third branch of our system of checks and balances. A liberal court, packed by a far-left executive branch, will effectively torch our U.S. Constitution. This has become the most important issue in this election and we must all help assure all Americans understand the magnitude of what the Neo Democrats are planning.
Joe Biden owes the American people an answer on this issue before they cast their ballots. How can Americans vote for a candidate who refuses to tell how he will govern the nation? This is just another attempt by the Harris-Biden ticket to hide their far-left extreme agenda from voters… and worse yet, the mainstream media is letting them get away with it.
This was an exciting week and I love being home in the District. If you would like to show support for our campaign by putting up a yard sign, please feel free to contact us at [[URL REDACTED]]
Thank you and I hope to see you soon,

Good afternoon and welcome to our Week-End Update.
First, I want to take a moment to remember Schuylkill County Commissioner Frank Staudenmeier, who passed away last weekend. Frank was a dedicated public servant and a leader in the community. We all send our heartfelt condolences to Frank’s family, friends and all of Schuylkill County.
On Monday, I attended the AIPAC Policy Conference in Washington, the largest gathering of America’s pro-Israel community. We must always stand with Israel, our nation’s greatest ally in the Middle East, and fight back against Antisemitism in all capacities. (Pictured below with Congressman Fred Keller.)
The coronavirus is dominating the news and President Trump, Vice President Pence and Congress are making every resource available to combat this illness. I attended a White House Coronavirus Briefing with Vice President Mike Pence. The administration has implemented new travel restrictions and has sped up testing. This week, President Trump signed an $8.3 billion spending bill aimed at fighting the coronavirus outbreak that Congress sent to the White House to provide funds to federal agencies, as well as state and local governments, to battle the disease. If you are concerned that you or a loved one may be infected, please follow the CDC guidelines below.
This week, I conducted interviews on SiriusXM Patriot on The Wilkow Majority and with Newsmax to preview President Trump’s trip to Scranton and Fox News Channel Town Hall.
I traveled with President Trump on Air Force One to attend the Fox News Town Hall. The president’s message of optimism and his America First agenda continue to resonate with the people of the 9th District. President Trump’s conservative policies have re-energized what had been a stagnant economy and reversed the failed policies of previous administrations that left many Americans behind.
His leadership has led to record economic gains, including the lowest unemployment rate in half a century. After years of meager wage growth, workers are seeing their fastest wage gains in a decade and manufacturing jobs are growing at the fastest rate in more than three decades. In Pennsylvania alone, the economy has added 162,000 new jobs since 2016.
President Trump has also been a champion for our region’s energy industry. The Administration’s efforts to repeal costly regulations have ensured that family-sustaining jobs in the coal and natural gas industries will be attainable for generations to come. I look forward to continuing this important work on behalf of hardworking Pennsylvanians in Congress. (Pictured below on Air Force One, with President Trump and White House Senior Advisor Kellyanne Conway)
On Saturday, I attended the PA for Human Life Prayer Breakfast. Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon served as the special guest.
Later our campaign attended the GOP’s Stars & Stripes Gala in Montour County. Chairwoman Gunther ran an excellent event and raised over $1,000 for the Montour County Veteran’s Affairs Program. Special congratulations to Barb Fenstermaker, who won the Trump bear.
The Democratic presidential contest rolled through Super Tuesday (or ""Super Thursday"" if you are Joe Biden), and there has been considerable movement in the race as Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Mike Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the race. Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke dropped out and endorsed Joe Biden the day before Super Tuesday as the Democrat establishment is doing anything to stop Bernie Sanders. So far, their efforts have paid off as Joe Biden currently leads the race against Bernie Sanders after a strong showing on Tuesday. Below we have our political cartoon of the week, which I believe sums up the Democratic primary this week.
IN NEWS YOU WON’T READ IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA: Whether it is Bernie or Biden, one thing that won’t change is both the candidate’s desire to embrace socialist policies and a big-government agenda. The Democratic Party leadership will be working to have you believe their chosen candidate Joe Biden is moderate and a good bet for Pennsylvanians. However, his record says otherwise.
* Opposition to fracking means 600,000 jobs lost in Pennsylvania
* Wants to eliminate coal in the United States
* Supports a carbon tax and adding to the cost of fueling cars and heating our homes
* Supports criminal aliens over law enforcement and would not build a wall or secure the southern border
* Called Obama-era deportations ""a mistake""
* Put Beto O'Rourke in charge of guns after he said, ""Hell yeah, we're taking away your AR-15""
* Promises to protect and build on failed Obamacare
* Raise taxes $3.4 trillion including individual taxes
* Spends $1.7 trillion on the Green New Deal
* Opposed the raid to kill Osama Bin Laden and would not have killed Qasem Soleimani, either
* Crafted ""tough on crime"" bills for decades with misguided policies that must now be corrected
Meanwhile, let's look at President Trump's record as it pertains to the Keystone State:
* 162,000 jobs created in Pennsylvanians since 2017, unemployment has dropped 1 percentage point
* Under President Trump, 6,000 jobs added in northeastern Pennsylvania - 2,000 manufacturing jobs
* Pennsylvania's new business applications increased 21% since President Trump's election
* Pennsylvania businesses are excited for USMCA. Trade with Canada and Mexico contributes $15 billion to our economy, 40% of PA global exports
* Fracking supports 600,000 jobs in PA
* Pennsylvania ranks 2nd in natural gas production
* Pennsylvania ranks 3rd in coal production, turning out 49,883,000 tons of coal in 2018
* Sanctuary city Philadelphia's Fraternal Order of Police endorsed President Trump in 2016
The stakes for Pennsylvania and the nation could not be higher in 2020\. We must ensure Pennsylvania votes for President Trump and that Republicans win back control of the U.S. House of Representatives. The stakes are just too high.
Thank you and we will see you soon,

Good afternoon and welcome to our weekend update.
Yesterday, we celebrated Women Veterans Recognition Day and I again want to honor the brave women who have served our nation in the armed forces. Thank you for your sacrifice in defending our freedom.
As it has been dominating the news, I want to address the latest on the new policy plank adopted by the extreme left advocating for defunding the police. The left has adopted some extremely radical positions over the last few years... including a push for government-run health care, the federal government takeover of elections, no border security and the “ganGreen New Deal” that will kill tens of thousands of jobs. Still, no policy has been more radical than the push to defund law enforcement.
What occurred with Mr. George Floyd was reprehensible. Witnessing what is happening in our cities across the country is also reprehensible. While the overwhelming majority of our police officers are excellent, there is no doubt there is a need to look at reforms to improve our law enforcement through transparency, accountability and information exchange. However, burning down cities and businesses, hurting citizens and police officers, will not solve the problem but makes them a lot worse. Our law enforcement officers serve as the thin blue line that protects our communities and our families. These officers leave their homes every day not knowing if they are going to come home when their shift ends.
One of the worst scenes playing out in the nation is occurring in Seattle. Protestors have taken over a section of the city, including the illegal seizure of a police precinct. This has not allowed law enforcement to respond to the calls in a timely fashion and report to calls from citizens dealing with violent crimes, including rapes and assaults. Seattle Police have confirmed that the number of 911 calls has tripled in the occupied area since the police precinct was seized. This is lawlessness and is doing nothing to advance reforms for law enforcement.
In efforts to continue to keep our district updated on the latest happenings, I conducted a number of interviews this week. I appeared on Fox News Business to discuss the protests. Watch my interview by clicking here or below.
Additionally, I conducted an interview on Newsmax TV, where we touched on similar topics and discussed the SCAM Act, legislation I have sponsored to punish those individuals praying on our seniors and the most vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. The moderator raised the push by some in Democratic leadership, particularly Speaker Nancy Pelosi, to remove the statues of historical figures. I said that Democratic leaders should be careful assigning blame, particularly when all of the symbols they are discussing are Democrats. Granted yesteryear Democrats, as is all history. That's the point. It's history.
I am a Republican, but more importantly, I am an American that believes in our Declaration of Independence, which can be said is the 'Why' of the birth of our nation and a believer in the Constitution, which describes the 'How.' It was the Republican Party that ensured that all people are created equal and should be free. My interview can be watched by clicking here or below.
This week, Congressman Fred Keller and I visited Brian Campbell's farm in Berwick, who is participating in the new USDA Farmers to Families Food Box Program to benefit the Central PA Food Bank and the countless families they serve. This program allows the USDA to purchase up to $3 billion of fresh produce, dairy and meat products. This new program has been vital to both our agriculture partners as well as the charitable food network as we have seen over a 45% increase in demand since the beginning of the COVID crisis throughout our network.
We conducted a Zoom call with leaders in the construction industry for a status update on their activities now that they have been able to get back to work and ways we can support their efforts to hire employees and build important infrastructure for our communities.
I participated in a Veterans Affairs Committee meeting regarding the coronavirus and I want to thank the Veterans Administration for the great job they did during the Covid-19 pandemic to help support our veterans. The VA didn't just talk about following the data, they actually did it. They saw who was high risk and the factors that were contributing to those situations and focused their resources there. They have achieved excellent results supporting our veteran community during this crisis.
On Thursday, I spoke at the Carbon County Chamber's ""State of the County"" presentation at Blue Mountain Resort in Palmerton. Thank you to the many stakeholders from the private and public sectors who work hard to make Northeast PA a great place to live and work. Together, we will get through this crisis and back on a path towards prosperity. We also appreciate their ingenuity in presenting an in-person/virtual event that was safe and well-attended.
Later, I participated in a Pennsylvania Trump Team Zoom call with our new Republican nominee for Congress in the 8th District, Jim Bognet. Lastly, I want to address some news in Harrisburg. Speaker of the House Mike Turzai announced his decision to resign on June 15. Over the course of my service as the former Secretary of the Department of Revenue and now as Congressman, I was fortunate to work closely with Mike on many important issues for our Commonwealth. Mike is a leader, problem-solver and shares our conservative values. I want to thank Mike for his service and wish Mike and his family the best in their future endeavors. (Below pictured with Speaker Mike Turzai at an event last year in Berks County)
Have a great weekend, stay safe and we will see you soon.

Good afternoon and welcome to our Weekend Update.
This was a great week on the campaign trail as we work to ensure Pennsylvania delivers all 20 electoral votes to President Trump again in 2020.
On Thursday, I attended a Sportsmen for Trump Rally with Donald Trump, Jr. and Trump Victory Finance National Chair Kimberly Guilfoyle hosted by Bill and Laura Bachenberg at the Lehigh Valley Sporting Clays. The event included a rally for law enforcement and a separate rally for sportsmen. It was a tremendous event and Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle do an incredible job highlighting the countless reasons we must reelect President Trump.
One of the main reasons we back the President is his steadfast support of our Constitution and, in particular, our 2nd Amendment. I want to remind you that Joe Biden wants to put anti-2nd Amendment radical Beto O’Rourke in charge of our gun policies and Kamala Harris wants to institute a mandatory gun buyback program for the nation.
I got the opportunity to address the crowd. President Trump will win Pennsylvania again largely because he hasn't lost support from the voters and delivered for Pennsylvania the best economy we have seen in over 70 years. He did it once and he will do it again. Who would we prefer steering our economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic? Donald J. Trump or Sleepy Joe Biden? Their capabilities are about as different as shooting a bullet as opposed to throwing one. Pictured below with Donald Trump, Jr., Kimberly Guilfoyle, Brian and his wife Val Rich, my shooting buddy and good friend Chuck Coccodrilli, and my wife Shelley.
This week we attended the Schuylkill Transportation System facility groundbreaking in Saint Clair. Bob Carl, President and CEO of the Schuylkill County Chamber of Commerce, did a great job hosting the event.
This morning, we attended State Representative Doyle Heffley’s golf outing. (Pictured below).
On Sunday, I am attending the Rally at the Rock with Bradford County Commissioner Doug McLinko.
In Lebanon County, Governor Tom Wolf and the Lebanon County Commissioners agreed to a settlement with regard to appropriated CARES Act funding. First of all, I want to reiterate that I believe the Governor’s office exceeded its authority by failing to release CARES Act funding to Lebanon County. I was encouraged that our local elected officials stood up and challenged the Governor’s inconsistent orders and mandates that unfairly hurt small businesses.
Unfortunately, the settlement reached yesterday by the Governor and the County further perpetuates the unfair political attack against the residents of Lebanon County. As part of the Governor's agreement, he mandated that $2.8 million of this critical funding be used for a public relations campaign to encourage mask-wearing in Lebanon County. All of this funding was intended to help businesses open, provide assistance for our schools and support our frontline worker... They were NOT meant to be used for a public relations campaign. To siphon off $2.8 million of that critical funding on a campaign to encourage individuals to wear masks is excessive, wasteful and hurts the Lebanon County residents meant to receive this support. This Governor has proven time and time again that he favors petty politics over the interests of the hardworking people of Lebanon County. It’s a mindboggling decision made during a pandemic.
In major news, President Trump helped to negotiate a historic agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. If the media were not so fixated on defeating President Trump, they would recognize the significance of this news. The agreement will help to fully normalize relations between the two countries. This is incredible news and shows that President Trump’s diplomatic efforts in the region are having an impact. President Trump is focused on making our nation and our world a safer place. His policies and diplomacy are working.
IN NEWS YOU WON’T READ IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA: Despite what the major news outlets would have you believe, Senator Kamala Harris is not a moderate. Joe Biden’s pick for Vice President, Kamala Harris, has embraced the radical policies of the far left:
*     * Harris and Biden both support a ban and would eliminate the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania and the United States
* Harris was one of the first Democrats to co-sponsor Bernie Sanders’ single-payer Medicare for All, which would cost over $32 trillion, and said she wanted to eliminate private insurance even if individuals like their plan
* Harris is a co-sponsor of the radical Green New Deal, voted against the Trump tax cuts, and voted against a bill that would limit abortions to the first 20 weeks of pregnancy
* Harris has even said that we should have a “conversation” about whether felons should vote from prison
* Harris has endorsed the far-left’s immigration policies that are tantamount to open borders
* Harris supports sanctuary cities and said in 2018 that “we need to probably think about starting from scratch” when referring to ICE
* Harris is out of touch, using her office and personal connections to benefit herself. She ran up bills in her role as Attorney General that puts her in former Lt. Governor Mike Stack category here in Pennsylvania:
* During 2017 and 2018, Harris received “unprecedented” protection from the Los Angeles Police Department even when not in Los Angeles, costing taxpayers over $28,000
* During her 2016 campaign, Harris used campaign funds to pay for things like a stay at an upscale, $3,400 a night hotel and $20,000 on luxury car services
* Harris was more focused on playing politics than fighting crime as a prosecutor, with San Francisco’s homicide rates rising when Harris was the city’s District Attorney:
* As DA, Harris inflated the office’s conviction rate by offering plea deals to defendants accused of serious crimes
* When cases went to trial, Harris’ office underperformed compared to other prosecutors
Joe Biden's decision to select Kamala Harris as his running mate proves once again that he has completely caved to the extreme left-wing of the Democratic Party. Kamala Harris was rated the most liberal U.S. Senator in 2019, which is quite the accomplishment when you consider she is competing against the likes of Bernie Sanders, Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren. Fortunately, Biden is giving the American people a clear sign of what kind of President he would be. Radical left.
The Biden-Harris ticket has as much in common with eastern central Pennsylvania as I do with San Francisco.
Last night, I attended a Back the Blue Dinner hosted by our friend, Lebanon County District Attorney Pier Hess Graf. This was a fantastic event and the proceeds collected all went to benefit PA COPS. PA COPS provides resources to assist families and affected coworkers of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. The guest speaker was Trish Wertz. Her husband was killed in the line of duty in Berks County. Wertz is a courageous advocate for our law enforcement officers and understands the sacrifices our police and their families make to keep our communities safe. I want to thank her and Pier Hess Graf for their work to support law enforcement. Pictured below with Trish Wertz and Rep. Sue Helm.
With campaign season here, we are working on getting our message out. We have a new billboard near exit 74 on Pennsylvania Turnpike 476 (Northeast Extension). Keep American & Pennsylvania Great! Our yard signs are beginning to go up. If you need a yard sign, please contact our campaign at [[URL REDACTED]] Pictured below with Donny, Ty and Jimmy.
Yesterday, my wife and I checked our son Danny into Bucknell University. My boy is now a college man. I am very thankful that we have such great universities in Pennsylvania, so he is not too far from home. I want to wish all of our students, their parents and families well as we safely get back to school during these challenging times.
Please have a great weekend and we will see you soon.

Alex --
Good afternoon and welcome to our Week-End Update.
The acquittal of President Donald Trump, the State of the Union Address, the Iowa Caucuses…there was no shortage of significant events to discuss this week.
The U.S. Senate voted down the impeachment on Wednesday. This mercifully ends what has been a baseless and reckless witch hunt led by Democratic Leadership, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Congressmen Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. This was such a stinging defeat for the Democratic leadership, and even the Washington Post was forced to finally print the truth about President Donald Trump – a headline that reads “Trump Acquitted.”
Our Founding Fathers never meant to have impeachment weaponized like it was by Democratic leadership over the past few months. In response, U.S. Senator Rick Scott has sponsored a Congressional Amendment to raise the threshold in the U.S. House for impeachment. I support this effort as we can never allow impeachment to be used as a political tool ever again.
Since gaining the majority in 2018, the House Democrat majority has obsessed overdoing one thing: impeaching a President despite the absence of evidence. Their purely political agenda consumed precious taxpayer money and distracted Congress from doing the work of the people.
As the Democratic Party mourned the death of the impeachment sham, the President’s State of the Union address highlighted the strength of our nation. The President detailed the dramatic results of his policies over the last three years and articulated an optimistic and ambitious agenda for 2020 and our country this decade. Pro-growth policies have created a booming economy, our military is stronger and more prepared than any time in our nation’s history, and we are beginning to see the results of our efforts to curb drug overdoses, as the rate of deaths has declined for the first time in decades. These are real results and prime examples of where President Trump has disproved conventional wisdom and set our country on a path to Make Our America Even Greater. (Pictured below with the President, high-fiving Congressman Mark Meadows and with colleagues)
I interviewed with WFMZ. Click the link below to watch my interview.
Unfortunately, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and most of the Democratic Caucus sat on their hands as President Trump outlined the success of our nation. Speaker Pelosi then went even farther by deliberately tearing the President’s State of the Union Address apart on national television. It happened no less than 25 feet in front of where I was sitting.
Pelosi's actions were unbecoming of the Speaker of the House and, frankly, for an adult. No adult finds such juvenile behavior admirable, only destructive. In doing this, Speaker Pelosi violated House Rules, so today House Republicans brought a resolution admonishing her actions to the floor. Sadly, every Democrat member voted to block, allowing debate on this resolution. If the United States Congress cannot hold this sort of divisive behavior accountable, how can the American people trust Democrat leadership? Obviously, they cannot.
To me, her actions served as a clear declaration that Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leadership have no desire or intentions to try to work together on anything.
Over the past three days, I have traveled around the District attending over half a dozen events and never before I have I seen such an agitation with so many people upset about Speaker Pelosi tearing up President Trump's speech. I have had dozens, including many Democrats, approach me with their heads shaking, saying her behavior was unacceptable and terrible. Every one of them are convinced she needs to go and the only way to accomplish that goal is to get her out is for Republicans to win back the House.
This week, our country became safer as our armed forces successfully took out another dangerous terrorist. On Thursday, the White House announced that Qassim al-Rimi, leader of the terror group, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, was killed in an airstrike in Yemen.  Al-Rimi was a founder of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and has taken responsibility for the deaths of countless. Additionally, he took credit for last year’s deadly shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola, where a Saudi aviation trainee killed three American sailors. The world is a much safer place without al-Rimi.
This week, the primary race for the Democratic nomination for President began in Iowa. However, just like each Democratic presidential debate, it began and ended in disaster. First, the Iowa Democratic Party has been unable to get an accurate count. The Associated Press has announced that they failed to declare a winner of Iowa’s Democratic caucuses because of irregularities in the process. Like the 2016 election, I assume they will challenge the outcome of this election as well. In fact, we heard the Iowa Democratic Party even attempted to get an expert, Count von Count from Sesame Street, to come in to assist in the tally. (See below)
In all seriousness, the Democratic Presidential contest has been an embarrassment… not because of a failed count or the debate rules, but because of their failed socialist policy ideas.
In News You Won’t Hear In The Mainstream Media: Under President Trump’s leadership, our nation is on a roll. Please don’t take it from me… listen to the voters.
* Americans’ economic optimism just hit a record 44-year high—better than under Presidents Reagan, Clinton, or Obama. That confidence is buoyed by an unemployment rate near 50-year lows, a record stock market, and plummeting income inequality as blue-collar wage gains outpace white-collar ones.
* More people are satisfied with how things are going in the United States than at any point in the past 15 years. Besides the soaring economy, violent crime rates are down, and American strength grows as terror leaders are brought to justice.
* A record-breaking 90 percent of Americans are satisfied with their personal life. “It's likely no coincidence that Americans' heightened satisfaction with their personal life comes as confidence in the U.S. economy and their personal finances are also at long-term or record highs,” Gallup writes.
To top it off: While Democrat leaders fume and rip up speeches, the rest of the country is giving President Trump his highest approval rating yet.

By contrast, watch this clip from a New Hampshire father schooling Democratic Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren on her plan to eliminate student loans.
He rightfully asked why those who do the right things, like saving for their children’s education, will have to subsidize another parent who didn’t. Warren has no answer because this socialist policy, like all of them, is wrongheaded and unfair.
This week, on Monday, I conducted a radio interview on WPPA's Step up to the Mic in Pottsville. On Tuesday, I attended Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf's budget address, where I was able to catch up with many friends in Harrisburg. On Thursday, I attended President Trump's speech at the National Prayer Breakfast.
This week, I sponsored legislation, H.R. 5761, the Advancing Uniform Transportation Opportunities for Veterans (AUTO) Act. This bill will increase access to the Department of Veterans Affairs Automobile Grant. Qualifying veterans could receive a second grant ten years after receiving the first grant. Currently, veterans are only able to receive the grant once-per-lifetime. These brave men and women sacrificed much in defense of our nation and we owe it to them to do everything in our power to provide them with the services they need now.
Report from the Campaign Trail:
Last Sunday, I attended the Southern Luzerne 1st District Republican Brunch in Hazleton. I want to thank our good friend State Representative Tarah Toohil, for inviting us to speak. I want to congratulate Frances Petrovich, who was honored as the Distinguished Republican of the Year. (Pictured below)
We attended a Women for Trump event with Vice President Mike Pence in Cumberland County. This event illustrated the great enthusiasm that exists around the Commonwealth for the Trump Campaign. People are pumped and ready to get to work to get President Trump and Pence reelected. We can accomplish that almost singlehandedly by ensuring Pennsylvania goes Red in 2020.
As you know, I am running for reelection this year, and our campaign is right in the middle of petition collection. My campaign must secure a minimum of 1,000 signatures. Our goal is to submit many more signatures than are required. Our team has and continues to be on the trail, working to collect as many signatures as possible.
Yesterday, I served as the keynote speaker at the Northampton County GOP Annual Lincoln Day Breakfast this morning. The crowd was enthusiastic and ready to help reelect President Trump and win back control of the U.S. House in 2020. (Pictured below with the Northampton GOP leadership and members)
Our team attended the Luzerne County Republican Lincoln Day Breakfast.
Yesterday afternoon, we attended the Pottsville Winterfest. (Pictures below with supporters including our good friend Ron Downey)
We closed out yesterday at a petition signing event with State Representative Karen Boback at the home of Tom and Andrea Mosca. Thanks to all for hosting and for the countless who have signed petitions.
Today, we are with State Representative Doyle Heffley and other local candidates for a Support Team Trump To Keep America Great petition signing event in Primary Campaign Office in Lehighton.
As a reminder, as this is an election year, we have begun circulating petitions to run for reelection to Congress. Petition circulation concludes on February 17. If you would like to join our team, please let us know. For copies of petitions, questions or information regarding petition events across the District or to arrange petition pick-up, please contact our Field Campaign Manager Rob Bresnahan at [[URL REDACTED]]

Alex \--
Good evening and welcome to our Weekend Update.
Campaign stops, town halls, confirmation hearings, special events, farm tours, a police ride-along and much more were all packed into a very busy week.
Today, we welcomed Vice President Mike Pence to the 9th Congressional District at the Reading Regional Airport.
Before the Vice President arrived, I was able to address the crowd and let them know why I believe President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are going to win Pennsylvania again. We need them to Make America Great Again... Again. Click here or below to watch my remarks.
The Vice President was tremendous. He spoke about the America First agenda and the countless successes the Administration has accomplished over the last four years, including helping to build one of the greatest economies our nation has ever witnessed. He also spoke about the stark choice Americans face on Election Day. The Harris-Biden ticket is running on the most extreme left-wing agenda in the history of our nation. Higher taxes, banning fracking, packing the courts, open borders, government-run health care... their liberal wishlist goes on and on. It is critical that everyone turn out and vote for President Trump and Vice President Pence and help us deliver a Republican-led majority to the U.S. House. The future prosperity of our nation hinges on the results of November 3. Don't take my word for it, listen to the Vice President by clicking here or on the picture below.
We were joined by so many friends, including Pennsylvania Trump-Pence Chair Bernie Comfort. (Pictured below)
As well as my friends, fellow Congressman Lloyd Smucker and Berks County Commissioner Christian Leinbach. (Pictured below)
In the U.S. Senate, confirmation hearings on Judge Amy Coney Barrett began. Fighting off ridiculous attacks from Democrat Senators, Judge Barrett showed why President Trump nominated her to the Supreme Court. She has the judicial temperament, experience and qualifications to serve our nation on our highest court. She will interpret the laws and follow the U.S. Constitution. I believe she will make an excellent addition to the U.S. Supreme Court.
On Thursday night, we witnessed two very different town halls play out on national television. President Donald Trump conducted a town hall in primetime on NBC where he faced tough questions on the major issues facing our nation. While the debate was canceled, it was clear that NBC planned to have Savannah Guthrie “stand-in” for Joe Biden. While she attacked the President, he didn't back down. He answered how his administration has advanced the America First Agenda while tackling tough issues like Covid-19 and illegal immigration.
Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden held a town hall primetime on ABC with George Propagandopolis. What did the American people get? Softball questions and lies. Zero questions about his son Hunter Biden’s involvement with being paid large sums of money from foreign emissaries to arrange meetings with his father who was serving as the Vice President at the time.
Despite not having to answer the difficult questions, Biden still shamelessly lied about his record… over and over again.
IN NEWS YOU WON’T HEAR IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA: Joe Biden used his national platform to lie and misrepresent his positions multiple times…
He lied about the:
* Vaccine \- Joe said a vaccine won’t be ready until next year. The truth is that the CDC and Dr. Fauci said a vaccine is possible by the end of the year.
* Raising Taxes \- Joe said that anyone making less than $400,000 a year won’t see a tax increase under his plan. The truth is that Biden’s $4 trillion tax hike will raise taxes on 82% of Americans, including those making under $400,000.
* Crime Bill \- Joe said the crime bill does not have mandatory sentences. The truth is that the Crime Bill Biden authored included a “three strikes” provision that led to mandatory life sentences.
* Fracking \- Joe said he would not ban fracking. The truth is that Biden repeatedly expressed his support for banning fracking and eliminating the fossil fuel industry.
To highlight Joe’s problems with the truth, our campaign has put together the following video of clips of his contradictions and lies. This is evidence that deserves a verdict. Please click here or below to watch.
On Monday, I joined the Bloomsburg Police Chief Roger Van Loan for a ride-along during his patrol in Bloomsburg. I also had the opportunity to tour the Bloomsburg police station and meet with members of the department. Thank you to our brave men and women in blue who keep our communities safe!
Earlier this week, I appeared on the Sam Lesante Show (Pictured Below) and conducted an interview with the Citizens’ Voice editorial board. We will post each of those interviews when they are made public.
I appeared on Fox Business’s Varney & Co. to discuss the negative impact of the Biden-Harris economic agenda, Biden’s plans to pack the courts and why I believe President Trump will win Pennsylvania again. Click here or below to watch my interview.
On Thursday, I traveled to Shamokin to join State Rep. Kurt Masser for a lunch with local veterans. As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee in Congress, I am dedicated to ensuring that those who have served our nation receive the care and benefits they have earned.
One thing that I particularly enjoy is visiting with all my close friends at the various county party GOP fall dinners throughout the District and Commonwealth. On Tuesday, I spoke at the Berks County GOP Dinner. I want to thank Chairman Clay Breece and the members and supporters of the Berks County GOP for attending. We must ensure Berks County goes Red this year for President Trump.
On Wednesday, I joined my friend and former White House Press Secretary and Communications Director Sean Spicer at the Lebanon County Republican Fall Dinner. Sean delivered an insider view of President Trump. Each guest also got a copy of Sean’s new book, Leading America, President Trump’s Commitment to People, Patriotism and Capitalism. I would encourage everyone to check out that book. Chairman Ed Lynch and the Lebanon County Republican Committee hosted a wonderful event.
On Thursday, I met up with Vice President Pence’s nephew John Pence in Schuylkill County. Another tremendous event. The excitement and energy continue to build for the Trump-Pence ticket.
Later that evening, we held a tremendously successful fundraiser in Luzerne County. I want to thank everyone who supported our campaign, especially our many hosts.
This week, I received the Friend of Farm Bureau Award from the American Farm Bureau Federation. Agriculture is one of the leading industries in Pennsylvania, providing thousands of family-sustaining jobs. Yesterday, we visited a number of family farms across the District. At each stop, we toured their facilities and conducted a roundtable discussion on the various issues impacting the agricultural industry. In Congress, I will continue to work for our farmers, ensuring a future filled with increased opportunity and prosperity for those who help feed America. We began our day with a stop at the J.C. Hill Tree Farm in Orwigsburg with owner Jeff Hill. At our second stop, we joined William Palmer at the WT Palmer and Son Beef Farm in Shartlesville. Our final stop was at Carl Weidler’s Dairy in Palmyra.
I want to thank all of our farm families for the work they do and for hosting these important roundtables today. Having an open line of communication and discussing these critically important issues helps to guide me as we make decisions in Washington to support our agricultural industry. I would like also to send out a special thanks to Mike Firestine, Chairman of the Pennsylvania AG Republicans for joining us on the tour as well as for his continued support, counsel and friendship.
As part of our efforts to reach out to voters prior to Election Day, we conducted candidate interviews on many of the local news stations. Click here or below to watch my interview on CBS-21.
Click here or below to watch my candidate interview on Fox 43.
Our campaign also announced that we received the endorsement of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Last but not least, earlier this year, I stood with Taste of Sicily in Palmyra who opened their doors in defiance of the Governor’s Covid-19 restrictions. Today, they successfully fought back against the excessive fines imposed on them by the government and won. A Judge found Taste of Sicily NOT GUILTY and they do not have to pay any of the ridiculous fines.
I fully support efforts to keep people safe, but the government should not force a small business to choose between operating safely to support your family or closing your doors forever.
The liberties guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution are not fair-weather liberties. They exist during good times and challenging times.

Corky Greets President Trump, Gets Shout-Out from the Commander-in-Chief
Alternate text
Corky was among hundreds of enthusiastic Granite Staters Friday night at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport when President Donald Trump touched down in Air Force One. With the presidential plane as his backdrop, the President spoke at length about the issues facing the nation. He was at times jocular and often serious, as he blasted his Democrat opponent, Joe Biden, and predicted a Trump win in November.
During his speech, he made special mention of Corky and his run for U.S. Senate, pointing to Corky in the crowd and telling him, “I heard you’re doing well, Corky!” Here’s the moment!
Alternate text
Before the President’s arrival, Corky spoke to the assembled crowd, saying how honored he was to be among those greeting the President. He also recounted the story of the day Mr. Trump endorsed his Senate run, and then the next day, the President was at West Point, congratulating Corky’s elder son, who was among the graduating cadets. “It was a special 24 hours for the Messner family,” he said, continuing, “and the way we’re going to thank President Trump for this endorsement is twofold: we are going to retire Jeanne Shaheen and retire her to her home to York, Maine…And we’re going to help President Trump win the four electoral votes in New Hampshire.”
WMUR-Channel 9 U.S. Senate Debate Airs Sept. 1
Alternate text
Be sure to tune in as WMUR-Channel 9 airs a debate featuring Republican U.S. Senate candidates Corky Messner and Don Bolduc, Tuesday, Sept. 1, at 7 p.m. The two canddidates will discuss the issues facing New Hampshire and the nation, and their efforts to unseat incumbent Senator Jeanne Shaheen.
Corky is the Only Candidate for Federal Office Recommended by New Hampshire's Liberty Ballot
Corky Messner is the only candidate for federal office this election year recommended by Liberty Ballot, a New Hampshire organization which supports candidates who champion small government.
Alternate text
“I am honored to be recommended by Liberty Ballot,” says Corky. “This group is dedicated to the idea of small government and self-determination and believes as I do in individual liberty and economic freedom for all Americans. I also am grateful for the support from these State Representatives and other loyal Republicans.”
Liberty Ballot evaluates candidates based on their small government stance and their viability. Those candidates are indicated by a marked ballot on the Liberty Ballot website, which lists ballots by city and town. For example, a Goffstown resident accessing the sample ballot on the Liberty Ballot site will see Corky selected, along with several other candidates.
The evaluation process includes dozens of activists who research ratings, endorsements, and pledges from organizations that include the New Hampshire Liberty Alliance, the Republican Liberty Caucus of New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Firearms Coalition, Gun Owners of New Hampshire, Americans for Prosperity New Hampshire, and New Hampshire Families for Education.
Candidate debates, websites, Facebook pages, literature and interviews also are considered as part of the evaluation process. Additionally, candidate viability is considered.
The Violence Must End, Says Corky, As Senator Paul is Attacked Outside the White House
Commenting on the video showing Kentucky U.S. Senator Rand Paul and his wife being threatened by a mob after leaving the White House the evening of President Trump’s acceptance speech, Corky strongly condemned the continuing unrest and violence in our cities.
Corky was endorsed by Senator Paul a few weeks ago.
“Minneapolis. Portland. Seattle. Washington. How long will the radical left continue to support rioters burning cities to the ground?” asks Corky. “Defunding the police is the LAST thing our communities need right now. They need security, protection, and safety. Not lawlessness and crime.”
He added: “President Trump is working hard to get these mobs under control, but politicians like D.C. Jeanne Shaheen, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer are blocking him at every turn. We cannot allow Senator Shaheen perpetuate the violence and lawlessness across the country any longer.”
More State Representatives and GOP Activists Sign on as Messner Endorsers
Last week, we welcomed a new round of endorsements from State Representatives and noted GOP activists.
Alternate text
They include State Representatives Joe Alexander, Tom Dolan, Tony Lekas, Charlie McMahon, Mark Pearson, Steve Pearson, and Michael Yakobovich. Longtime GOP supporters endorsing Messner include former President of New Hampshire Right to Life Jane Cormier, Trump supporter Chau Kelley of Hooksett, and former N.H. House candidate Tommy Sharpe, Sr. of Windham.
""Having a Senator in Washington who will defend life and liberty is absolutely vital to the future of our Granite State,"" says Cormier. ""Corky Messner will have my vote, and I hope he will have others' as well.""
“I welcome this support as we approach the Sept. 8 primary, and we continue on to face Jeanne Shaheen in November’s general election,” Corky responded “Republicans across the Granite State understand this is a critical contest as we work to return conservative values and common sense to Washington.”

President Trump Endorses Corky Messner’s Run for the U.S. Senate
Alternate text
President Donald Trump has endorsed Corky Messner’s run for the U.S. Senate.
“Corky Messner will be a fantastic Senator for New Hampshire,” says President Trump. “A West Point graduate, he served our country in the Army with distinction. Strong on jobs, crime, veterans, and the Second Amendment. Corky has my complete and total endorsement!”
“I am humbled by the President’s support, and I will provide Granite Staters with the conservative voice they need in the U.S. Senate,” says Corky. “Career politician Jeanne Shaheen has lost touch with the everyday concerns and values of New Hampshire residents, and they can trust me to provide the leadership they need to face the challenges ahead.”
Corky Messner Unveils Plan with a Goal of “Unleashing the Strength of America”
This week, Corky unveiled a blueprint to restore America’s economic prosperity and manufacturing might, preserve individual liberties, and reduce government intrusion and over-regulation.
Alternate text
The Messner USA Plan: Unleashing the Strength of America focuses on three main areas: economic freedom, national security, and individual liberty. You can read the plan on our website.
“We can unleash this nation’s strength, and restore our standing in the world, if we work toward providing economic opportunities and restoring personal liberties for every American,” says Corky, who adds that he stands ready to work with New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu and President Trump “to reignite our American economy, by providing the leadership and the vision we need to move ahead.
“We can emerge from this pandemic, and from these times of social unrest and divisiveness, stronger as a people and as a country. What we need is a common mission and the common sense to restore the United States of America’s standing as a nation that is the envy of the world.”

Super PAC Will Support Messner Campaign
As WMUR reported this week, the Freedom and Liberty PAC, led by a team of veteran GOP strategists, will work to “ensure Corky Messner wins the primary election in September and defeats Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in November,” according to a statement shared exclusively with WMUR’s New Hampshire Primary Source. The group says it has “already received pledges in the six-figures.”

Alex,
Did you hear about the anarchy in Washington following President Trump's RNC speech?
The radical left decided to riot... and ATTACKED Sen. Rand Paul in the streets.
It's hard to believe that they had the nerve to attack a sitting Senator, but you can see for yourself! Watch the video here.

Sen. Rand Paul ATTACKED! Click to Watch.
Minneapolis. Portland. Seattle. Washington. How long will the radical left continue to support rioters burning cities to the ground?
Defunding the police is the LAST thing our communities need right now. They need security, protection, and safety. Not lawlessness and crime.
President Trump is working hard to get these mobs under control, but politicians like D.C. Jeanne Shaheen, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer are blocking him at every turn.
Don't let Shaheen perpetuate the violence and lawlessness across the country any longer. Contribute now to help Corky DEFEAT her, and be an ally for President Trump.

273,"Over the last two weeks, a string of anti-Semitic attacks have shown - we must do more to end hate crimes.
Carolyn Maloney for Congress Logo
Hello,
In the past two weeks, we’ve heard deeply upsetting reports of violent, anti-Semitic attacks almost every day. This is not what New York City or our country is about. Each and every one of us has a role in stopping this hate-fueled violence -- we need to show future generations and one another that we will have zero tolerance for the harm and hurt that comes from hate.
Tomorrow, Sunday, I’ll join with thousands of New Yorkers in Foley Square to march in solidarity with our Jewish community; I hope you can attend a march close to you. This is a time when we must stand together against hate.
And when Congress resumes, I’ll keep fighting to pass my Never Again Education Act, which would fund education on the Holocaust, genocide, and tolerance, and create resources that teachers across the country can use to teach our youth the evils of hatred and bigotry. With 297 co-sponsors, I hope this bill will soon pass the House.
Please join me in sponsoring this important bill, and helping end anti-Semitic violence. Sign your name to support the Never Again Education Act. >>

Carolyn Maloney for Congress
Hate is not something that people are born with. It is taught and learned.
But so is compassion. Education plays a vital role in shaping our future generations and ensuring history’s darkest moments don’t repeat.
That’s why I introduced the Never Again Education Act last year — to provide funding and resources to ensure comprehensive Holocaust education programs in our schools. By teaching children where hate and intolerance lead, we can ensure that we Never Again see these horrors visited on our friends and neighbors because of who they are, what they look like, or what they believe.
The bill already has 47 sponsors, but we must continue to build support in order to get it passed. Sign your name now to urge your Senator to co-sponsor the Never Again Education Act.
ADD YOUR NAME
In the last year, anti-Semitic hate crimes have reached record highs. Every day, we are seeing a spike in discriminatory rhetoric and crimes stemmed from hate and prejudice. If we are to stop cruel acts of violence and extremist beliefs, we must instill humanity in our youth. This cannot wait.
Please stand with me in promoting acceptance and tolerance in our schools through Holocaust education. Sign your name now to support the Never Education Act to help prevent the rise of hatred.

Carolyn Maloney for Congress
Happy Valentine's Day!
I’m John Blasco, a district leader on New York City’s Lower East Side. As you know, the Trump administration has worked to discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community — a community I’m part of, and fight for, every day.
That’s why I’m glad we have an ally like Carolyn Maloney in Congress. From her days on the New York City Council, introducing New York State’s first anti-LGBTQ+-discrimination legislation to becoming a member of the Congressional LGBTQ Equality Caucus, Carolyn has been at the forefront of advocating for full rights and equal protection of those who are vulnerable to bias based on their gender identity or sexual orientation.
In Congress, she’s led the effort for inclusive universal paid family leave and was a staunch advocate for our rights during the fight for marriage equality. She’s spoken out against the Trump administration’s ban on trans soldiers in the military, and as the chair of Oversight, she’s fighting for people like Chin Mei Tsui, a trans immigrant who’s spent the last 20 months in solitary confinement — despite never committing a crime.
The LGBTQ+ community needs Carolyn to stay in Congress and keep fighting for our rights. This Valentine's Day, please pitch in $2.14 now to help Carolyn fight against Trump’s anti-LGBTQ+ agenda.
If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will process automatically:
PITCH IN $2.14
This year, thanks to pressure from William Barr’s Department of Justice, the Supreme Court will decide if employers can discriminate based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
Carolyn introduced the Equality Act to make sure that it can’t happen. “No one should be fired from their job or lose their home because of who they are or who they love,” she said. And she’s right.
We've already seen Carolyn deliver when it comes to championing for equal rights — so when it comes to ending the Trump administration’s war on the LGBTQ+ community, we know she has our back.

278,"The Equality Act is crucial to ending LGBTQ+ discrimination
Carolyn Maloney for Congress
Alex,
Pride Month this year came with a landmark victory when the Supreme Court ruled to bar employer discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals a few weeks ago. But in this month of celebration and appreciation for the LGBTQ+ community, we've also seen that there is still so much work to be done in the fight for equality.
The FDA continues to hold discriminatory blanket deferrals on blood donations. Anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes have persisted, particularly on transwomen of color. And on the 4 year anniversary of the Orlando Pulse Nightclub shooting, the president moved to allow healthcare providers to deny treatment to transgender patients.
Pride Month may be over, but the fight for LGBTQ+ equality is not.
I will continue to fight for protections for the LGBTQ+ community — not only in the workplace and healthcare but in all parts of American society until we have guaranteed that basic civil rights are not determined by sexual orientation or gender identity.
Today, I'm asking for your support in urging the Senate to pass The Equality Act — so that LGBTQ+ protections are universal and these individuals are guaranteed the human rights, dignity, and respect they deserve. ADD YOUR NAME NOW TO BECOME A CITIZEN CO-SPONSOR >>
Pride Equality Act Button
The Equality Act would expand nondiscrimination protections to healthcare, housing, credit, education, public spaces and services, and more. It is critical that we wholeheartedly support this effort to ensure the equality for the LGBTQ+ community that we’ve fought so long for.
The LGBTQ+ community will remain vulnerable to discrimination until we take legislative action to counter attacks from Trump and far-right challengers.

Cristina for Texas
Since the murder of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis Police, we have seen unprecedented protests across the country in defense of Black lives and a seismic shift in public opinion. Now is the time for structural change to address institutionalized racism, and, in Texas, we have a special role to play in this struggle.
Texas has the largest Black population in America and the largest prison population. The crisis is critical in Texas because the incarceration rate for Black people in Texas is 63% higher than the national incarceration rate for Black Americans. We can be - and need to be - the leader in the (long overdue) reform of our fundamentally racist criminal (in)justice system in this country, that is why I am asking that you consider giving to:
* Austin Justice Coalition
* Texas Civil Rights Project
* Texas Organizing Project
As a senate candidate, I endorsed Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s (D-MA) criminal justice reform legislation: The People’s Justice Guarantee (H. Res. 702), which calls for abolishing the death penalty and life sentences without parole, ending solitary confinement, capping sentences for all crimes, decriminalizing consenual sex work, ending the cash bail system, prohibiting private companies from profiting off of incarceration and immigrant detention, de-militarizing the police, limiting firearm productions and sales, and many other common sense measures that would dismantle injustices so that the system is smaller, safer, less punitive, and more humane.
I urge you to support Pressley (she’s up for reelection in November) and her legislation by contacting your representatives and telling them you support The People’s Justice Guarantee. Vote for pregressive candidates that support shrinking and reforming our criminal justice system during the primary run-offs this summer (July 14, in Texas) and elections this November.
We can create change at the ballot box and in the streets. Across the country people are reimagining what our policing and justice system can become. I believe we can reimagine our current justice system. One where our communities are safe, where the lives and families of Black Americans are treated with the full respect and dignity all people deserve, where we prioritize investment in our schools, mental health, addiction and treatment, affordable housing and homeless services to address the real needs of communities and to stop a cycle of criminalization of poverty and the disproportionate impacts on communities of color.

# Cristina for Texas
Yesterday I endorsed Ayanna Pressley’s bold criminal justice reform plan: The People’s Justice Guarantee.
In Texas — a state where more than 200,000 people are behind bars — we know how dire and broken our criminal justice system is. We’re the state that led the movement to be tough on crime. We’re the state that has one of the highest incarceration rates. We’re the state that has most recently been in the headlines regarding the use of the death penalty.
That’s why I know that if we want to overhaul our criminal justice system, it needs to start in Texas.
Will you send me to the Senate so I can help Ayanna fight for the People’s Justice Guarantee? Please chip in $5 to our grassroots campaign, we have less than 40 days until early voting starts!
CONTRIBUTE $5
I’m a child that grew up in the ’90s. I was born in 1982, so I remember growing up in the time period when our whole nation was focused on “lock them up and throw away the key.”
Today, I now know that the way we built our system is to disproportionately lock up people that are poor and people of color. Unless we address this inequality, we can never have justice.
There’s been discussions, especially in Texas, about how to reform criminal justice, but it’s been around the margins and edges. None have really gotten to how to make a criminal justice system that is community-based and that tackles the systemic problems that exist today.
Ayanna’s plan is one of the first platforms that tries to get at that — and that’s why I’m endorsing it.
If you agree with Ayanna and I that it’s time for an overhaul to our criminal justice system, will you please support my people-powered campaign today?

# Join the Political Revolution!
Alex,
We are facing a public health crisis in our country.
Opioids are wreaking havoc on our communities.
Every 15 minutes, a baby is born with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome because of opioid use during pregnancy. Since the late 1990s, more than 400,000 Americans have been killed by opioid overdoses.
We can trace this epidemic to the lies and greed of the pharmaceutical industry, and ultimately our for-profit healthcare industry.
Will you join me in the fight against opioids?
Prescription opioids were introduced in the 90’s, the drug manufacturers knew then they were addictive, potentially deadly, and less than effective for long-term pain relief. Nevertheless, Big Pharma lobbied lawmakers, aggressively marketed, and pressured doctors to prescribe more and more opioids.
Thirty years later we are still fighting opioids.
The infamous 1994 crime bill, supported by Frank Pallone, was one of the many misguided tools for addressing substance abuse. With the passage of that bill, our government disproportionally targeting young, black men, resulting in hundreds of thousands of incarcerations and providing little to no impact on the public health crisis that it was supposed to address.
Let us not repeat those mistakes.
Instead, compassionate policies like Medicare for All, are the new goal. Medicare for All will cover mental health services, ensuring that anyone who struggles with addiction can get the help that they need.
Now is time to hold the pharmaceutical companies accountable for the very real damage that they have caused and provide life-saving, readily accessible treatment to anyone who needs it.
I pledge to fight for these priorities from the moment I am sworn in. We're running a grassroots campaign, completely for the people and by the people, any donation is huge
Pitch in any amount today and let’s stop the opioid crisis together.
In Solidarity,
P.S. Don't forget to vote on June 2. Every vote for me is a vote for us!

283,"America’s unfulfilled promises of equal treatment are all around us.
Friends,
Last week, Congressional Rep. Al Green (D-TX) called on every single candidate for office to lay out their plans for racial justice. He said: “We ought to demand that the people running for public office make public statements about how they plan to end invidious discrimination… No candidate should be off limits. Every one of them ought to have to tell us what they plan to do.”
On Saturday, I marched in Newark for George Floyd, and for every black life cut short by police brutality and systemic racism. But as Rep. Green said, that is not enough. Every candidate, including the 32-year incumbent who I’m challenging in the July 7 Democratic primary and who voted for the 1994 Crime Bill, should publicly state what measures they support for racial justice.
Since I announced my candidacy, I’ve laid out a bold platform calling for racial justice. America has a long and continuing history of racial discrimination, and I plan on working to end it in Congress.
Our government must repair the damage that’s been done in the past, and also must ensure racial justice and equality for all for the future. I pledge to make that happen in Congress. Here’s how:
‍
Housing:
The long history of red-lining and racism in real estate agencies and the banking industry has created a present-day reality of segregation in our communities. Racist housing policies have limited our diversification and have hindered the celebration of both our differences and common bonds.
‍The division of our communities by race is another attempt by those with power to maintain an unjust status quo.
When highways, fences and even streets divide us, our collective power is suppressed, just as slave revolts and racial justice were suppressed by turning poor white people against enslaved black people in the 1800s.
We must desegregate our communities while preventing gentrification. This will be a tricky balancing act, but several actions can be taken to make it possible. We can start by narrowing the racial wealth gap through economic policies like a wealth tax, a more progressive income tax, a $20/hour minimum wage, and reinforcement of the estate tax. Vitally, we can reduce dependency on property taxes for local budgets. We must also enact rent stabilization and construct thousands of new mixed-income units. Finally, we should put our money where our mouth is and invest in POC-owned businesses.
‍Employment:
‍As blind auditions diversified bands and orchestras decades ago, so too can blind job interviews and anonymized applications avoid the (un)conscious racism of so many hiring managers and diversify our workforce. We must also eliminate the racial pay gap, something strong unions and universal access to higher education can help accomplish.
Police Brutality:
Police departments throughout US history have been harnessed as tools of racism and violent suppression of communities of color. We can, and must, take solid steps to end that abuse of power.
First, we can improve vetting procedures and mandate zero-tolerance policies for police officers found in violation of use-of-force guidelines and civil liberty protections. Second, we can classify weapons and equipment as civilian-grade, police-grade, and military-grade, and prohibit the use of military grade items by police. Third, we can follow the model of many other countries and train our officers to verbally deescalate confrontations and contact appropriate social workers to address certain situations. Fourth, we can mandate the use of body cameras by all police officers and the addition of numerous cameras to police vehicles to provide clearer accounts of how use-of-force incidents proceed.
Reparations:
Two and a half centuries of chattel slavery destroyed countless lives, nearly tore apart the country, and has continued to impact our nation. I support the creation of a special committee in the House to study and produce recommendations for direct, monetary reparations for descendants of enslaved Americans. Affirmative policies will also start to undo hundreds of years of violence.
‍
Education:
‍We must fully fund education at the federal level, ending the injustice of our zip codes determining our quality of education. We must also allow students to attend public colleges and universities without owing a dime. Finally, we must provide universal childcare and pre-K, as the earliest years of a child’s life are key to future academic and career success. These policies will offset the effect of the racial wealth gap, which privileges white communities.
Politics:
In 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, the most comprehensive defense of democracy ever legislated. It took aim at racist voting laws like poll taxes and literacy tests that had been used to suppress the black vote. Crucially, it also mandated federal oversight of jurisdictions that had particularly abhorrent records of racist voting laws.
Yet in 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that the formula used to determine which districts qualified for federal oversight was outdated, and thus unconstitutional. However, the court did not reject the concept of federal oversight of specific jurisdictions. It simply asked Congress to rewrite the formula to reflect current realities. It is time Congress do just that--and go further.
Voter ID laws must be outlawed, as must voter roll purges. Polling locations must be allocated based on eligible voter populations, not on the whims of state and county election officials.
Institutionalized racism disfranchises the groups that understand its effects best and whose voices in power would go the furthest in dismantling it. We can begin to end that self-perpetuating cycle by restoring and upgrading the Voting Rights Act.
‍
* * * * *
I cannot live the lives of marginalized groups in America, but I can educate myself about our country’s history of racism. I can understand that the Newark water crisis would not be happening in Maplewood, that the drive up the hill from Orange to South Orange is a lesson in redlining.
We pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic, for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Despite that pledge, which we have all taken, too many of us fail to uphold its commandments. Liberty and Justice for All. Derek Chauvin and his accomplices, George Floyd’s murderers, decided they could ignore that pledge.
The same decision has been made by police officers across the country as they have ruthlessly cut short black lives. It has been made by white supremacist terrorists like Dylann Roof (Emmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church), Patrick Crusius (El Paso Walmart), and Gregory and Travis McMichael (Ahmaud Arbery’s murderers).
The struggle against this violent, deadly racism cannot cease.
At the same time, we must look deeper than the most blatant, gruesome acts of racism and realize that America’s unfulfilled promises of equal treatment are all around us. From housing, to education, to employment, to politics, to the carceral system, our nation perpetuates racial injustice in every part of life.
My opponent has been in Congress for over 30 years, watching as the racial wealth gap has grown and grown and families of color have been priced out of their communities, as police shootings of black men have continued and as the war on crime has racistly ripped apart families of color.
I am running for Congress to fight for all, and especially for those who have been left out of the conversation for centuries.

Sanford Bishop for Congress
Good morning, Alex –
I want to share some updates with you from Congress and across our nation. Here are three things you need to know:
1. This week’s primary election demonstrated the need for stronger voter protections in Georgia: people waited in line to vote for hours, voting machines malfunctioned, some requested absentee ballots did not arrive, and the threat of COVID-19 forced many to make the impossible choice between their health and their right to vote. I am launching a petition to demand stronger voter protections – sign on here →
2. I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 7120, the Justice in Policing Act. This bold piece of legislation is a collaborative effort between my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus and the House Judiciary Committee, and includes common-sense community protections like mandating police body cameras, eliminating chokeholds, and strengthening federal hate crime laws.
3. On June 3, I was honored to speak with reporters at WTVM 9 about civil rights and the right to protest. “People are concerned about all kinds of justice: economic justice, social justice, criminal justice, educational justice, election justice. People are saying, enough is enough. We need to have justice, and we need to abhor violence,” I remarked. Watch the full interview here.
Please visit my website for more information and updates. I am working hard to serve you every day.
Sincerely,
Congressman Sanford D. Bishop, Jr.

285,"Dear Alex,
I’m running for Congress to fight for bold change in Washington and to champion policies that reflect our shared values as Americans. This year, when the Trump Administration started forcibly returning asylum seekers to Mexico under the cynically named “Migrant Protection Protocols” (MPP) policy, I knew the fight was about to get harder and even more important.
Today is International Migrants Day. This week, I drove 20 minutes south from my home to Tijuana to tour a migrant shelter and see the crisis created by the MPP policy first-hand. I met with Paulina, the incredible woman who runs the shelter, Vanessa, an immigration advocate, and Beto, a refugee fleeing violence in Central America.
Beto is about my age with an infectious smile and an incredible singing voice - which he shared with us when I asked him what he did to keep his spirits up. He has been waiting for more than two years for his asylum claim to be processed, trapped in limbo.
Under MPP, thousands of asylum-seekers like Beto wind up stuck in dangerous Mexican border cities where they are vulnerable to crime and violence while they wait for their claims to be processed. A recent report from Human Rights First found over 500 cases of kidnapping, rape, torture, assault, and other violent attacks against asylum seekers and migrants returned to Mexico under MPP.
America has been a beacon of hope for generations. While we must ensure security at our southern border, the MPP policy is inhumane, cruel, and in direct contradiction to the ideals America stands for. We must hold this administration accountable.
Our tax dollars should be used to strengthen our communities by investing in education, housing, and health care programs that increase well-being, not bankroll xenophobic policies. Sign this petition to end the Migrant Protection Protocols and stand with me in showing your support for asylum seekers.
This International Migrants Day, I ask you to stand with me in speaking out for those whose voices are not heard. This crisis may be across the border, but it is in our backyard. We have a responsibility to do something about it. Please join me by signing the petition rejecting MPP.
Thank you,
Janessa

Hi Alex,
We are watching the turnout and San Mateo County could do better
I hear there are no lines at all. If you find your polling area using this link, you can finish your voting very quickly.
Visit [[URL REDACTED]] for the FAQ on voting
I would be honored to have your vote today and I promise you, I will NEVER let you down.
❤️ 🇺🇸 🙏🙏🇺🇸 ❤️
I will NEVER ever take PAC money or any Special Interest Group money. I will challenge Big Pharma and the healthcare ecosystem to make things better for every American. I will challenge the system and seek to change the culture of Washington - make things better. I will be accessible and available to you, open to your suggestions and ideas. It will be a collaborative effort of solving the tough challenges of our district. Thank you for your support.
In gratitude,
\- Rishi Kumar
\----- My closing statement as the polls close -------
On March 3rd, 2019, we launched our campaign to change the culture of Washington by going door to door in Los Altos, having conversations with neighbors about healthcare.
Since then, we’ve held town halls in every city across the district--3 meetings per month--and gained new endorsements from district residents. I have walked neighborhoods in each of the 31 cities of our district and met with neighbors to understand their specific challenges. I am proud of what Team Rishi has accomplished over the last year. We have delved into the issues of concern to our neighbors, and have laid out a new course for Silicon Valley. We have unveiled a clear vision to fix our housing, homelessness and traffic challenges, to create affordable healthcare solutions, and to expand economic opportunities for all. Visit our website, click on Articles to see the various position papers we have put together.
In just a few hours from now, voters will have decided the direction of our district and the future of our country. Our current Representative, Anna Eshoo, has failed to lead us on the critical issues our residents face on a daily basis. She has remained silent on housing and has embraced Big Pharma – taking more money from the pharmaceutical companies than any other candidate for US Congress, while supporting legislation that has increased the price tag for healthcare. I have not seen a plan or a vision from Anna to address our transportation gridlock.
The voice of voters says it all here. The voters of our district want a leader who will fight for their rights and NOT the Special Interest Groups. As a Saratoga City Councilmember, I have pushed to reduce water hikes from San Jose Water, and I fought to reduce crime throughout our city. Real impact, real results! The voters re-elected me with the most votes in city history.
As your next Representative in the U.S. Congress, I will work towards the ""21 counties, 21 minutes"" vision plan that will develop a tunnel based, high speed transportation system to make more housing accessible, address homelessness, and expand the economy. As your congressman, I will work to reduce crime in every city - roll out simple best practices that were very effective in my city. I will look at options to reduce the rising price of healthcare, and I promise you I will NOT be bought by the Pharma industry. We call our campaign of change as standing up for ""your interests, not special interests.""
I will invest in new technology to address the challenges of climate change and expand our clean-tech economy. I will make sure our public schools have the right funding, new curriculum, and technology to prepare our children for the jobs of tomorrow. And I will NEVER accept PAC money or Special Interest Group money, keeping my allegiance only with the people.
Together, we can bring real change to Congress. I will be honored to have your vote. Please vote today if you haven't already (before 8pm). How to vote? Details at [[URL REDACTED]]
NOTE: California has a new rule: U.S citizens who are NOT registered to vote can walk into any polling station by 8pm tomorrow, register to vote, then ask for a ballot and vote
I am always open to learning. I will see you soon at our next town hall meeting later this month.

289,"Hi Alex,
Strange to see that there are 5 candidates who are potentially running in the March 3rd primary election in our congressional district, but only one is taking the time to meet with our neighbors. Really? Some just like to put their name in the hat as if it is a lucky draw?
Here is another question. Do you recall when an elected congressmember of our district held 3 face to face town hall meetings a month? In the past 9 months, Rishi has met with neighbors in each of the 31 cities of our congressional district and has held 3 town hall meetings every month - one in each county. He also holds a weekly ""Rush Hour with Rishi"" video call.
America needs the right kind of leadership. Rishi has a people-centric agenda and will independently make [[URL REDACTED]] at the behest of lobbyists. Rishi has! Rishi has met with neighbors in each of the district cities of San Mateo County to get a keen sense of the issues facing every city and every neighborhood.
What differentiates Rishi from Congresswoman Anna Eshoo:
Rishi has taken the pledge to not accept any special interest, PAC, or lobbyist dollar - his allegiance is with the people, not those trying to buy our elections. Congresswoman Eshoo is the #1 career recipient of campaign contributions from Big Pharma in the U.S. House of Representatives. [[URL REDACTED]]
Will elected leaders who accept all this money be able to truly represent the people?
THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT TRUST - WHO CAN YOU TRUST?
Read this [[URL REDACTED]] quote: “Anna Eshoo’s record on drug prices is terrible, and the reason why is obvious,” David Mitchell, founder of Patients For Affordable Drugs. “She’s taken enormous sums of money from drug corporations, and she does their bidding in Washington.”
""[[URL REDACTED]] Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Cal.) — the chair of the Energy and Commerce panel’s health subcommittee — have each continued to accept contributions from PACs affiliated with companies including Pfizer, Amgen, and Novartis throughout 2019""
""Patients for Affordable Drugs Now last year even sank $500,000 into ads attacking Eshoo for receiving drug industry money. ""
""Democratic lawmakers’ continued willingness to accept pharmaceutical industry campaign contributions also comes despite a climate in which voters have come to dislike the pharmaceutical industry more than any other, according to a recent Gallup poll.""
ENDS QUOTE
RISHI HAS A PEOPLE-CENTRIC AGENDA
To get a view on how Rishi put the people of our district first, please watch the video below
Too often our politicians recite planned talking points and rehearsed speeches, without giving any real substance to their plans to better the quality of life of those they are seeking to serve. That’s why Rishi has been running a different kind of campaign — one that puts the residents of our district first and the critical issues our families face on a daily basis. Rishi is committed to listening.
RISHI'S ACTIVISM: As a Saratoga City Councilmember, Rishi took on an investor owned water utility company and helped reject, reduce and suspend seven of their rate increase proposals that would have adversely impacted a million residents of Silicon Valley. Here is a video of Rishi's speech at a CPUC public hearing (11/17).
RISHI DROPPED BURGLARIES: Rishi also focused upon neighborhood crime which has become a significant source of concern in every Silicon Valley city. Click on this link to download a safety tips sheet specifically geared for your city. As Saratoga's councilmember, Rishi stemmed the tide on increasing burglaries. Watch this video to learn how Saratoga crime dropped by almost 50%
RISHI SEEKS TO EARN YOUR TRUST
We hope we can earn your trust and your vote for the March 3rd primary election.
Choose the candidate that will truly represent the people.
Please do not hesitate to call or set up a time to talk about the race and the issues impacting you!

290,"We invested our scarce campaign resources to help our neighbors with pandemic. With the spike, we continue...
Hi Alex,
I’ve never believed in sitting on my hands. That’s for the career politicians, who have been too comfortable with the old way of doing business for decades.
These past few months, I’ve been telling my team what I’ve believed my entire life: when we’re in crisis, we help! That’s why back in March, our team stopped our campaign and launched the Neighborhood Pandemic Preparedness Team (NPPT) to help the most vulnerable in our community. We invested our scarce campaign resources to help our neighbors. And the results speak for themselves:
* We dropped thousands of flyers outside the homes of our neighbors expressing our desire to help.
* We called all 86,000 seniors in the district, delivering groceries, medications, and even their favorite coffee! We helped them stay sheltered-in-place.
* Organized over 23 town halls with local health experts, stimulus package experts, small business experts, college admissions counselors, and community activists
* Sewed a few thousand masks, all of which were donated to the Valley Medical Foundation; including PPEs that were donated to us that included N-95 masks
* Created a comprehensive list of resources for those struggling in the COVID-19 economy, from career advice for the unemployed to loan application information for small businesses. Visit [[URL REDACTED]] NOTE: You can join our NPPT team and help neighbors by submitting your info at this page - just scroll down all the way to the bottom.
* Offered shelter-in-place coding classes (currently in session) — sign-up at [[URL REDACTED]]
And as the Silicon Valley faces a new spike in COVID-19 cases, I’m writing this message to let you know that my team of hundreds of volunteers stands ready to help in whatever ways we can. Whether you need someone to pick up your groceries and prescriptions, or are looking for resources to help you navigate these difficult times, my experienced team is eager to continue their quest of helping folks in our community. To that end, my campaign is taking the next few weeks to leave flyers outside people’s homes letting them know we're here to help. Rest assured all of our volunteers are well-trained in complying with CDC guidelines, with masks, social distancing and the whole enchilada. We have all stayed safe for months while helping thousands of Silicon Valley neighbors; yes, we understand the challenges of the Covid-19 world.
I’ll end with this thought: Please don't hesitate to reach out to us, no matter who you support this November. Because just like I learned when I launched many neighborhood watch programs that nearly halved Saratoga’s crime five years ago, neighbors always help neighbors. We can move mountains together…like not allowing 7 San Jose Water rate proposals to move forward.
I will always be with you.
My commitment to serve all people is steadfast - Republicans and Democrats, every possible demographic and every strata of our society.
I will specifically focus on folks who don’t have a voice. For sure! No questions asked!

Warm Regards,
🇺🇸 Rishi Kumar 🇺🇸

Hi Alex,
Please join this discussion about racism, inequality and crime.
Today @ 4pm
RSVP at [[URL REDACTED]]
""You can't walk while black. You can't jog while black. You can’t drive while black. And... you can’t sleep while you are black”
America has had enough. It is time we all stood together and said, “No more.”
How can we have an America that believes in justice for all when we have such blatant prejudice?
No more precious American lives tragically murdered and lost every year.
No more children separated from their fathers ….forever.
It is time we changed [[URL REDACTED]] and forever
Let us find answers together.
Please join me today for an important discussion on how each and every one of us can make a real difference in changing the systemic racism that has fomented in our society since the first slaves were brought here four hundred years ago.
Ahmaud Arbery was gunned down while on a jog in Georgia. Breonna Taylor was shot by Louisville police while asleep in her own bed. Tony McDade was asked to not move, he didn’t move, and he was still shot. And we all know what happened to George Floyd.
Racial injustice, the systemic issues and disparities that exist in our society that also cause inequality must be addressed now and with a real sense of urgency. What is happening around us is not just civil unrest but an expression of grief and anger over the needless deaths over hundreds of years. The violence has to stop but we have to express our grief and find answers out of this mess America is in.
Our elected leaders have failed us for decades now, in their inability to put an end to this. We need to be leading the charge and demanding massive institutional reforms of police departments.
If we don’t do something now, none of us will escape prejudice and our communities will continue to pay the price and bear the consequences. We have to purge this plague of violence from the world. Police brutality of American citizens is unacceptable and must not be tolerated by politicians who, year after year, turn a blind eye.
The time to unlearn hatred is now and the cultural shift from prejudice to love. This is overdue and we should stop breathing till we do that.
The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “A riot is the language of the unheard.” Violence must never be condoned, but leaders must listen to the voices of the people.
We need new leadership, and we need to take action NOW.
Here is a compilation of anti-racism resources and organizations you can donate.
Please review and act.
“No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.”
\- Nelson Mandela

293,"Out of touch elected leaders are in vogue. But Rishi has been fighting San Jose Water Company for years - a private investor owned utility company
Hi Alex,
How do you display your support for an upstart challenger? How about a red, white and blue lawn sign? I got a simple question from someone based on our lawn signs that are slowly appearing all over the Congressional District. ""Should I contribute to your campaign to get the lawn sign?"" Oh no, not at all. Just make your request at [[URL REDACTED]] and we will drop it [[URL REDACTED]] soon as this weekend.
Out of touch elected leaders are in vogue: Rep. Anna Eshoo recently delivered a speech on August 26, 2020. Elected leaders being out of touch is a myth or a reality? You need to watch the excerpted 2 minute speech. From Rep. Eshoo's speech, “’…there were orange jumpsuits. And those were the individuals from the California Department of Corrections. They too have been trained in firefighting. they work the fires. …I didn’t know that…” Tell me, who does not know that?
Rep. Eshoo is blissfully ignorant that having inmates on the fire lines is a paramount social justice issue and changes need to be made. As per Rep. Eshoo, “I salute them for doing their fair share.” For Rep. Eshoo to not be aware of the issue, never mind their involvement, is inexcusable. For the complete writeup, click on this blog link.
As we enter the final push to win this race, I need your support:

295,"Rep. Eshoo is in her 28th year, but has only passed 4 bills into law. Two bills renamed a post office and federal building. Another redesignated a month as National Scleroderma Awareness Month and the 4th modified provisions to determine payments at children’s hospital. Ineffective legislations.
Hi Alex,
Rep. Eshoo only has 4 trivial bills in 28 years ?
I did not believe it when it was brought to my attention. I called a Washington Congressional Representative. This is what I was told, “No way Rep. Eshoo has 49 Bills. Clear standard in Congress is bills in your name. Cosponsorship does not matter.” [[URL REDACTED]] is the single source of truth. Do not trust anything else. Click on the link above – see for yourself.
But let us talk about my track record: Why did someone like me win with the most votes in Saratoga’s election history - beating the Mayor quite easily on Election night 2018. Let me say this, I barely scraped through with 71 votes in 2014 during my first run to the Saratoga City Council. For the re-election, I was endorsed by hundreds including congressional representatives, senators, assembly members, county supervisors, mayors, vice mayors, councilmembers and hundreds of neighborhood leaders. But the establishment of Saratoga always felt undermined and chose not to endorse my run. I am grassroots-driven and people-powered - the reason we won: I took on the toughest challenges that no one on my city council wanted to. That is what activists do. The 2018 win was historical! It told me clearly that if you do the right thing for the people, you won’t need to worry about the kitchen sink thrown at you. I challenged the system and some of my city council colleagues were not happy. Just read the Mountain Winery project from earlier this year.
As a Silicon Valley elected leader, with my tech roots defining my “getting things done” approach, I have aspired to operate at a high level of excellence as an elected leader. I treated my elected leadership role very seriously. Thousands of people had trusted me with their vote, and I couldn’t let them down. Silicon Valley has never been about activity for the sake of activity, but about results - in every domain. That is my DNA.
Why am I in politics? To solve problems! I will always fight on behalf of the people and seek to establish trust directly with the people.
But politicians today are gaming the system – sometimes for 28 years.
Three parts to this 28-yearlong saga:
Part 1: Asleep on the Wheel
28 years and 4 pieces of legislation that became law: a colossal failure. Two of Rep. Eshoo’s bills renamed a post office and federal building. Another designated a month as National Scleroderma Awareness Month. The fourth modified provisions to determine payments at children’s hospitals.
Well, you need a majority to pass a law: There were at least two occasions where the Democrats had a majority in the House and Senate with a sitting Democratic President. Rep. Eshoo could have passed any law she wanted. Simply put, Rep. Eshoo could have done a lot more. She made 100 attempts at legislations in her first 27 years (without the threat of a competitive run). Whereas Rep. Ro Khanna has already made 50 attempts at legislations in his first 4 years. No matter how you look at it, Rep. Eshoo is a failure. Rep. Eshoo is being deceptive when she claims 49 bills with no hyperlinks to back that claim. Remember, links have to go to [[URL REDACTED]]
Cosponsorship of bills should have some value: Rep. Eshoo’s record is mediocre no matter how you slice and dice it. Rishi called it out: most of Rep. Eshoo’s work is a “tag along” and co-sponsorship. No, she has not exactly been the chief innovator by introducing bills that passed and became law. For example - Rep. Eshoo claimed cosponsorship of the Green New Deal at the debate. Senator Markey is the original sponsor and gets the majority of the credit. I pointed out that there were 101 cosponsors of the Green New Deal. Notably, Senator Markey has introduced game changing legislations - since his days in the House.
But this is exactly what Silicon Valley residents have been talking about – lack of accomplishments. Her weekly updates or candidate statements have been about, “I voted for this, I sent this letter, I plan to do this” but the accomplishments and results have been missing for 28 years.
Failures galore: Failure with the Pandemic, with California Fires, with Traffic, with Housing, with Homelessness, with Big Tech. For example, under Rep. Eshoo’s watch, Facebook - located in our congressional district - was investigated for misusing user data. Later at the congressional hearing, you can watch Rep. Eshoo proudly ask the questions reading from sheets of paper written by an aide. But it was her failure to legislate that led to this. Blindsided for sure. Out of touch?
Part Deux: Harming the American people
But the story of her failures gets sordid. Not addressing the people challenges, but actually harming the people’s interests.
#1 Rep. Eshoo worked 15 years on a pandemic plan, but failed to codify it. As the chair of the House Health Subcommittee - the onus was upon her for sure. As the co-chair of the Biodefense Caucus, Rep. Eshoo did not hold a single meeting, even though putting a pandemic plan was part of the mission. I highly recommend you click on this link and read her endorsements – sitting upon a shaky foundation. Just a bad political nexus – why should failures be appreciated? You will find the Citizens United endorsement appalling.
#2 IN 2009, she introduced legislation that favors Pharma \- as the chair of the House Health Subcommittee - did not favor people, giving pharmaceutical companies 12-year exclusivity periods for biologic drugs, beyond the length of their patents, to protect them from competition by the generic drug industry. For this, she received multiple awards from the industry. Don’t forget, she is the #1 recipient of Pharma money in the United States House of Representatives. After the Stanford Daily shared their concern for Rep. Eshoo’s ties to Big Pharma, Rep. Eshoo herself ADMITTED and justified it. We don’t buy the justification. Rep. Eshoo did nothing against Big Pharma greed; 700,000 opioid deaths over the last 20 years.
#3 California Fires: Watch the video of Rep. Eshoo at a CalFire hearing. She confessed that she had no idea California uses inmates for fire-fighting. Here are a few people quotes who were watching:
I was appalled at her ""visit"" during this terrible time. She offered nothing but a campaign speech.
\- Robin Woodman
Ha! Pretty brilliant campaigning to pull this one out. I remember this press conference. We were wondering if our neighborhood was on fire yet and she didn't really know what to say other than lots of self-referencing. I already put my ballot in and voted for you.
\- Julie Kanagy
She is terrible. I'm surviving the CZU fire, and she's just using as a tool.
\- Liz Wolfe
This was super tone def. I remember being super pissed when she started speaking ‘cause I just wanted to know if my home was going to survive
\- Kirsten Tuck
It was obvious she has never been in this neck of her district and had no idea about the inmate fire fighters or any other information. She needed to be short and sweet and let the experts talk. Please be better than this Rishi... come hike in the redwoods and get to know those of us in the woods.
\- Renee Waggener
I don’t even think she knows where she is...
\- Nicolo Pastor
Anna Eshoo who. As you can tell She’s never cared or been a part of our community. She doesn’t have my vote. We need to clean house around here.
\- Nick Thompson
Part 3: Viewpoints from the people: More here
“I was done with Eshoo when she joined with ultra right wing Joe Barton of TX to block the quicker path towards drugs becoming generic. When was that? About ten years ago. I’ll be glad to vote for Rishi Kumar”
\- John Fox
I voted for you last week by absentee ballot, and my family the same. People aren't stupid, they can be fooled some of the time, and
your time has come. Wishing you victory, as it will be a victory for the People in this district. We cannot tolerate incompetence and
corruption any more. Not at the district level, the State, or the Country. Americans are fed up with sick, corrupt, incompetent crime
family syndicates that are robbing our wealth and future. We nearing a major sea change by the 'silent majority'. No one can stop us.
\- Danny
I would be honored to have your vote
My run seeks to bring ethical integrity into politics by NEVER accepting PAC money or Special Interest Group money. I bring a result-driven outcome to challenge the Washington status quo and divisive partisan politics.
America is ready for a new leadership.
It is time for change. I will serve with integrity, honor and energy. And I will be there for every resident of our district. That is a promise.
Question to ponder: What is the outcome of mediocrity in Silicon Valley?
The choice is ours.
Rep. Eshoo has not been a strong enough voice, and is even out of touch, on the important issues of today, and it’s time for change.
I would be honored to have your vote.
In solidarity,
Rishi Kumar

Carpenters Union Thugs Are Attacking Our Signs
Hello Alex,
The most unbelievable thing happened the other day. A union, specifically the Southwest Carpenter’s Union, destroyed multiple of my large, very costly, campaign signs, and then stuck signs up that said this:
Sadly, while I said this is unbelievable, it really isn’t. Unions control politicians like Susie Lee, so they need to try to make sure she gets elected. This is because they know they will not be able to control me!
There is a police investigation into this criminal activity by Susie Lee’s thugs, activity that my team caught them on camera admitting. I intend to prosecute.
(Below is the 7 minute video of the Southwest Carpenters Union members admitting to the crime and trying to intimidate my staff)
Carpenters Union Admits to Vandalism and Harasses Rodimer Staff
In the meantime, I ask that you help me get my signs back up, and quickly. There are still people who haven’t voted and I need to make sure I reach those people so that we can turn this state RED. Can you contribute $25 right now to help make sure Susie Lee’s thugs don’t get away with what they did? That way we can fire Susie Lee and finally bring ethics back to our great state, when I am elected.

297,"Susie Lee has been lying about our family.
You Deserve The Truth
Hello Alex,
When Dan decided to run for political office, it was a decision we made together, as a family. We have five children, with a sixth on the way. Together, we certainly knew that politics can and would get ugly. But, nothing could prepare our family for the outright lies and disgusting attacks that have been launched against us by Susie Lee.
My husband was arrested one time in his life, years ago while he was in college on a Halloween night, after shoving another adult male who had been bullying one of Dan’s friends. That’s it. One arrest. And the charges from that one arrest were dismissed. In fact, to this very day, Dan Rodimer has no criminal record.
As for Susie Lee using 911 calls, the government documents Susie refers to in her smears clearly state nothing more than a verbal argument occurred and no crime was committed. Yet she continues to smear us with lies, knowing full well they aren’t true. Susie Lee thinks it’s okay to spend millions of dollars exploiting my family for her political gain. It’s shameful and it disgusts me.
In fact, the largest coalition of Nevada law enforcement have endorsed my husband in this race. Its the largest in the state. Not only that, they stripped Susie of this endorsement and gave it to Dan. … something they wouldn’t do if they believed he was at all dangerous or had any kind of criminal record.
Susie Lee has done nothing for the people she represents. She has failed the people of Nevada in CD3. Instead, she’s used her taxpayer-funded position to enrich herself and her family while in office. She’s spending millions of dollars smearing Dan instead of running ads about her own record, because her record is terrible.
Dan Rodimer is a wonderful man. To his friends, or anyone that meets him, he’s truly one of the kindest. He’s a loving and compassionate husband. And, he is a great Dad and role model to our children.
As the mother of our kids, and as Dan’s wife, we will fight through it.
Yes, “Big Dan” is a former WWE professional wrestler, but he isn’t the only one who is tough in our family. We will continue to love one another, and we will leave our trust in you the voters, to see through these disgusting lies against our husband, dad and friend.
Thank you for taking a few moments of your day to read this.

Alex,
The United States is home to 5% of the world’s population, but 25% of the world’s prisoners.
It’s no question that our criminal justice system is broken. We have to do much better.
1 in 17 white men will go to prison during their lifetime, and because of institutionalized racism, an indefensible 1 in 3 black men will serve time. People of color, on average, face longer prison sentences than their white, non-Hispanic counterparts for similar crimes committed. Voting restrictions—both during and after incarceration— have silenced millions of voices. Once released from prison, the formerly incarcerated often face difficulty re-entering the workforce which inhibits their ability to contribute meaningfully to society and to simply provide for themselves and their families.
We must fix this corrupt system that criminalizes poverty.
I proudly support ending arrest quotas and cash bail. I will do everything in my power to end for-profit prisons and mass incarceration, which have historically impacted people of color at a much higher rate. Prisoners are not opportunities for more profit.
I believe in being a voice for everyone. Starting a $3 recurring donation pays for enough literature to contact 15 underserved members of our district. Will you send me to Congress so I can fight for every member of NY-12?

Alex,
Today I delivered remarks on the Senate floor and I wanted to share with you a couple of very important facts regarding the Democrats partisan impeachment of President Trump.
1. The Democrats have been working toward last night’s impeachment of President Trump since the night he was elected in 2016. The House's vote yesterday was not some neutral judgment that Democrats came to reluctantly. It was the predetermined end of a partisan crusade that began before President Trump was even sworn in.
2. Last night, after months of secret hearings, private basement meetings and denying President Trump due process, the House Democrats concluded the most rushed, least thorough, and most unfair impeachment inquiry in modern history.
3. The House Democrats impeached a president whom they do not even allege has committed an actual crime known to our laws. They impeached simply because they disagree with a presidential act and question the motive behind it.
4. While those who voted FOR impeachment were totally partisan, opposition to the impeachment was bi-partisan.
5. Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats are so concerned about their shoddy work, they are now suggesting they may not deliver their partisan articles of impeachment to the Senate for a fair trial.
6. The Senate is committed to a fair and just trial based on facts and due process.
I think it is completely outrageous that now Nancy Pelosi is threatening to stall impeachment from going to the Senate. My message to Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats is that they had their turn, they failed, and now it is the Senate’s turn to fulfill our duty as the stabilizing, institution-preserving, fever-breaking role for which the United States Senate was created!
While the House Democrats ran a completely partisan and unfair process, the Senate is committed to a fair trial. Will you stand with me?
The Democrats have shown the extremely low levels they will stoop to when they are in charge. Our Senate Majority is the only thing stopping the Democrats.
I need your support to help us defend the majority. Will you please chip in whatever you can now?
Thanks,
Mitch McConnell

Alex,
Despite nasty attacks from the far left Democrats, I will always protect American families from the crimes, drugs, and illegal aliens that flood across our southern border.
I’m fulfilling my promise to BUILD THE WALL because American families deserve to be protected. However -- if they're elected, the Washington Democrats would harm American families by locking down our economy and opening up our borders. Tiffany Shedd will join me in building the wall, reopening our economy, and fighting for YOU.
Will you join me in fighting to send Tiffany to Washington? She’s under attack by the far left, and she’s become a top target of liberal groups, who will fight tooth and nail to keep her out of Washington. Tiffany needs your URGENT support RIGHT NOW!

**Breaking News: The Senate Acquits President Trump***
Alex,
It happened. After the Democrats wasted months of our time and taxpayer dollars investigating President Trump, we found out that President Trump did not commit ANY crimes.
This entire stunt was just a political scheme started by Nancy Pelosi and her liberal supporters, like Tom O'Halleran, who tried to overturn the 2016, election by impeachment.
Alex, now that Trump has been cleared, he needs real support in Congress. That’s why we’re launching a 24-Hour Impeachment Defeated Fund.
Help us celebrate this HISTORIC victory by making sure Trump gets the support he needs!
Rush in $25 and help us send Tiffany to Congress to fight for President Trump’s winning agenda>>>
Hurry this fund ends in 24 hours!
Rush in 20.20 >>>
Rush in $50 >>>
Rush in $100 >>>
Rush in $250 >>>
Tiffany will ""never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the"" people in Arizona.
Help her get there >>>>
Thank you,

Alex,
The Democrats in Congress are out of control. One-fifth of the House Democratic caucus has co-sponsored a new bill called The New Way Forward. This bill transforms our immigration system to ensure that criminals are allowed to move to the United States and become citizens.
The New Way Forward bill would:
* Make it nearly impossible for ICE to detain immigrants
* Make it illegal to automatically deport criminals regardless of crime
* Allow people who commit serious felonies in other countries to still come to the United States
* Decriminalize illegal entry into the US.
This bill abolishes our borders and allows anyone to freely enter our country without any consequences.
If enacted The New Way Forward bill would be disastrous.
Alex, Tiffany grew up, raised her family, and owns a farm near the southern border so she understands the real issues that affect our border. She supports building the wall and increasing our border security measures.
If enacted The New Way Forward bill would be disastrous. It prioritizes criminals ahead of the safety and security of American families.
Stand with Tiffany against this new threat to our national security by signing our Stop The New Way Forward Petition.
Add your name to stand with Tiffany and say no to opening our borders>>>
One thing is clear – this bill makes it easier to arrest you, as an American citizen than arresting an illegal immigrant.
Stand with Tiffany ➝ fight back
It’s alarming how so many Democrats want to reshape our immigration system and put our communities at risk. We need Tiffany in Congress to stand against this and to fight with President Trump.
Thank you,
Team Shedd

Dear Patriot
It's Aliscia Andrews here, and as you know, I'm a U. S. Marine, National security expert who has worked keeping our nation safe at the border, and a mom who has seen the Left destroy this country one piece at a time.
This is a district that has been Republican for 60 out of the last 66 years and can be flipped with your support!
I’m done letting it happen. I’m fighting back with everything I have.
I’ve spent a career keeping this nation safe. Now, the Left is trying to undo all of our security by abolishing the police, abolishing law and order, and keeping our economy shackled in lockdown.
Can I count on you to join our stand against Socialism? Donate $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, or any other amount today and you can help us stop the Socialist Left from taking over!
DONATE TODAY!
There are only 28 Days left!
We have a choice—we can either choose President Trump, the side that’s beating the coronavirus or the Socialist Radical Left that wants to topple all public safety in the middle of a crime wave and a pandemic.
I’m standing with our President!
He beat the coronavirus and just left the hospital! But, not before thanking the tens of thousands of Trump supporters for coming to pray for him!
The Left lost their minds when he did this. They beat their keyboards screaming about how he isn’t really sick, endangered people, and other nonsense accusations!
If President Obama had done the exact same thing after getting sick, they would be fawning over him for his bravery.
The Fake News media is blinded by fanatical leftist hatred against our President. No President has been more mistreated by the Fake News media!
Let’s send them a strong message— let’s retire Socialist Wexton who wrongly tweeted that our President is a white supremacist!
That’s just sick!
Please donate your most generous gift today and we can stop the Socialist Left here and now! We only have 28 days and we need to keep up with Bloomberg’s spending here in the 10th!
God Bless,

Dear Patriot,
It’s Aliscia Andrews. As you know, I am running to retake Virginia’s 10th District from Socialist Jennifer Wexton and her billionaire swamp backers, like Mike Bloomberg!
I’m a US Marine, a Specialist in National Security working to secure our border, an unapologetic conservative, a strong supporter of President Trump, and 100% pro-life!
The Socialist Left have lost its mind.
Radical BLM extremists and Antifa terrorists are driving us towards abolishing every police department in America!
Socialist Jennifer Wexton is standing with their radical, anti-police agenda! So far, she has REFUSED to condemn the horrible violence against our cops!
As they chant “abolish the police,” the Leftist mob has attacked police left and right around the nation!
Socialist Jennifer Wexton is an absolute embarrassment!
Will you help me get rid of her?
Please donate today and help me fight back against Socialist Wexton and the Leftist mob’s effort to Defund/Abolish the police!
*FIGHT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT!*
In Prince William County, near where I live, a Defund/Abolish the Police protest was held outside the county building!
I was at an event there when these protestors showed up and began blocking the county government building entrance, screaming obscenities and antagonizing the police officers just doing their jobs!
After a counter protestor tried to enter the building, the crowd of BLM radicals surrounded and attacked the man!
Police arrested four radicals who assaulted the man as he tried to enter the building. All four were charged with assault and battery.
This is just sick! I had the misfortune of watching these radicals plot their attack and descend on this counter protestor for the crime of walking into a government building!
These radical BLM extremists are trying to destroy this country—one riot at a time!
How many more innocent Americans need to be attacked by the Leftist mob before Socialist Wexton even bats an eye?
She doesn’t care about us. And it’s time for a change in leadership!
It’s time for a #WEXIT!
Will you help me fight back?
Please donate $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, $1,000, or more to my campaign and send a strong conservative to Washington who will stand up against the Leftist mob!
Thank you for your support and prayers!

Dear Patriot,
My name is Aliscia Andrews. I’m a conservative, a Trump supporter, a US Marine, and now serve in Homeland Security keeping our country safe from threats both foreign and domestic. I am running to take back Virginia’s 10th District from Socialist Jennifer Wexton!
Virginia is under attack as Leftist socialists are assaulting our freedoms at every turn… And Jennifer Wexton is on the front lines leading the charge!
She voted for the impeachment charade, has been at Pelosi’s every beck and call, and has backed Socialist bills like Medicare for All!
Simply put, we have to stop her! Please donate today to my campaign and together, we can take back the 10th!
I know what it's like to serve and give the ultimate sacrifice. One of my closest friends in high school died serving this country. He sacrificed everything. And it inspired me to put it all on the line as well.
I joined the US Marines. As a Marine, I have been deployed to the Middle East, Africa, and everything in between. I have seen the suffering that tyranny and socialist policies bring.
And it’s exactly why I got off the sidelines and decided to run for Congress. The Swamp and Washington insider politicians have had their way long enough!
At every turn, they fight our President. The Deep State and their allies in Congress have plotted to take down the President since Day one.
This impeachment charade was pathetic. I was appalled and embarrassed for my district when I watched Wexton help lead the charge to impeach the President on bogus charges!
We need someone that will stand with the President and stand with his agenda! The President needs fighters in Washington!
We need real leadership in Washington! Please donate $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, or more to my campaign today!
As a homeland security official, I understand the threats facing our nation. I fight them every day I go to the office. The border is one of the greatest threats facing this nation.
Our Southern border is being invaded by illegal aliens skipping the line. Many take advantage of our porous borders and bring drugs, crime, and even terrorism into our nation.
Simply put, we MUST build the wall! I would stand with our President and fight against illegal immigration and secure our southern border!

Dear Patriot,
My name is Aliscia Andrews, the Republican nominee for Virginia’s 10th district—one of the biggest opportunities to flip a seat back to red this election year.
We have 42 Days Left!
The very future of our country could be decided in less than 50 days! It’s now or never!
We have watched a snapshot of what Biden’s America looks like for the last four months—
* Democrat-enforced lockdowns on business, churches, and funerals—but abortion clinics and riots are totally safe
* Absolute anarchy and chaos in every major city for the last four months—with more than TWO BILLION in property damage, thousands wounded, and dozens killed by Leftist mobs!
* Sky-high crime rates in every city but Democrats ramming through defund/abolish the police!
* Mobs attacking Republicans left and right—including one Trump supporter shot to death in Portland
* Democrats blocking coronavirus relief and turning around and blaming Republicans!
* Police officers being hunted down as the Left convince America they are all racist murderers…
This should terrify you.
And unless we take back Congress AND the White House, that’s our future.
Socialist Wexton is a vile Socialist voting with the squad 94% of the time—she’s another Leftist stooge siding with attacks against our police!
That is why I am fighting back! But I can’t do it alone…
We have a massive fundraising deadline fast approaching and the swamp and Socialist billionaire Bloomberg are pouring in MILLIONS to buy this district!
Can you chip in $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, $1,000, or more to STOP this Socialist anarchy in our streets and take back our Congress?

President Trump needs the help of good conservative leadership to fight back!

Because they know they can’t beat him at the ballot box, they made up the impeachment charges and held a kangaroo court!

* Lessen criminal penalties for violent crimes like rape, murder, and domestic assault
* Encourage violently attacking police by lessening assault of an officer to a misdemeanor
* Allow cops to be easily fired for doing their jobs

Dear Patriot,
Our Country is at a crossroads right now…
As the Coronavirus spreads from country to country and has even spread in pockets to our shores, we are reminded of how vitally important our borders are… and how insecure they are currently.
Our nation is being invaded by illegal aliens, pouring across our unsecure Southern border. Thousands of drug smugglers and human traffickers hide amongst them, bringing in violent crime.
In the wake of a pandemic, we need action NOW!
Please donate to my campaign and send a true conservative to Washington who will stand with the President and Build the Wall!
As a Homeland Security Policy Strategist, my job is to help keep our country safe. Every day, I have to deal with the consequences of an unsecure border, from a coronavirus outbreak to a gang shooting in our neighborhoods.
Waves of people pouring across our border in caravans, unvetted and illegally, is a huge national security risk! And Democrats like Jennifer Wexton will not do anything. In fact, they WANT open borders. Socialists like George Soros are even funding some of the caravans.
Why? Because they hope one day to grant illegal aliens total amnesty and create a new wave of democrat voters. And they don’t care how many Americans get hurt in the process.
These open-borders, pro-illegal Democrats like Wexton even go as far as to attack our existing border security infrastructure. Democrats have even said they want to abolish ICE! I need your help to stop them!
Its time to stand with the President, Build the Wall, and secure our Southern Border once and for all!
Please donate $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, or more to my campaign today and help me fight with the President!
The Illegal-First agenda needs to be stopped now! Our Country is so vulnerable to global pandemics like Coronavirus and smuggling without a secure border.
The Wall is just the start…
If elected, I will get border security and ICE the tools it needs to verify very single person who tries to step foot on American soil.
Socialist, illegal-first Democrats like Jennifer Wexton need to be sent packing and replaced by Conservatives who will stand with our President!

This kind of sick propaganda is being run by the DNC/the Fake News media to stop President Trump from winning!
Leftist hatred is on full display…
That’s why it’s so important we beat the Socialist Left at every level this election! We cannot let them have one bit of power! If they do, they’ll tear this country apart!
We have 21 Days left to stop them!
This kind of extremism needs to be stopped! We CANNOT let the Left have control of Congress again! If they do, they’ll impeach the President again and run more witch hunts against him!
Can you help me stop Socialist Wexton with a donation of $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, or any other amount today?
We can do this—but we need YOUR help! Please chip in and together, we will win!

This month, legislators in Topeka took up an important proposal that would allow victims of childhood sex crimes more time to confront their perpetrators. And Usha’s testimony at the hearing on February 11 made the case: “I was 53 years old when I found my voice. I didn’t have the emotional energy until then.”
Simply put, children who survive sexual abuse ought to have the ability to seek justice when they’re ready, not according to a dictated deadline. Usha’s story shows that as a Senator she will spearhead the national struggle to defeat precedent that prevents victims from receiving the justice they deserve.
On Monday, Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of rape after years of stalling and harassing his victims, and Usha tweeted: “We’ve moved the needle. It’s time to stop victim-blaming and start listening to survivors.”
If you’re a survivor, Usha is fighting for your chance to join her in saying,
“I’ve found my voice.""

Tonight, August 14:
Team Bernie and Dream Defenders will be hosting a livestream and panel discussion on the Black Lives Matter movement, the impact of prosecutor and attorneys races, and important next steps for our movement and for transforming the criminal justice system in Florida and beyond.
We hope you'll join us and tune in at 7:00 p.m. ET >>
Friends -
Florida's statewide primary is this Tuesday, August 18, and Bernie has endorsed Joe Kimok and Monique Worrell in two very important state's attorneys races.
Now more than ever, it is critical that we show the strength of our multi-generational, multi-racial working class movement by electing strong progressives — and that we all stay safe while doing so.
Polling places will be open across the state on Tuesday, August 18 from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., and absentee voting is strongly encouraged. If you are voting by mail, your ballot must be received by your county's elections office by 7:00 pm on Tuesday, August 18.
Check the Florida Department of State's website to find your nearest polling place, and to find more info about voting in Tuesday's primary election.
LEARN MORE
Be sure to cast your ballot, and if you can, vote for these Bernie-endorsed candidates fighting for justice and a progressive agenda here in Florida.
Joe Kimok is running for Broward County State Attorney to dismantle a criminal justice system that criminalizes poverty, perpetuates institutionalized racism, and continues a failed war on drugs that has devastated communities of color. He will work to end cash bail, the war on drugs and the school-to-prison pipeline, and is someone who understands that his job is to fight for justice, not simply put people in jail.
Monique Worrell is running for Orange-Osceola State Attorney, and is particularly focused on criminal justice reform. She has taught and advocated a wide range of progressive criminal justice ideas throughout her career, and most recently served as the Chief Legal Officer of the Reform Alliance. She will work to ensure police accountability, end cash bail, and work to address the root causes of crime in our society by treating incarceration as a last resort.
From the very beginning, Bernie always said that our campaign for president was never about winning a single election — it was about building a movement.
That's what these candidates are fighting for too, because they know that real change never happens from the top on down — it happens from the bottom on up.
Not me. Us.
Let's send Joe Kimok and Monique Worrell to the state's attorneys office in Broward and Orange-Osceola Counties, so they can continue the fight for justice and represent our movement.
Use this link for info on returning your ballot and voting in Tuesday's primary.
In solidarity,

As you read this, tens of thousands of people are marching coast to coast for racial justice and to express their disgust at the torture and murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. And what people realize, more than ever before, is that we need real criminal justice and police department reform in this country. And that means that we need district attorneys and prosecutors who understand that their job is not throwing people in jail but that their job is fighting for justice.
So while we are all paying attention to the presidential campaign and congressional campaigns, in this moment — especially in this moment — we must fight against a criminal justice system that criminalizes poverty, perpetuates institutionalized racism, and continues a failed war on drugs that has devastated communities of color.
Now, no one person can change that system alone. But the public officials who are on the front lines of that struggle, and who on a day-to-day basis have a huge impact on criminal justice and police department reform, are district attorneys, state’s attorneys and prosecutors. And what happens in these offices across the country is critically important and will impact millions of lives.
So today, I am endorsing 10 great, progressive candidates for district attorney, state’s attorney and prosecutor, and they can use your help:
Can you split a $11 donation between 10 great progressive candidates running for district attorney, state’s attorney, prosecutor, and to our work to win progressive change? Your donation will go a VERY long way in these races, so please add it today.
We’ve had some success electing progressives in Philadelphia, San Francisco and other places. But we have a lot more to do.
Here are the 10 candidates I am asking you to help:
Victoria Burton-Harris is challenging an incumbent prosecutor who has received repeated criticism for a failure to fully investigate crimes in the county, overseeing a backlog of over 10,000 unprocessed rape kits and more cases of wrongful convictions in Wayne County than the rest of Michigan combined.
Jacquie Esser is the first Deputy Public Defender to run for Honolulu Prosecutor. For the last decade, Jacquie has represented over 1,000 clients and worked to reform the criminal justice system as a Deputy Public Defender, demanding fair treatment and justice for Honolulu citizens of all backgrounds. As Honolulu Prosecutor, Jacquie would create a Prosecutor's Office that encourages rehabilitation, stabilization, and reintegration in the community whenever possible.
Kim Gardner is the current St. Louis City Attorney where she reduced the average daily jail population by 39 percent without increasing the crime rate in St. Louis. Kim has increased police accountability by prosecuting officers who break the law and refusing to rely on the testimony of officers accused of misconduct. She was among the first prosecutors nationwide to publish the department’s ""exclusion list"" of untrustworthy police officers whose cases would not be brought without strong evidence untainted by their involvement.
José Garza is a former state and federal public defender, immigrant rights activist, attorney, and is currently the Co-Executive Director of Workers Defense Project in Austin, Texas. He is a long time community leader within the criminal justice, immigrant justice and civil justice community in Central Texas.
George Gascón is running in a race the LA Times called the most important contest in the country outside of the presidency. Los Angeles is home to the largest criminal justice jurisdiction and jail in the nation. George is facing a two-term ""tough on crime"" incumbent who has been criticized by Black Lives Matter and the ACLU for failing to hold officers accountable for excessive use of force.
Amy Padden is a true progressive, running on a Criminal Justice reform platform, including combating mass incarceration, prosecuting hate crimes and police misconduct, and protecting immigrant communities. She has received the backing of Democrats and progressives across Colorado, as well as national criminal justice reformers.
Alonzo Payne is a criminal justice reformer, advocating for measures to reduce incarceration and stop the criminalization of poverty in Southern Colorado. He has advocated for economic justice measures, including raising the minimum wage and Medicare for All, and is committed to representing the proud people of San Luis Valley.
Eli Savit led the city’s efforts to hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable for the opioid epidemic during his time with the City of Detroit. He sued banks, slumlords, and corporations whose housing policies were hurting Detroit residents. And he led the City’s landmark legal efforts to establish that all children have a constitutional right to learn how to read and write. He also spearheads the City’s efforts to make it easier for people to expunge criminal records.
Matthew Toporowski is a former prosecutor who has repeatedly challenged the over-punishment approach of his opponent, which has driven Albany County’s incarceration rate to 50% higher than the New York state average. Matt is committed to addressing structural racism by having a DAs office that reflects Albany’s diverse community, acknowledging racial bias at decision-making points in the process, and declining to criminalize poverty.
Monique Worrell is running for Orange-Osceola State Attorney in Florida and is particularly focused on criminal justice reform. She has taught and advocated a wide range of progressive criminal justice ideas throughout her career. She most recently served as the Chief Legal Officer of the Reform Alliance.
These candidates — if victorious — would have considerable power.
They can have a meaningful impact on issues like ending cash bail and mass incarceration. They can shift the focus from a failed war on drugs to issues like white collar crime in the financial sector, by pharmaceutical companies, and others.
Now $11 may not seem like the kind of money that can win these races, but when thousands of people each chip in their $11 today, these candidates will all have what it takes to win. So I am asking:
Can you split a $11 donation between 10 great progressive candidates running for district attorney, state’s attorney, prosecutor, and to our work to win progressive change? Your donation will send a powerful message while helping create change all across the country.
Thank you for making your voice heard.

317,"Today is the day we recommit ourselves to take on the incredible greed of the corporate elite and the exploitation and misery they create.
#
Friends -
Let me take this opportunity to wish each and every one of you a very happy May Day.
The concept behind May Day is extremely profound. It is the understanding that real power lies in solidarity, and that when working people in our country and around the world come together, there is nothing that can stop us in the struggle for justice. It is also a day in which we recommit ourselves to take on the incredible greed of the corporate elite and the exploitation and misery they create.
On this May Day 2020, I wanted to give you an overview of what working people are going through in this country and throughout the world and where we need to go from here.
In America, even before the pandemic, we had more wealth and income inequality than any major country on earth.
While the 3 wealthiest people in America owned more wealth than the bottom 50 percent, nearly 20 percent of our children lived in poverty.
While the top one percent owned more wealth than the bottom 92 percent, more than half of our workers were living paycheck to paycheck.
While nearly half of all new income was going to the top one percent and CEOs were making over 300 times as much as the average worker, over half a million Americans were sleeping out on the streets or in homeless shelters on any given night.
While 87 million Americans were uninsured or underinsured, the health care industry made $100 billion in profits.
And let’s be clear: The issue of income and wealth inequality is not just an American issue. It is a global issue.
Last year, Oxfam reported that the richest one percent of the world’s population owned more than twice as much wealth as the bottom half of humanity. Meanwhile, nearly half of the global population was trying to survive on less than $5.50 a day and 820 million were going hungry.
And, I might add, all of that was taking place before the horrific coronavirus pandemic swept America and the world and created an economic meltdown.
In other words, since the pandemic, a bad situation for the working class has turned into a nightmare. Meanwhile, the wealthiest people in this country and throughout the world keep getting richer and richer.
Over the past six weeks, while over 30 million Americans lost their jobs and many small businesses have gone bankrupt, Jeff Bezos, the owner of Amazon and the wealthiest person in the world, increased his wealth by over $40 billion.
While workers at Walmart continue to make poverty wages and are putting their lives at risk, the Walton family, the wealthiest family in America, has seen their wealth go up by more than $30 billion — just since March 12th.
Workers all over this country are losing their jobs, they are losing their health care, they are going hungry and cannot pay the rent. Globally, the economic disaster resulting from this pandemic could push more than half a billion people into poverty.
Neither the United States or the international community can sustain itself when so few have so much, while so many have so little. If this crisis has taught us anything, it is that we are all in this together and must create a world that reflects that reality.
The need to create an economy and a government that works for all of us has never been clearer. Now, more than ever, we need an economic bill of rights similar to what President Franklin Delano Roosevelt outlined in his State of the Union Address in 1944.
What does that mean?
It means that everyone in America who wants to work should be entitled to a good-paying job with decent benefits. How much better shape would Americans be in today if we had a federal jobs guarantee program that provided a living wage job to everyone who needed one?
It means that everyone in America should be entitled to health care as a human right through a Medicare for All, single-payer health care system. This crisis has highlighted the absurdity and cruelty of our dysfunctional health care system that ties health insurance to employment. Losing your job should never mean losing your health care.
It means guaranteeing decent and affordable housing for all, and eliminating homelessness. Before the pandemic, 18 million families in America were paying over half of their limited incomes on rent. Today, it has gotten worse. No American should be evicted from their home because they can’t afford to pay for housing. Nobody in the richest country in the world should be sleeping out on the streets.
It means the right to a secure retirement by expanding Social Security and protecting pensions. Before the pandemic, half of Americans aged 55 and older had no retirement savings. We have got to make sure that every senior citizen can retire with dignity and every person with a disability can live with the security they need.
It means that everyone in America should be entitled to a complete education — from child care through college. Essential workers should not have to worry about leaving their kids at home alone because they can’t afford child care. Young adults should not have to go deeply into debt for the ""crime"" of getting a college degree.
On this May Day 2020, let us keep our eyes on the prize. Yes. If we stand together in solidarity — Black, white, Latino, Native American and Asian American — we can create a nation of economic, social, racial and environmental justice. Yes. If we stand together in solidarity, we can stop spending trillions on weapons of mass destruction, and create a world in which all people live in peace and dignity.
The struggle continues.
In solidarity,
Bernie Sanders

“One of my opponents thinks President Trump is the most dangerous person on the planet. I’m sure Kim Jong-un and the Ayatollah love this.” - Senator Cory Gardner
It's ironic that Cory fears two dictators who have never successfully invaded any other country, while praising the war crimes committed by Trump.
But make no mistake, despite how dangerous other dictators are abroad, Trump remains the most dangerous person on the planet because he has access to the largest nuclear arsenal in the world, has a Senate that is complicit to his every move, completely eroding the checks and balances put into place by our Constitution, and is a threat to our democracy from within.

Hi Team,
On February 23rd, Ahmaud Arbery was hunted down and shot dead by two white supremists. He was only 25 years old. And today, the DA of Glynn County, Georgia, despite video of the murder, is letting a grand jury decide to prosecute these men. They have yet to be arrested.

The House is moving forward on impeachment, but it will fall flat on its face in the Senate because the current leadership doesn’t care about the Constitution, or the people. They only want to hold power to continue to corrupt our government for their own personal gain. They are making a mockery out of the oath they swore:
“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.”
Originally, this oath only consisted of the first clause, but needed to be updated after the Civil War to prevent traitors from misconstruing the oath and using it to their advantage. Yet Moscow Mitch and One-Term Cory are purposely evading their duties by protecting their lawless leader. They need to go!
Send Cory Packing with a Donation to Lorena Today!
I was in favor of impeachment ever since Trump violated the Emoluments Clause, as well as every crime after that. Nobody, not even the president, is above the law. But we need the right leadership in place to hold the Executive Branch accountable, regardless of which party is in office.
My oath will not only be to support and defend the Constitution, but to serve the people as well. There will be no pledge to party politics, just my pledge to values-based, people-centered decision making. I pledge my loyalty to YOU.
The establishment doesn’t want people like me getting into office because I will not conform to the status quo or play party politics. That’s why I’m forging a grassroots coalition across every county in Colorado, as well as across the nation. We are 100% people-funded because that’s who I will be working for.
We’re still $4,170 short of our weekly goal. Can you chip in $27 dollars, or whatever you can afford today so we can restore dignity to the US Senate and our country?
I can’t do this without you!

Alex,
General Suleimani was as guilty as they come when it comes to war crimes and crimes against humanity. Yet, the actions taken by Donald Trump on Thursday were not only beyond his limits of power, they were extremely dangerous causing even more instability in an already fragile relationship between the Middle East and the US.
The Constitution clearly gives Congress the authority to declare war in Article I Section 8, while Article II Section 2 states that the President is Commander in Chief once forces have been deployed. In fact, the framers primary concern was giving the Executive branch too broad of power concerning wars and military conflicts. Unfortunately, after 9/11, the office of the president was granted even more discretion over the Use of Military Force.
WE MUST repeal the 2001 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMFs) that has allowed Administrations to engage in assassination missions and keep our troops in an endless unofficial war for the past 18 years without Congressional oversight. Unfounded claims of “Weapons of Mass Destruction,” and now, “Imminent threats to American lives” have allowed presidents to wage wars and incite violence abroad with very little burden of proof.
Today, I will be joining hundreds, hopefully thousands at Colorado’s Capital to rally against a war in Iran at 2pm. Rallying and protesting is important to creating change and ensuring elected officials hear our voices, but that is not all we must do.
We need to elect leaders who will have the courage to defend Congress’ authority to declare war and limit the Executive’s broad interpretation of AUMFs. We need leaders who want to resolve conflicts, not incite them.
We are literally running out of time to restore Congress’ authority before another potentially very bloody conflict with no end in sight, like Afghanistan and Iraq. If you’re ready for a change, then help me take the fight to the US Senate so we can ensure that this Administration and all that follow aren’t given a blank check to wage war and put American lives needlessly in danger.
DONATE NOW TO ELECT COURAGEOUS LEADERS WHO WILL END WARS, NOT START THEM!
In Solidarity,

Alex --
The U.S. Postal Service will be gone THIS FALL without immediate help.
This would END Vote-By-Mail and spell DISASTER for the entire 2020 Election!
Congress needs to act NOW: Sign the petition to demand Congress FULLY FUND the Post Office and PROTECT Vote‑By‑Mail >>
Business Insider explains it best: (we’ve included the most important parts)
Business Insider: Trump reportedly rejected approving a bailout package that would rescue the US Postal Service, and it could be a disaster for states trying to expand voting by mail
The United States has plunged the US Postal Service into dire financial straits, as more Americans than ever rely on post offices to deliver necessary medicine and supplies, especially in underserved rural areas.
House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Gerry Conolly, who runs the subcommittee that oversees the Postal Service, sounded the alarm that the agency could run out of funding altogether by September if Congress doesn't act soon.
""Based on a number of briefings and warnings this week about a critical fall-off in mail across the country, it has become clear that the Postal Service will not survive the fall without immediate help from Congress and the White House,"" the two said in a joint statement, calling on Congress to appropriate $25 million in emergency funds to the agency.

As states have steadily expanded absentee and mail-in voting over the past two decades, the proportion of Americans voting in-person on election day has declined from 90% in 1992 to 60% in 2016, according to the US Census Bureau.
But some Republicans have openly protested expanding Vote-By-Mail options because they believe it would hurt them politically. Trump said in a recent ""Fox & Friends"" appearance that the House's stimulus provisions had ""levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.""
Since then, Trump has continued to spread misinformation about the safety and security of voting by mail on his Twitter account, falsely claiming that it ""substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD,"" which none of the available evidence on Vote-By-Mail supports.

The U.S. Postal Service is a critical and beloved institution.
And their role in delivering millions of mail-in ballots this November will prove to be critical to the 2020 Election.
But Republicans are terrified by the prospect of increased voter turnout ‑‑ so they’re determined to run the U.S. Post Office into the ground!
We CANNOT let that happen.

BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT NEWSLETTER
Below is Joe Biden’s newsletter for August 23, 2020. Please submit questions and feedback here.
Friend,
What an incredible August it has been for this campaign.
I announced Kamala Harris as my running mate, we held a one-of-a-kind Democratic National Convention all across America, and on Thursday I accepted your nomination for President of the United States.
The last few weeks have been inspiring and humbling. Getting to hear from people across the country -- friends, family, and so many other folks -- about why they’re supporting me and this campaign for the presidency is something I’ll never forget.
I’ll be frank with you, Friend: these next 72 days won’t be easy. But when I need strength, I’ll think back to this week. And I hope you will too.
I’m excited to share in this newsletter all of what the campaign has been doing in August, but for now, I’ll leave you with a line I quoted in my convention speech on Thursday from Ella Baker, a giant of the civil rights movement:
“Give people light and they will find a way.”
I give you my word, Friend: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. I will be an ally of the light, not of the darkness.
Now is the time for us to come together, to choose hope over fear, to give people the light.
Let's get to work.
Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Kamala Harris, Doug Emhoff
Campaign Updates
I couldn’t possibly sum up everything that was said over the four days of the Democratic National Convention and everything else this campaign has been up to without making this email too long, so I’m excited to share just a few highlights with you.

When I first met Brayden on the campaign trail, I saw a familiar anxiety on his face. It was the anxiety of a kid with a stutter, something I struggled to overcome when I was a kid, too. I told him then that we can’t let the barriers in our life define us, and he took that message to heart. I’m proud to be a part of his story, and of the courage this remarkable young man had to share his story with the world on the last night of the convention. Click below to watch his speech:

Jacquelyn, I hope you know -- we love you back.
Watch Jacquelyn nominate Joe Biden for President
And this campaign has been doing even more than just holding a historic convention.
Earlier this month, I announced my Agenda for the Latino Community. As president, I’ll invest in Latinos’ economic mobility, make far-reaching investments in ending health disparities by race, expand access to high-quality education, and tackle racial inequity in our education system. I’ll combat hate crimes and gun violence, and secure our values as a nation of immigrants. You can read my full plan by clicking on the images below:

And we made history in another way this month -- with the largest ad buy ever made by a general election presidential candidate. My team is planning to spend $280 million to advertise in battleground states online, on TV, and anywhere else we can reach voters.
But here’s the truth: we still have to keep fundraising to make sure we can afford to run these ads and fund our critical organizing work.
That’s why I have to ask: can you make your first donation to power our campaign to victory in November?

What’s Coming
Starting tomorrow, Donald Trump will hold the Republican National Convention. If I’m being honest, I hope you won’t spend too much time watching it -- their week is sure to be dark and divisive, and there is so much organizing work to be done on our end instead.
So here’s my ask: Will you do one extra thing this week to make sure Democrats up and down the ballot win in November? Whether it’s talking with friends and family, making calls with my campaign, or making your plan to vote, everything you do today counts. Here’s one of my favorite options:
Text Vote to 30330
Friend, we only have 72 days left in this election, and every single one of those days matters.
My campaign is hosting virtual events, running our advertising programs, and implementing massive organizing plans across the country. And I’m so glad you’re a part of it, Friend.
But running such an ambitious, historic campaign means we also have to set ambitious, historic fundraising goals. And since this is a grassroots campaign, we rely on supporters like you to reach them. That’s why I’m asking, one more time:
Will you chip in right now to power my campaign? Any amount you’re able to give will make a real difference.

I could keep reminiscing about these past few weeks for a lot longer, but that won’t help us win votes in November, so it’s time for me to wrap up.
But Friend, I hope you feel as energized and hopeful as I do right now -- for this campaign, and for our country’s future.
This is our moment to decide who we are as Americans. And I know that with you by my side, Friend, we can win this battle for the soul of the nation.
So for now -- keep the faith, and keep up the fight. We can do this.
\- Joe

Hi Alex,
I’m George Buck. I’m a former member of the 101st Airborne Division, President of the 101st Airborne Association (FL), an Army veteran, a retired firefighter injured in the line of duty, a counterterrorism and bioterrorism expert…. And I will be the one to knock out Democrat Charlie Crist in 2020!
Image
I am pissed off at what I'm seeing in our country right now.
I see anger and hate. I see ""woke"" white liberals attacking and killing black cops, black business owners, and others. I see domestic terrorists violently destabilizing the country by attacking ordinary people, attacking innocents, attacking cops performing their duty.
It makes me sick. We need to take our country back!
When the Federal government needs an expert on domestic disturbance and terrorism, it turns to me.
I co-authored the report for FEMA on the St Petersburg Riots in 1996. I was also on the ground with FEMA during the LA riots, and wrote the report FEMA submitted. As a firefighter and author of six books on disaster management and terrorism, the situation unfolding in Minnesota is of great interest to me.
Career Democrat politicians got us into this crisis. They are the ones who refuse to protect the innocent citizens being butchered by rioters. They are the ones who allowed radicalized young people to burn whole cities. They are also the ones who sat on the grievances of their constituents for decades without addressing them.
Looking at these sad sack career politicians, I think they are scared that people will see them for the absolute frauds they are!!!
See what they have done: Abandoning a police precinct to be burned. The Socialist mayor of New York criticizing the NYPD for police brutality, even as they are being knifed and set on fire (and three have died). Democrat rule is reckless and will be a blight on the city for years to come.
An on-duty New York City police officer was killed early Wednesday after a gunman walked up to a police vehicle and fired one round through a window, authorities said.
Officer Miosotis Familia, a 12-year veteran assigned to the New York City Police Department's 46th Precinct's anti-crime unit, was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, where she was pronounced dead at 3:37 a.m. ET. She was 48 years old, according to police sources.

It's not just domestic Antifa terrorists we have to worry about. There are also foreign actors driving these riots.
Federal investigators believe foreign agents are helping foment dissension and inflaming the violence that has erupted in cities across the U.S. in the wake of George Floyd’s death, Attorney General William P. Barr said Thursday.
The federal officials gathered with Mr. Barr said they’re tracking the violence nationwide, pointing to investigations into more than 800 arsons and 76 explosive devices at protests. They described the violent actors behind them, from Antifa to the far-right Boogaloo movement.
Mr. Barr called it a “witch’s brew,” and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said different groups are involved in different cities.
Image
It's time to fight these enemies - foreign and domestic. In 1992, President Bush was right to apply the Insurrection Act to quell the LA Riots. President Trump is right to assert ""law and order"" and get tough with these rioters!
I will hold the feckless career politicians like Bill DeBlasio, Lori Lightfoot, Muriel Bowser, or Charlie Crist to account. I won't let them get away with what they did to drive this crisis out of control! Will you rush back $35, $60, $100, $250, or more right now so that I can get to Congress and stick it to the harmful Fake News media?
The country is starving for leadership. And President Trump needs allies- REAL allies- right now. That’s why I’m asking for your help.
Defeating Turncoat Charlie Crist won’t be easy. He’s a career politician with powerful friends, and someone who is just a little too cozy in DC.
But as I always say, I like to kick ass and chew gum. And I am all out of gum.
Will you contribute $25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 or more to help me flip this swing seat from Blue to Red?
Beat Charlie Crist, beat Pelosi. I can do it - but I need YOUR help urgently!

I have to say what everyone is thinking: Joe Biden has no business running for any public office right now. His faculties just aren't sufficient for this kind of pressure.
But the radical Communists that surround Biden have made it clear that they will use their puppet to destroy America and our way of life. They hate us and they hate the freedom that has made America great!
When Biden ventured out of his basement, this is the tripe he comes up with:
It's clear Joe Biden's far left advisers are starting to change his stance on policing in America.
During an interview Wednesday with leftist publication This Now, Biden said the police are over militarized, have ""become the enemy"" and said funding should ""absolutely"" be reallocated elsewhere. In other words, he's advocating for the defunding of law enforcement as crime across the country continues to skyrocket.
It was just three weeks ago when Biden claimed he did not support defunding the police. In fact, he proposed an increase in funding for policing programs.
Top Biden advisor and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes has called for complete defunding of police departments across the country. Significant cuts aren't enough.
Joe Biden now says he believes ""police are the enemy"". Not violent rioters, people who murdered hundreds of people (including an 8-year-old black girl in Atlanta). He thinks those people are a-ok.... but police are the enemy?
Wow.... maybe he really IS crazy. Or weak!
One thing I know: you will never beat Biden and his radical Dems with a weak, feckless ""Vichy"" Republican.
Our opponents are tearing down statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. They are attacking police officers with impunity. They are creating ""autonomous zones"" and setting up their own laws.
We will not beat them with negotiation. We will not beat them with compromise.
President Trump knows. We are in a battle and we must win!
In a separate interview Tuesday, the president also declared, ""We are in a culture war.""
""If the Republicans don't toughen up and get smart and get strong and protect our heritage and protect our country, I think they're going to have a very tough election,"" he told RealClear Politics.
He also pushed back against “cancel culture,” wherein people have been shaming others for past social media posts they disagree with, and in some cases threatening their livelihoods by trying to use the posts to get them fired from their jobs.
“This is the very definition of totalitarianism,” Trump said, “and it is completely alien to our culture and our values, and it has absolutely no place in the United States of America.”
This guy gets it. He's a warrior for America, he's a fighter, and he will win because he fights evil and tyranny! I will join him in this fight here in Florida!
Image
Career Democrat politicians got us into this crisis. They are the ones who refuse to protect the innocent citizens being butchered by rioters. They are the ones who allowed radicalized young people to burn whole cities. They want the support of these radicals and they are willing to fan the flames of hate to burn down our country so Joe Biden can be King of the Ashes.
They hate our country and want to sacrifice it on the altar of Socialism. They will ""cancel"" your freedoms! That's not the country I fought for, and we need to stand up and fight them now so that these radicals don't take our freedoms away next year!
Republicans DO need to get tougher! Our enemies play for keeps; we must play to win also!
Image
I will NOT apologize for my country! America is the ""Shining City on a Hill"", and right now she needs patriots like you and me to defend her.
I will hold the feckless career politicians like AOC and Charlie Crist to account. I will stand up for our country! Will you rush back $35, $60, $100, $250, or more right now so that I can get to Congress and help President Trump defend our monuments and defend America?
The country is starving for leadership. President Trump needs help, the Dems are attacking him from all sides right now. That’s why I’m asking for your help.
Turncoat Charlie Crist became a Democrat because he's just like these Antifa radicals. He agrees with them! That's why I must replace him!
As I always say, I like to kick ass and chew gum. And I am all out of gum.
Will you contribute $25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 or more to help me flip this swing seat from Blue to Red? I will have the resources to send Charlie Crist and his Antifa buddies backing- but only with your help!
That's why I need your help so urgently. Our Republic needs better leaders who won't fan the flames of hate like these Liberal Democrats. We need to respect and learn our history!
Beat Charlie Crist, beat Pelosi. I can do it - but I need YOUR help urgently!

Hi Alex,
I’m George Buck. I’m a former member of the 101st Airborne Division, President of the 101st Airborne Association (FL), a patriot, an Army veteran, a retired firefighter injured in the line of duty, a counterterrorism and bioterrorism expert…. And I am fighting to make you safer!
Image
I am a constitutionalist, a Trump supporter, and I believe in defending our citizens against terrorists abroad, AND the ones rioting on our streets.
I cannot believe the Boston Marathon Bomber- a domestic terrorist- was let off the hook by liberals in the Boston courts.
Do these liberals have no shame???
When these same liberals come after me for getting tough on the terrorists, I chalk it up to them not knowing better.
You've seen it. The liberals on the editorial board of the local rag, the Swampers who like to go along to get along. I don't do that, and they know it.
I know right from wrong and I'm not afraid to say it.
But how can you not know better than to kill the guy who confessed to murdering scores of Americans in the worst domestic terror attack in 20 years???
If we don't get tough with these terrorists- and punish them like traitors- we are gonna get hit over and over (like Antifa is doing now), and innocent people will die!
The liberals just don't get it- but you won't believe what happened next!
As the Boston Marathon Bomber was being let off the hook for his crimes, liberal Boston officials cowed to pressure from Squad member Ayanna Pressley and disbanded the police unit that captured the Bomber in the first place!!!
The elite SWAT Team that captured the Boston Marathon Bomber in 2013 is set to be disbanded by local authorities; raising new concerns over national security and counter-terror operations in the region.
“The highly trained SWAT team hailed for capturing the Boston Marathon bomber in 2013 is set to be disbanded, and the city’s former police commissioner expressed concern Tuesday about how it will affect counterterrorism,” reports Fox News.
“The thing I worry about is the special expertise that these officers have in the SWAT team,” Ed Davis told Fox News on Tuesday. “They got set up a special training facility while I was the commissioner to do entries into subway cars, the ‘T’ as we call it here.”
Image
The radical Left knows only hate, and the liberal mayors have allowed them to visit too much of that on us for weeks now. They are even willing to let the Boston Marathon Bomber- a terrorist murderer- off the hook out of ""wokeness""!!!
And if Biden wins this year, that hatred will have government force to come after YOU and your family.
It's time to fight back- but I need your help!
I need to fend off the latest attack by the Swamp. President Trump has millions of Twitter followers that allow him to correct the Fake News- but I don't. That's why I need your help!
Image
I need $10,000 this week to fend off their attacks. I just don't want to let the Swamp win here in Florida, because we have seen in Massachusetts what will happen if the woke liberals get power!
I will fight for our country and for our safety! Will you rush back $35, $60, $100, $250, or more right now so that I can get to Congress and help President Trump defend our people and our country?
President Trump needs help, the way the Democrats are behaving right now. They are undermining our country; that’s why I’m asking for your help.
Turncoat Charlie Crist became a Democrat because he's just like these woke Antifa radicals. He agrees with them! That's why I must replace him!
As I always say, I like to kick ass and chew gum. And I am all out of gum.
They are picking off the free people of our country a few at a time. We need to come together now and confront them as one! Join me and we will!
Beat Charlie Crist, beat Pelosi. I can do it - but I need YOUR help urgently!

On Sunday, our community was thrown into chaos as a police officer shot Jacob Blake after he’d broken up a fight. His punishment? An officer shot him in the back 7 times, and he is now paralyzed.
Just days later, a man was murdered, and others injured, by a white nationalist at a protest over the shooting of Jacob Blake.
He walked through our streets unrestrained, and even assisted, by local law enforcement.
We all must ask the question: why was a Black man breaking up a fight shot in the back while a white teenager who’d just murdered a man was able to walk down the street past officers and return across state lines to his home in Illinois?
This question lives at the intersection of gun violence, police brutality, and racial injustice — how do we implement systemic changes to address the pressing civil rights issue of our time?
I understand that members of our communities are rightfully angry.
There will never be justice for Jacob Blake — he should have never been harmed. No action can make him whole again.
But, together, we must continue supporting our local Black Lives Matter chapters, and demanding better from our police departments.
Fixing the issues of systemic racism that are running rampant in our country will take all of us. So we must collectively stand up and speak out against these injustices.
We can and must do better.
Thank you for reading,
Amanda

352,"Ed Fallone for Supreme Court
Friends:
Ed was my professor in law school and we need his voice on the Supreme Court because his willingness to care about and help his students as well as his depth of constitutional knowledge helped guide me through law school and become the lawyer and person I am today. I endorsed Ed because his scholarly insight and his breadth of legal knowledge will bring the Wisconsin Supreme Court a perspective they need.
You know a person by how they chose to spend their time and their career when no one was watching. Ed Fallone is not just an accomplished legal scholar, and an experienced lawyer in both the criminal and civil court systems. He has also devoted thousands of hours as a volunteer, leading nonprofit organizations that provide low cost lawyers to working families in Wisconsin and that worked with at-risk youth to keep them in school and out of jail.
You can hear Ed tell his story by visiting his webpage, and clicking on the “Media” tab:
[[URL REDACTED]]
The concept of “justice” involves more than just charging crimes and imposing sentences. It involves a commitment to making the system work for everyone, without regard to how much money they have. It means recognizing that working families face challenges that other families don’t face. And it includes searching for ways to help our youth before they become defendants in the courtroom.
We need a fighter for working families on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Ed Fallone has been a fighter for justice in Wisconsin for almost 30 years.
Want to ensure Ed wins the election on February 18? Here are three things you can do:
1. Commit to ensuring 10 of your friends are registered to vote and remind them to vote for Ed. Text or email them and tell them to vote Fallone for Justice!
2. Like Ed’s page on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. The links are at the bottom of this email. Invite your friends to like his page. Share, comment, and like his posts.
3. Share the media page with all of your friends. You can share on social media or email it to your friends and family.

353,"Lizzie Fletcher Fails to Sign Abbott's Back the Blue Pledge
Today, Representative Lizzie Fletcher refused to sign a pledge to protect Texas cities from the defund the police movement. Wesley Hunt proudly signed the pledge, put forward by Governor Greg Abbott, which states:
""I sign this Texas Backs the Blue Pledge to oppose any efforts to defund the police and to show my support for the brave law enforcement officers who risk their lives to protect and serve. Defunding our police departments would invite crime into our communities and put people in danger. That is why I pledge to support any measure that discourages or stops efforts to defund police departments in Texas.
Our law enforcement officers have our backs every single day, and we need to show them that Texans have their backs.""
Efforts are already underway to cut police budgets in several Texas cities. In August, Austin’s City Council cut the Austin Police Department by one third and shortly thereafter the city of Dallas moved to defund $7 million from the Dallas Police Department’s overtime appropriations.
The far-left movement to cut funding for our police departments makes our cities less safe and puts vulnerable communities at risk. Wesley Hunt supports bringing positive reforms to our police departments but defunding the police does not accomplish that mission.
“Lizzie Fletcher's failure to sign a pledge stating that she won't defund the police should be disqualifying to voters in the 7th District,"" said Campaign Manager Jim Hilk. ""Her failure to sign this pledge mirrors her failure to stand up to the radical progressives in the Democratic party in Congress pushing to destroy Houston's energy jobs, eliminate employer sponsored healthcare and raise taxes on all Texans.""
Hunt is a Houston native and battle-tested leader willing to stand up for the 7th Congressional District. While his opponent Lizzie Fletcher made Pelosi Speaker of the House and refuses to condemn the most liberal of Democratic priorities, Wesley is a problem solver who will work with both sides to bring results home to the 7th District.

Patriot,
Our final TV ad for the general election went live this morning. Click here to watch it.
It is critical that our message gets out, so we can spread the truth about Mayor De La Isla’s reckless record. The Topeka violent crime rate has skyrocketed by almost 46% under her watch, but instead of adding police officers, she has defunded nearly 10% of police jobs, while taking lavish taxpayer-funded trips to Hawaii and LA.
We need to make sure this stays on the air. Donate Now to help us spread this message to cut through Mayor De La Isla's lies.
Here are some actions that took place under her leadership:
1. Topeka Police jobs cut by nearly 10%
2. Violent crime in Topeka skyrocketed 46%
3. While the police lost jobs, she used taxpayer money for vacations in places like Hawaii and California
In contrast, Jake LaTurner has returned over $80 million to taxpayers, because he knows every penny counts. You earned it, you should keep it. In Congress, Jake will work to jumpstart our economy with good-paying jobs from Main Street to the factory, boost take-home pay for Kansans, and bring our supply chain home from China.

SIGN ON
The Justice in Policing Act is a long-overdue first step towards putting in place policing reforms that will ensure equality for Black Americans — under the law.
This legislation will ban the use of chokeholds (which killed George Floyd), no-knock warrants in drug cases (which killed Breonna Taylor), and make lynching (which killed Ahmaud Arbery) a federal hate crime. It will improve police training and accountability and make it possible for communities to begin to rebuild trust in law enforcement.
We don’t have a minute to wait. Now is the time to reform the police system.
ADD YOUR NAME
I have never had to worry about mistreatment from police because of my skin color — but I understand that the experience of Black America is very different.
Right now, I am listening, learning, and taking action to ensure that our nation finally addresses systemic racism and white supremacy.
I am committed to working with my colleagues and community to achieve equal justice for Black Americans — which is why I am asking for your help today.

RUSH AN EMERGENCY CONTRIBUTION TODAY>>
Fellow Conservative,
Last night’s vote by the Democrats to impeach President Donald Trump marks a sad and unprecedented day in American history.
Here’s the bottom line: we have entered a new phase of American politics, where radical leftists will impeach a sitting President over nothing more than partisan politics. It’s both sad and scary!
RUSH AN EMERGENCY CONTRIBUTION TODAY>>
With Presidents Johnson and Clinton, actual laws were broken. There is no question about that.
But President Trump? The only ‘crime’ President Trump is guilty of is beating Hillary Clinton in 2016 and putting our country back on track.
Let’s be clear, this is a coup against a sitting President and the millions of people who voted for him.
Here’s what’s at stake: Democrats have gone on record saying they are likely to impeach President Trump again. It’s more important than ever to take back the House of Representatives and ensure that President Trump has the support he deserves.
I have the President’s back. I was born and raised in Congressional District 22. I actually live in the district, and it deserves to be represented by someone who understands the community and who supports the president.
This is going to be a tough race – which is why I need YOUR support to put my campaign over the edge!
Will you stand alongside me today?
For Our Texas Values,

Fellow Conservative,
The Houston area is known for many great things. But sadly, the city has a new #1 designation that no one can be proud of. Houston is now the #1 city in the nation for human trafficking. It’s a devastating fact made worse by the human suffering involved within it. This activity and its fallout affect not only the city, but our surrounding areas as well.
As we enter this new year, I want to remind you that January is Human Trafficking Awareness Month. But what exactly is human trafficking? According to the Department of Homeland Security, it is “modern-day slavery and involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act.”
Through my background as a Border Patrol agent, prosecutor, and judge, I have seen the consequences and tragedies of human trafficking. It is a hidden crime perpetrated by transnational criminal organizations, street gangs, and cruel individuals alike.
Just as I have worked to prevent and end human trafficking in my professional career, I pledge to you and those most vulnerable to continue this work when elected to Congress.
I will stand with President Trump to stop human trafficking and the flow of drugs illegally across our borders.
If you’re on board with me in this fight, please consider a contribution of $5 or $10 today.
Keep a look out this month for more information about this plague impacting our communities and what we, together, can do to end it.
For Texas,
Greg Hill

359,"# The Gavin Gazette
Just wanted to give all of our supporters some of the highlights from the past month or so. America may have been more or less under quarantine all last month, but Gavin stayed busy during this troubling time because the race for New Mexico’s open U.S. Senate seat never stops, and President Trump is counting on us for a reliable Republican reinforcement in Washington.
Gavin knows his conservative, America First #FrackChina agenda is the right antidote to the Communist Chinese Coronavirus. He wants to bring manufacturing back to America to ensure we make our own supplies in a time of crisis. He wants strong borders to keep potential threats and virus carriers out. He wants to unleash the free market to develop the resources to handle the next pandemic and spur innovation that will empower prosperity. Most importantly, Gavin wants the Chinese Communists to pay a heavy price for their role in the Wuhan Flu outbreak.
Here’s some of the highlights in the first edition of The Gavin Gazette.
Gavin Is Officially On The Ballot!
Gavin secured the required number of signatures to qualify for the primary race this month. In fact, Gavin got over 800 more signatures than he needed to qualify! His ability to attract grassroots support was demonstrated in this all-out effort. New Mexico conservatives realize President Trump needs a reliable Battle-Tested Swamp Warrior he can truly count on. Not just any Republican will do!
Gun Owners of America Endorses Gavin
Gavin received the endorsement of Gun Owners of America, a Second Amendment group with over two million members. GOA Chairman Tim Macy says Gavin is by far the most pro-gun candidate in the race.
“Dr. Clarkson understands that the Second Amendment shouldn’t be trampled on and that your Second Amendment-recognized rights are not the cause of crime in this country. He stands against expanding background checks, ‘red flag’ gun confiscation orders, and vehemently opposes gun owner registration schemes.”
New Mexico’s Red Flag Law: Most Extreme in America
Gavin fervently opposes New Mexico’s new “red flag” law that empowers liberal gun grabbers to infringe on your Second Amendment rights. He wrote an op-ed for the Santa Fe New Mexican on March 7th to warn his fellow citizens about this dystopian law.
“When the federal government wanted to subdue an Indian tribe, the first thing it did was confiscate all their guns. Now, New Mexico Democrats want to do the same thing to law-abiding citizens with the most radical so-called red-flag law passed by any state in the nation to date,” he wrote in the op-ed.
“One element that makes Senate Bill 5 the most radical in the nation is the provision trial lawyers inserted to enrich themselves, making sheriffs personally liable if they refuse to enforce it, which strips public officials of sovereign action immunity in the performance of their duties. This action creates a crisis of conscience for sheriffs who take their oaths seriously. The precedence of their personal liability is unconstitutional on its face because its intention is to threaten our sheriffs into submission,” Gavin wrote.
You can read the rest of his article, “Red-flag law shreds fundamental rights,” here.
Demanded China Pay For Coronavirus
Gavin urges our national leaders to take dramatic actions in response to the Chinese Coronavirus outbreak. He is also leading the effort to demand China pay a heavy price for its role in enabling this crisis. Check out the video here.
Gavin laid out his plan to punish China’s communist dictatorship in a March 30th op-ed for the Washington Examiner:
“Based on China’s culpability, President Trump and Secretary Steven Mnuchin should immediately extract reimbursement, starting with the $1.1 trillion in U.S. Treasury Department bonds Communist China currently holds.”
“China’s cover-up strategy directly violates its agreement to the International Health Regulations law that requires states to notify the World Health Organization of events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern. Even worse, Communist Chinese propaganda outlets have tried to pin the blame on U.S. soldiers as the origin of the outbreak.”
You can read the rest of his op-ed, “How to make China pay for the coronavirus,” here.
And a few other notes from Gavin’s Desk……
# Virus Proves the Need for Border Control
Without border security and proper immigration enforcement, dozens, if not hundreds, of virus carriers could easily stroll into our state. We cannot have radical mayors and lawmakers putting our citizens’ lives in danger for the sake of political correctness and fealty to impractical ideologies. Read more here.
# Audit All Aid to China. Then END It.
For decades, American tax dollars fuelled China’s economic rise in the form of foreign aid. We led the effort to normalize relations between China and the West, then supported dramatic increases in trade that left us dependent on China for fuel, food, pharmaceuticals, and medical manufacturing. No more! Read more here.
Can the Political Correctness on China.
The Chinese Coronavirus (COVID-19) poses a potentially huge threat to American lives and the American way of life, yet liberals worry more about what we call it. This is just the latest example of political correctness literally killing our country. Read more here.

360,"# The Gavin Gazette #2
It’s been a busy time since the last Gavin Gazette. New Mexico is still under lockdown, and Democrats want all Americans to stay home from work until the end of time. Our basic liberties are under unprecedented attack by big government, but a brave few are fighting back.
I’m doing my part to restore our God-given rights to ordinary New Mexicans.
Here’s what I’ve been up to recently…..
Led The Way On Demanding China Pay For Coronavirus
I was one of the first public figures in America to suggest seizing Chinese-owned U.S. Treasury bonds back in March. Several other major figures--including legal scholar John Yoo and Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn--are now embracing this idea. The conservative outlet American Greatness called me a “leading champion” for punishing of China.
In March, I wrote an op-ed for the Washington Examiner outlining my plan to seize Chinese assets. I followed that up in April with a second op-ed that argued for including our allies in that effort.
“The diplomatic conditions are ripe to fight back by strengthening our bonds with the hardest-hit nations, particularly those that share mutual defense agreements with the United States.
“President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo should invoke mutual defense provisions, such as Article 5 of the NATO treaty, to recruit our allies in this effort, particularly Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and India.
“Those allies will then be able to confiscate Chinese holdings, not just financial holdings, but also strategic ports around the world to which they lay claim, including so-called dual-use ports that have allowed China to project its naval power throughout the Eastern Hemisphere.”
Read the rest of my op-ed, “To make China pay, engage America's allies and seize its assets around the world,” here.
Stood Up For Sheriffs Against Unconstitutional Orders
On April 26, I promised that I would introduce federal legislation to protect sheriffs who refuse to enforce Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s unconstitutional “red flag” law.
New Mexico’s red flag law is the most extreme in the nation because it allows people to sue the County Sheriff personally for not enforcing it.
This is why I announced the POSSE (Protecting our Sheriffs from Spiteful Enforcement) Act, which allows any sheriff, deputy, or other law enforcement officer to remove a red flag tort claim to federal court, and federal courts would be barred from taking any action other than dismissal until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the constitutionality of the underlying state statute.
This would protect the constitutional rights of ordinary citizens and empower sheriffs to uphold their oath to the Constitution.
Exposed Mike Ronchetti As A Never Trumper
My primary opponent Mark Ronchetti claims to support Trump. But that’s not the case at all. My team uncovered a video of Ronchetti telling a crowd in March of 2019--not 2016--that he had left the Republican Party because of Trump.
“I’m a Christian conservative who used to be a Republican until The Orange One, then things…I’m afraid that has taken a part of my soul, and that’s not coming back,” he said.
Just over a year later and Ronchetti now pretends to support the president. Yet, he still calls his Trump-supporting critics “little Facebook trolls who are in their parents’ basement with their Cheeto-stained fingers.”
I’m the only New Mexico Senate candidate who lost their job for supporting Trump. I’m also the only candidate who has been hired by the president. That proves there’s only one real Trump supporter in the race--and it isn’t Mike Ronchetti!
Endorsed by Eddy Aragon
Albuquerque conservative talk radio host Eddy Aragon endorsed my candidacy last week. Eddy hosts ""The Rock of Talk"" on Fox News ABQ 93.7 FM and AM 1600 KIVA. Tens of thousands of New Mexicans listen to him every day to find out what’s going on in their state and country.
And he says I’m the best conservative candidate in the Senate race.
“He’s the only candidate who was hired by President Trump to serve in his administration,” Eddy said. “Meanwhile, one of his opponents left the GOP because of Trump. I know exactly where Gavin stands on the Second Amendment, illegal immigration, the sanctity of life, energy independence, critical minerals, and China. That’s why I’m proud to endorse his candidacy.”
I’m proud to have his support and that of thousands of New Mexicans just like you.
Supporting Resistance To Unconstitutional Lockdown Orders
Gov. Lujan Grisham is destroying local towns and businesses with her extreme lockdown orders in response to the Chinese coronavirus. The mayor of Grants, New Mexico, Martin Hicks, decided that his town had enough and needed to re-open to survive.
The state came down hard on him and businesses that followed his lead. One local business owner faced $60,000 in fines for the “crime” of opening up her pawn shop.
I found this outrageous and offered my legal advice to the mayor and business owners suffering under the brunt of this injustice. I understand the desire to protect citizens from the Chinese Coronavirus. Mayor Hicks and his supporters are law-abiding citizens, but they know the Democrats have gone too far in their quest to wreck the Constitution, the economy, and President Trump’s re-election campaign.
Thanks for your continued support.
I’m counting on grassroots conservative patriots like you as we enter the final stretch!

“Dr. Clarkson understands that the Second Amendment shouldn’t be trampled on and that your Second Amendment-recognized rights are not the cause of crime in this country.

“That’s why Gun Owners of America is proud to endorse Dr. Gavin Clarkson in the 2020 election.”
From Gavin:
I couldn’t be more thrilled to have “the only no-compromise gun lobby in Washington” throwing the full weight of its two million members and activists into supporting our movement here in New Mexico.
If you believe “shall not be infringed” means “shall not be infringed,” then we need to send a conservative champion to the U.S. Senate to sit on the Judiciary Committee and passionately defend our God-given fundamental rights under the Constitution.
If you’re for a “constitutional isn’t optional” approach, I’m counting on your support!

#
Alex -
Yesterday, Congressman Ro Khanna and I led 21 lawmakers in a call on Donald Trump to de-escalate tensions with Iran and prevent war in the Middle East.
We sent a letter directly to the president calling out his reckless decision to assassinate General Soleimani and demanding authorization from Congress for any military action against Iran.
We need you to add your voice to ours:
Add your name to become a citizen co-signer and tell Donald Trump not to go to war with Iran. The American people do not want another endless war in the Middle East.
Donald Trump started this situation when he withdrew from the Iran Deal and imposed crushing sanctions on Iran.
Now is the time to pursue a diplomatic strategy that will defuse tensions and prevent further movement by Iran toward a nuclear-weapons program.
Our letter called on the Trump administration to take clear steps that would not only help de-escalate the situation, but would also get us off our march to war.
As part of that, we made it clear to Trump that any further military action against Iran must be authorized by Congress. We also demanded that the administration tell the public what specific “imminent threats” existed that led to this assassination — the most extreme choice on the administration’s list of options.
We also told them not to make any further threats to Iranian civilians or cultural sites. They must recognize that this action would be a war crime and violation of our international agreements.
If you agree that Donald Trump must cease his escalations with Iran and get us off a path to war, add your name to our letter as a citizen co-signer.
War with Iran would cost untold deaths and trillions of dollars. We must do everything we can to stop that from happening.

#
Alex -
Last night, Iran attacked air bases in Iraq that house U.S. troops and personnel. Fortunately, no lives were lost, but Donald Trump must take responsibility for the lives of our servicemembers, civilians, and allies that were put in danger with his dangerous escalation of conflict with Iran.
Over the weekend, Donald Trump tweeted threats of retaliation if Iran were to strike the United States.
He said that his administration has targeted 52 sites, including cultural sites, that he would hit should such an attack take place.
Let me be very clear here: Attacking cultural sites is a war crime, and the Trump administration knows it.
Imagine if the Statue of Liberty were attacked. Or the Tao Pueblo in New Mexico. Or the memorials along the National Mall. That’s why destroying cultural sites is a violation of international law.
The United States Senate must act to prevent any further escalation and block Donald Trump from launching unlawful military actions. We are dangerously close to going to war with Iran when we should instead be working to put a stop to the endless wars in the Middle East.
Today, I introduced a resolution condemning Trump’s threats to target cultural sites, and I need you to stand with me on this issue.
Add your name now to support my resolution condemning Donald Trump’s threats against Iran. We cannot allow him to commit war crimes.
His actions over the past week have made our country less safe. We cannot allow his threats to go unchallenged.
Thank you for standing with me in this fight.

### Donald Trump Jr. & Kimberly Guilfoyle
Last week Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle were in the Volunteer State to support Bill Hagerty's campaign for U.S. Senate. They opened our first campaign office in Gallatin, Bill's hometown. Check out our recap video HERE.
### TV Ad
We are excited to announce the release of our first TV ad. You can head over to our YouTube channel to subscribe and check out all of our ads by clicking the link HERE.​
## Standing With Trump Against Impeachment
Even before President Trump was sworn into office, the radical Left and Fake News media began working overtime to impeach him. This sham trial led by Nancy Pelosi and her socialist ""Squad,"" is not only trying to undo the results of the 2016 election but also steal the election in 2020.
Bill Hagerty will stand with President Trump to put an end to this impeachment witch hunt and get our Senate back to the important business of the American people. As Tennessee's next Senator, Bill will work each day to help advance President Trump's ""America First"" agenda so that we can secure our borders and continue our winning streak by keeping America great.

Hagerty's Statement On The Passing Of RBG
For more than two decades, Justice Ginsburg served on the Supreme Court, and she blazed trails for women and believed deeply in public service. President Donald Trump can – and should – nominate a constitutionalist to fill this Supreme Court vacancy; the future of our nation for generations to come depends on it.
Read Hagerty's full statement HERE.
#TeamHagerty Stands With Law Enforcement
Last week, Hagerty announced he has earned the support of over 100 members of the law enforcement community across Tennessee. Across the country, we are seeing violence and anarchy in several Democrat-run cities, as many leaders call to defund and dismantle police departments. It is unacceptable. In the Senate, Bill will fight for the men and women who stand on the thin blue line. They put their lives on the line every day to answer the call to protect and serve our communities, and I stand with them 120 percent.

ICYMI: Under Trump, US Marks Historic Peace In Middle East
President Trump and his Administration are making unprecedented, historic strides in advancing peace in the Middle East. In the last month alone, the Trump Administration has brokered and now signed two historic peace deals: between the United Arab Emirates and Israel, and Bahrain and Israel. These are critical steps toward stability in the Middle East, which set the precedent for peace and economic prosperity throughout the region. In the Senate, Bill will continue to work closely with the Trump Administration to ensure the U.S. continues to stand with Israel and work together for peace in the years ahead.
Read the full editorial HERE.
Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! We have another election to win in November. This time, it's not just sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must reelect President Donald Trump for four more years and expand our Republican supermajority in Tennessee so we can continue to stand up to the radical liberals who want to make America a socialist country.

Last night’s tornadoes in Tennessee were devastating. Team Hagerty is praying for all Tennesseans affected by this disaster. We will continue to monitor the aftermath of this storm and will provide updates and information as it becomes available. We are thankful to President Trump for acting swiftly to work with Governor Bill Lee and local leaders to provide relief. The President will be in Tennesse on Friday to survey the devastated areas.
Tennesseans are resilient. We are strong and will come out of this stronger than ever before. Now is the time to reach out a hand to help friends and neighbors in need. To find out how you can help and to get information about resources in affected areas, visit our website HERE.
## In Case You Missed It...
Bill Hagerty released the first in a series of policy plans on Friday. ""Bill's Blueprint To Support Our Farmers"" outlines his commitment to support the 77,000 farmers in Tennessee. Bill learned the value of hard work at a young age while raising pigs and cattle and serving as the FFA president to his chapter. He understands the challenges that Tennessee farmers and agriculture workers face and will fight for them when he gets to the Senate. Be on the lookout as Bill releases more of his Blueprints to success for Tennesseans.
## Don't Miss Super Tuesday!
#TeamHagerty supports President Donald Trump because he is fighting for the American people and will protect the conservative values held by Tennesseans across the state. Today is your last chance to get out to the polls and cast your ballot for President Trump in the Presidential Preference Primary!

Mayor Rick Graham: Bloomberg's comments on farmers insulting
Our farmers must be well represented in Washington so that their products can be well represented across the globe. Bill Hagerty is running for the U.S. Senate this year and already has a proven track record of working with President Donald Trump to support our farmers, when he served as our Ambassador to Japan. I know that Bill Hagerty will work with President Trump, just as he did while Ambassador to Japan, to protect our farmers and make sure that they are treated fairly when it comes to trade. He has my support to be Tennessee’s next Senator.
Steve Osborn: Bill Hagerty’s Record Edges Dr. Manny Sethi’s Pledges
Since my meeting with the Bill, I spoke with conservative legislators in Nashville, who confirmed that Bill Hagerty is a man of faith, a conservative, and he has worked diligently for the betterment of the state. Taking everything into consideration, it is my conclusion that Bill Hagerty is the better candidate and will serve the nation and the state of Tennessee well, should he become our next U.S. Senator.
Jeff Broyles: Hagerty fights for conservatives
Bill’s broad range of experience both in business and government make him the best qualified for the job, period. He is a family man who not only displays the Christian conservative values we expect by those representing us but truly lives them in daily life. He genuinely cares about Tennesseans and is fully equipped to go to battle in Washington in our defense. After looking him in the eye, I can fully vouch for the fact that he is a pro-life, Second Amendment custodian in full support of our president’s agenda. Without hesitation, I intend to support and vote for him and humbly ask that you do as well.

One Year Of Team Hagerty
Last week, we celebrated one year since Bill Hagerty announced his campaign to represent Tennessee in the U.S. Senate. There is less than a month until early voting begins, and Team Hagerty isn’t slowing down.

NFIB Is On #TeamHagerty
The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) PAC, the largest small business association in the United States, has endorsed Bill's campaign for U.S. Senate. Now more than ever, small businesses need leaders who understand the importance of reducing regulatory red-tape in a manner that creates an environment that supports small business growth. As Tennessee’s former chief economic leader and a businessman, Bill understands what it takes to stimulate economies and help small businesses. In the U.S. Senate, Bill will be a strong advocate of Tennessee’s small businesses.

Bill's Statement On President Trump's SCOTUS Nominees
Following President Trump’s announcement of potential Supreme Court nominees for his second term, Bill released a statement praising the President for continuing to support and nominate strict constitutionalist judges. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would work to destroy our democracy – packing the courts with liberal activist judges who seek to make law from the bench. We must re-elect President Donald Trump and send Bill to the U.S. Senate to confirm strong constitutionalist nominees who will not legislate from the bench.

Mayor Dean Dickey: Why former Mayor Dean Dickey supports Bill Hagerty
In Tennessee, Bill Hagerty is the only U.S. Senate candidate that has been endorsed by President Trump. As President Trump’s former Ambassador to Japan, I know that Bill is ready to hit the ground running on Day 1 to stand with the President to fight back against the Democrats’ radical liberal agenda. He is not afraid to stand up to Nancy Pelosi, “The Squad” and RINOs like Mitt Romney. President Trump backs Bill Hagerty, and so do I.
Jeff Broyles: Hagerty fights for conservatives
Bill’s broad range of experience both in business and government make him the best qualified for the job, period.

Without hesitation, I intend to support and vote for him and humbly ask that you do as well.
Kenneth Eaton: Hagerty As US senator, Hagerty would fight socialist agenda
As the commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development under Gov. Bill Haslam, Hagerty worked with companies such as Nissan and Bridgestone to help bring hundreds of jobs to Tennessee. As our state’s next U.S. senator, I know he will support bills that will benefit Tennessee’s booming economy. He will fight for lower taxes and vote against socialists, whose expensive plans will hurt Tennesseans tremendously. According to the Tennessee Department of Labor & Workforce Development, unemployment was 3.9% in 2019 — a record low in the state. Let’s keep this record going with Bill Hagerty representing us in the United States senate. He has already proven he is the man for the job.

ICYMI: Tele-Town Hall With President Trump
Last week, President Donald Trump joined #TeamHagerty for a tele-town hall to kick off early voting in Tennessee. While speaking to Bill and Tennesseans across the state, President Trump said, ""I'm calling to tell everyone in Tennessee to get out and vote early. You can get out there and vote right now for Bill Hagerty for Senate... He was one of my earliest supporters. He worked on my campaign in 2016, and my transition after we won. He's been so great in so many ways.""
You can listen to the full tele-town hall HERE.
WATCH: Massachusetts Manny Sethi's True View On Obamacare
Today, #TeamHagerty released a new ad exposing the real Massachusetts Manny Sethi, who says one thing and does another depending on where he lives and what is politically expedient at the time. Tennesseans cannot trust Massachusetts Manny. He has been masquerading as a conservative who supports President Trump when in reality he is the most liberal candidate in the race. Watch the ad HERE and learn more about Massachusetts Manny HERE.
Early Voting Is Happening Now
Early voting is underway in Tennessee for the Republican Senate Primary. #TeamHagerty is proud to have the support of Tennesseans, including over 1,000 local leaders in communities across the state. Make sure you get out to the polls and cast your ballot to send Bill to the U.S. Senate.
You can find your polling location HERE.
WATCH: This Madness Must Stop
Our country is under attack as the angry liberal mob seeks to destroy the fabric of our country and erase our history. Next, they’ll attack our religious statues and erase our religious freedoms. Now, more than ever, we need someone with a backbone to stand up to the angry mob and protect our conservative values. In the Senate, Bill will stand tall with President Trump to put an end to this madness and support our law enforcement officers, who risk their lives every day to keep our communities safe.
Watch the ad HERE.
Join #TeamHagerty & Sen. Tom Cotton
This Friday, July 24, #TeamHagerty is hosting Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas in Clarksville, Tennessee. Sen. Cotton is a good friend to #TeamHagerty and has spoken out about his support for Bill's campaign for Senate. You can listen to Bill and Sen. Cotton's recent tele-town hall HERE.

ICYMI: Bill's Statements On ANTIFA
With the recent riots around the country, including Tennessee, Bill Hagerty issued a statement on Saturday night calling for the end of violence and looting by Antifa. Yesterday, Bill issued another statement calling President Trump to use the Insurrection Act to mobilize active-duty military forces in order to defend our communities from further acts of domestic terrorism, and the President listened! Antifa is a hate group that commits violent acts of domestic terrorism. And it's past time for it to be designated as such. Read Bill's full statement HERE.
Veterans For Hagerty
Last week, Team Hagerty released a coalition that includes over 1,200 Tennessee veterans from all branches of our distinguished military. Following the release of Bill's Blueprint To Support Our Veterans, the Veterans for Hagerty coalition has released videos sharing their support of Bill. Deputy Speaker Curtis Johnson, a member of the coalition, even published an editorial in the Leaf Chronicle stating, ""I am proud to join many other veterans across Tennessee in supporting Bill Hagerty for the United States Senate because he will stand alongside President Trump to support our veterans and make sure they have access to quality health care and job opportunities.""
Freedom is not free, and we must always take care of those who have risked so much to protect our American way of life. As your next Senator, Bill will continue to work alongside President Trump to ensure our veterans are equipped with the tools they need to transition successfully into civilian life. Find out more about Veterans For Hagerty HERE.

Congressman Fleischmann Is On #TeamHagerty
Congressman Fleischmann Endorses Bill Hagerty
Congressman Chuck Fleischmann, representing Tennessee’s 3rd congressional district, joined President Donald Trump in endorsing Bill Hagerty’s campaign for Senate last week, highlighting his business experience. When speaking about his endorsement, Congressman Fleischmann said, ""Bill Hagerty is a trustworthy conservative businessman, just like President Trump, who has my complete support. Bill’s economic background more than qualifies him for the U.S. Senate. As businesses in Tennessee and around the country begin to open again, we need someone like Bill helping lead our state. Tennesseans will be well-served with Bill in the Senate.”

In the Senate, Bill will stand strong against the predatory practices of Communist China, just like he did as Ambassador to Japan.

Bill's Statement On Tennessee Planned Parenthood
Standing Against The Angry Mob
Last week, in Tennessee, Planned Parenthood burned the American flag - they should be sent to jail. Nothing is more disrespectful than burning the American flag. Too many men and women have given their lives defending our flag and our freedoms. This behavior disrespects America and those who have been willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for our precious freedom. What we need now, more than ever, is law and order. We should defund Planned Parenthood, not the police. President Trump won’t stand for this, and neither will Bill. As our next Senator, Bill will stand up for America, and against the angry mob.

Alex,
The Chinese Communist regime’s efforts to conceal and destroy valuable evidence - including silencing their own people - regarding the Wuhan coronavirus is the crime of the century and the greatest coverup in human history.
In our new ad, we're revealing the TRUTH about China and I need your help to keep it on the air.
Help Keep this Ad on the Air
The Communist Chinese leaders must be held accountable for the death and destruction leveled on their own people and for the widespread damage to the world’s health and economy.
In the Senate, I will continue to stand with President Trump to help put an end to Communist China’s deception about the origins and the impact of this deadly virus, along with holding organizations like the World Health Organization accountable for perpetuating the Communist regime’s propaganda.

Countdown To Early Voting
We're 8 days away from the start of early voting, and #TeamHagerty is ready to support Republicans up and down the ballot. Bill is traveling across the state, from Memphis to Mountain City, to talk with Tennesseans about what's important to us. Tennesseans want to send strong conservatives to Washington this November because conservative values are Tennessee values.
We Must Fill The Seat
President Trump has a constitutional duty to nominate a Supreme Court justice to fill the vacancy created by the passing of Justice Ginsburg. Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and their radical allies in the Democrat Party want to distract and threaten in a manner aimed at preventing the President from performing his duty. Last week, Team Hagerty released a video encouraging the President and the Republican Senate majority to fill the Supreme Court seat.
Watch the full video HERE.
Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! We have another election to win in November. This time, it's not just sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must reelect President Donald Trump for four more years and expand our Republican supermajority in Tennessee so we can continue to stand up to the radical liberals who want to make America a socialist country.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett Is Confirmed
Last night, the Senate voted to confirm President Donald Trump's nominee, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat. Justice Barrett proved herself highly qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. She is a well-respected jurist – a solid constitutionalist, who will steadfastly serve our nation. Justice Barrett’s confirmation is a vital step in protecting our constitutional rights. Should the Democrats retaliate by attempting to pack the court with liberal activist judges, Bill will oppose any effort to make the Supreme Court into a rubber stamp for the Democrats’ left-wing agenda.
You can read Bill's full statement on the confirmation vote HERE.
ICYMI: Join #TeamHagerty This Week
This Saturday, October 31, Team Hagerty invites you to join Bill and Representative John Rose in Putnam County for a Kick Off The Vote breakfast. We'll be celebrating the last few days before Election Day with conservatives in TN-6 and hope you'll be able to make it!
RSVP for the Kick Off The Vote event with Hagerty and Congressman Rose HERE.
Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson's 14th annual Boots & Jeans, BBQ & Beans kicks off this Sunday, November 1 at 4:00 p.m. in Franklin. We'll be joined by conservative leaders in our state like Governor Bill Lee, Senator Marsha Blackburn, Lt. Governor Randy McNally and Representative Mark Green. Hope to see you there!
Get your tickets for the event HERE.
Election Day Is One Week Away
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! It's not just about sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must re-elect President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for four more years and expand our Republican supermajority in Tennessee so we can continue to stand up to the radical liberals who want to make America a socialist country.

Hagerty Stands With Law Enforcement
Supporting Our Police Officers | Anderson County
Over the past couple of weeks, we have seen criminals and anarchists hijack First Amendment protests with a campaign for violence and crime. Dismantling and defunding our police departments will throw our country into chaos. This is the wrong message to send. Our law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every single day to keep our communities safe. They are the only thing standing between anarchy and your family's safety. As the next Senator for Tennessee, Bill will work to uphold the rule of law, stop ANTIFA, and fight to secure appropriate funding and support for our law enforcement officers. Read Hagerty's full statement on supporting our law enforcement officers HERE.
Bill Hagerty: Endorsed By SBA List
Last week, Team Hagerty released the latest in a series of policy plans: Bill's Blueprint To Protect The Right To Life. Tennesseans value life; we believe that all people — including the unborn — are valued. In his plan, Bill details how he will protect the right to life from socialist Democrats in Washington.
As the radical liberals look to implement their socialist agenda, which includes taxpayer-funded abortions, now more than ever we need conservative leaders in the Senate to protect our unborn children. That's why the Susan B. Anthony (SBA) List Candidate Fund PAC has joined President Trump in endorsing Bill's campaign. He has always said abortion takes a human life, and we must do everything we can to be a strong voice for the voiceless. Bill will stand up to end taxpayer-funded abortions and to defund Planned Parenthood once and for all. Find out more about SBA's endorsement HERE.
RSVP: Tele-Townhall With Marilyn Musgrave
Team Hagerty announced today that the Honorable Marilyn Musgrave, Vice President of Government Affairs for the Susan B. Anthony (SBA) List Candidate Fund PAC will join us for a tele-town hall on June 10th at 2:15 p.m. ET/1:15 p.m. CT. The tele-town hall will focus on providing Tennesseans with an update on the SBA List's latest issue campaigns and how they are working to support the right to life.

Bill's Blueprint To Support Our Veterans
Last week, Bill released his latest in a series of policy plans: Bill's Blueprint To Support Our Veterans. Freedom is not free, and we must always take care of those who have risked so much to protect our American way of life. It’s crucial for the federal government to care for our military service members, who sacrifice so much. As the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Bill saw first-hand the dedication and impact of our military as they ensure the security of our nation and allies in a very challenging region. In his plan, Bill lays out how he will stand with President Donald Trump to ensure American veterans have access to the health care and benefits they were promised and have earned. Read the full plan HERE.
WATCH: Dr. Tedros Is China’s Enabler
Following President Donald Trump’s scathing letter to the World Health Organization (WHO) holding them accountable for enabling the Communist Chinese regime to misreport and cover-up valuable information regarding the Wuhan virus, #TeamHagerty released a timeline video exposing the WHO’s leader, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, for his close ties to Communist regime. Dr. Tedros has been a long time ally and enabler of the Communist Chinese regime. In the Senate, Bill will continue to work with President Trump to hold Communist China and the organizations it influences responsible for their complicity and cover-up of the Wuhan virus that put hundreds of thousands of lives and the world economy in danger. Watch the latest video exposing Dr. Tedros HERE.

READ: Bill's Latest Op-Ed In Fox Business
Bill Hagerty released an editorial in Fox Business with Andy Puzder calling out the Communist Chinese regime for acting more like a trade enemy than an ally. The op-ed, which was shared by the White House, points out the efforts of China’s Communist leadership to conceal and destroy evidence regarding COVID-19; including silencing their own people. China's actions in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 exposes the regime’s true intentions: to preserve their power and evade responsibility for their gross misconduct. Read Bill's latest editorial HERE.
ICYMI: Hillary Clinton Endorses #BeijingBiden
Last week, Hillary Clinton announced her endorsement of Joe ""Beijing"" Biden's campaign for president. Make no mistake- the two corrupt members of the Obama administration are cut from the same cloth and enrich their family’s finances from the Washington swamp. Hillary and Beijing Biden’s failed, socialist policies would increase taxes and provide fewer choices for hard-working Americans. That’s why Tennesseans resoundingly rejected Hillary at the ballot box in 2016 and will do the same for Beijing Biden in 2020. To read Bill's statement on Hillary's endorsement, visit our website HERE.

Senator Marsha Blackburn Is #TeamHagerty
Last week, Senator Marsha Blackburn joined President Donald Trump in endorsing Bill Hagerty for Senate. Senator Blackburn is the first female Senator from Tennessee, is a strong ally and defender of President Trump and a good friend to Bill.
In her statement endorsing Bill's campaign, Sen. Blackburn said, ""Bill is a true conservative, and he will always fight for Tennesseans. Tennesseans can’t afford to send someone who is conveniently conservative to be a Republican and consistently supports President Trump when it’s politically convenient.

Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! We have another election to win in November. This time, it's not just sending Bill to the Senate, we must elect President Donald Trump for four more years and stand up to the radical liberals who want to pust America into a socialist state.
#TeamHagerty Is Strong
In his latest tweet supporting Bill's campaign, President Trump said that Team Hagerty is running an excellent campaign. We couldn't agree more, and it's because of all of the hard work and support of each of you. Team Hagerty released a new video last week highlighting the hard work of our team. Over the course of the campaign so far, we have made over two million personal voter contacts.
You can see some of these moments by watching the full video HERE.
LISTEN: Tele-Town Hall With President Trump
Last week, President Donald Trump joined Bill Hagerty for a tele-town hall to speak to Tennesseans across the state.

He’s a Trump conservative, he’s a friend of mine, he's a great guy.""

Vote Team Hagerty
Over a year ago, Team Hagerty began the journey to send Bill Hagerty to the United States Senate to represent Tennesseans and fight for our conservative values. Since then, we have grown our momentum to a statewide grassroots movement. We are so proud of all the work that has been done, from knocking doors to making calls, each and every member of Team Hagerty has played a part in getting us where we are today. Now, on Election Day, we couldn't be more excited to get out to vote for Bill Hagerty and re-elect President Trump.
Watch our recap video HERE.
ICYMI: Boots & Jeans, BBQ & Beans
This weekend Team Hagerty joined Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson for his 14th Annual Boots & Jeans, BBQ & Beans. We were joined by some of the state's biggest conservative leaders like Governor Bill Lee, Senator Marsha Blackburn, Congressman Mark Green and Lt. Governor Randy McNally. Now more than ever, it is important that we get out and support Republicans up and down the ballot.
Election Day Is Here
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! It's not just about sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must re-elect President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for four more years and expand our Republican supermajority in Tennessee so we can continue to stand up to the radical liberals who want to make America a socialist country. There's still time to get out to vote, so head to the polls and make your voice heard!

Hagerty Releases Statement On Facebook
Read Bill's Statement on Facebook
Bill released a statement this morning on an explosive investigation revealing that Facebook employees were flagging and deleting posts in support of President Trump to undermine the 2020 presidential election. No social media platform should be the arbiter of what’s true and what’s not. In the Senate, Bill will continue to stand with President Trump and Senator Marsha Blackburn to ensure conservatives’ voices are protected from biased social media platforms. You can read Bill's full statement on our website HERE.

In the Senate, Bill will fight first and foremost to stop the taxpayer funding of abortions across the country, which begins with defunding big abortion businesses like Planned Parenthood once and for all. You can read the full editorial HERE and Bill's blueprint to protect the right to life HERE.

Join #TeamHagerty For Tonight's Presidential Debate
Joe Biden will finally leave his basement and answer real questions without using a teleprompter or pre-screened talking points. Tonight, the American people will have the opportunity to compare Biden's public record, nearly 50 years full of empty promises and failed policies, to President Donald Trump’s record over the last four years - a record of promises made and promises kept.
Follow along with Bill during tonight's debate HERE.

Last week, President Donald Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill Justice Ginsberg's seat on the Supreme Court. Judge Barrett is a dedicated Christian public servant — a solid constitutionalist, who will steadfastly serve our nation. The Democrats are already attacking her faith - just think of what they’re capable of doing to our religious freedom. We must support President Trump and the Republican Senate Majority and confirm Judge Barrett now.
Read Hagerty's full statement on Judge Barrett's nomination HERE.
Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! We have another election to win in November. This time, it's not just sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must reelect President Donald Trump for four more years and expand our Republican supermajority in Tennessee so we can continue to stand up to the radical liberals who want to make America a socialist country.
Are You Registered To Vote?
Early voting begins in only 15 days! Make sure you're registered to vote and are ready to support President Trump and Team Hagerty in the election this November.

President Trump Is On #TeamHagerty
President Trump Endorses Bill Hagerty
Building on his endorsement, last week President Trump tweeted his support of Bill Hagerty's campaign for U.S. Senate for the second time. First, he tapped Bill to lead his Tennessee Victory team, then to help lead the Trump Transition Team in 2016. Then the President asked Bill to represent our great nation overseas as the U.S. Ambassador to Japan. President Trump gave Bill his complete and total endorsement before Bill announced his campaign, and then President Trump personally asked Bill to join his Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups to help re-open the American economy. Now, President Trump has endorsed Bill's campaign again because he knows Bill is the ally he needs in the Senate.
You can read Bill's statement about the President's continued support in the press release HERE.
Over 1,000 Local Leaders Are On #TeamHagerty
Team Hagerty announced over 1,000 endorsements from government officials, business leaders, law enforcement officers and community leaders across all 95 counties joined President Trump in endorsing Bill Hagerty for U.S. Senate last week. We are continuing to gain momentum every day, and we can't do it without you! To read the full release announcing this grassroots coalition of support, visit our website HERE.
Follow @BillHagertyTN On Parler
Bill Hagerty announced yesterday that he has joined the social media platform Parler. Social platforms like Twitter and Facebook are censoring and even silencing conservative voices and the coastal elites of Silicon Valley are relentless with their bias against conservative viewpoints. The radical Democrats leading these social media companies will continue to censor us until we think like liberals. That’s why Bill and Team Hagerty have joined Parler. Follow @BillHagertyTN for another great way to follow along and connect with Team Hagerty. You can read the release about this announcement HERE.

Majority Leader William Lamberth of Sumner County, Bill's home county, released an editorial in the Tennessee Star yesterday endorsing Bill's campaign to represent Tennessee in the U.S. Senate.

President Trump Is All In On #TeamHagerty
President Donald J. Trump reminded Tennessee voters of the importance of sending Bill Hagerty to the United States Senate last week. This is the third time that President Trump has tweeted his support of Bill's campaign for Senate and we couldn't be more proud to have him on Team Hagerty. With endorsements from strong conservative leaders like the President, Vice President Mike Pence, Senator Marsha Blackburn, Congressman Chuck Fleischmann and Fox News host Sean Hannity, Team Hagerty has never been stronger.
Election Day Is Almost Here
Election Day for the Tennessee Republican Senate Primary is almost underway. #TeamHagerty is proud to have the support of Tennesseans, including over 1,000 local leaders in communities across the state.

Over the past year, we have had some incredible moments on the trail, connecting with Tennesseans across the state. You can see some of these moments by watching the video highlighting our strong grassroots support HERE.

Senator Marsha Blackburn recently announced her endorsement of Bill Hagerty for the United States Senate.

When Bill gets to the Senate, he will continue working alongside Sen. Blackburn and President Trump to protect our conservative values. You can read the press release announcing Sen. Blackburn's endorsement HERE.

Last week, at the Hamilton County Lincoln Day Dinner, conservative leaders, Diamond and Silk, endorsed Bill Hagerty for the U.S. Senate.

Early Voting Is Happening Now
Early voting is underway in Tennessee, and #TeamHagerty is ready to support Republicans up and down the ballot. Now more than ever, we must support candidates that will fight for our Tennessee conservative values. Bill is traveling across the state, listening to Tennesseans about what is important to them this election. It's freedom versus socialism on the ballot this November, and the choice is clear. We must re-elect President Donald Trump and vote Republican.
If you haven't already voted, you can find your nearest early voting location HERE.
ICYMI: Hagerty's Latest Editorial
President Trump has followed through on his promise to nominate strictly constitutionalists to the federal bench as a top priority. Since being sworn into office, President Trump and the Republican-led Senate have confirmed over 200 federal judges, which will have a long-lasting, positive impact on our future. Bill wholeheartedly supports Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a solid constitutionalist who will steadfastly serve our nation. In the Senate, Bill will continue to stand with President Trump and Senator Blackburn to confirm constitutional judges and justices who respect the Constitution and the rule of law.
Read Hagerty's latest editorial HERE.
Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! It's not just about sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must re-elect President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for four more years and expand our Republican supermajority in Tennessee so we can continue to stand up to the radical liberals who want to make America a socialist country.

Saturdays Should Be Game Days
Bill Hagerty released his latest editorial in the Knox News Sentinel last week calling for college football to come back this Fall. America needs football and sports now more than ever. We need a return to normalcy. We need something to bring us together. The sooner that our lives can return to a sense of normalcy, the sooner we can recover from the havoc this pandemic has wreaked.
You can read Bill's latest editorial in full HERE.
National Right To Life Is Team Hagerty
Last week, the National Right To Life Committee joined the Susan B. Anthony List in supporting Bill Hagerty for United States Senate. As a Christian conservative and a father of four children, Bill knows just how precious the right to life is. We are so proud to have yet another leader in the fight to protect the right to life join Team Hagerty.
You can read more about this announcement in the press release HERE.
Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! We have another election to win in November. This time, it's not just sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must reelect President Donald Trump for four more years and stand up to the radical liberals who want to push America toward a socialist state.
Celebrating 100 Years Of Women's Suffrage
Today is the 100th anniversary of women being granted the right to vote in the United States. Tennessee was vital in securing women's suffrage and as we celebrate this historic day - remembering the Tennesseans that lead the charge to make our state the final state needed to ratify the 19th Amendment.

Hagerty Has The Business Experience We Need
Team Hagerty released a digital video last week, highlighting Bill Hagerty’s economic experience. As a businessman and the former chief economic leader in Tennessee, Bill understands what turning around an economy takes. As our Senator, he will work to promote low taxes and a positive business environment in Tennessee and work with President Trump, Senator Blackburn and Tennessee’s Republican leadership to get our economy back on track and continue to expand our state's economy for years to come.
You can watch the full video HERE.
ICYMI: Bring Our Supply Chains Home
Last week, Bill released his latest editorial in Townhall. Under Bill’s leadership as Tennessee’s Commissioner of Economic and Community Development, tens of thousands of new jobs were created, lowering Tennessee’s unemployment rate from high above the national average to far below the national average. Bill understands what it takes to get our economy going again and that starts with bringing our supply chains back onshore.
Read the full editorial HERE.
Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! We have another election to win in November. This time, it's not just sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must reelect President Donald Trump for four more years and stand up to the radical liberals who want to push America toward a socialist state.
Are You Registered To Vote?
Early voting begins in only 43 days! Make sure you're registered to vote and are ready to support President Trump and Team Hagerty in the election this November.

Bill's Blueprint To Hold China Accountable
Last week, Bill released his latest in a series of policy plans: Bill's Blueprint To Hold China Accountable. The Communist Chinese regime has an ongoing history of engaging in predatory business, military and diplomatic practices that endanger the United States and the rest of the world. As the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Bill witnessed first hand the threat that they posed. Now, the regime has unleashed and attempted to cover up a deadly virus that has caused great devastation to the physical and economic health of the entire globe. As our next Senator, Bill will continue working closely with President Trump as we prioritize holding China responsible for the greatest cover-up in human history and for their continued efforts to undermine our infrastructure and democracy. Read the full plan HERE.
Read: Bill's Op-Ed In Townhall
Bill's latest editorial, released in Townhall yesterday, calls for the Communist Chinese regime to be held accountable for their attempt to cover-up and hide valuable information related to the Wuhan coronavirus. Communist China poses an existential threat to the United States and for too long, they have been allowed to use predatory practices against the global community. Read Bill's most recent op-ed HERE.

Countdown To Early Voting
Early voting starts tomorrow, and #TeamHagerty is ready to support Republicans up and down the ballot. Bill is traveling across the state, from Memphis to Mountain City, listening to Tennesseans about what's important to us. Tennesseans want to send strong conservatives to Washington this November because conservative values are Tennessee values.
It's Time To Confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett
As the Senate holds hearings on Judge Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court, Bill Hagerty has been outspoken calling for the Republican Senate Majority to fill the seat. Judge Barrett is a principled constitutionalist who will interpret the law NOT make it. We need to confirm more constitutionalist judges and justices to the federal bench, and Bill will work to make sure that's the case.
Sign the petition confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett HERE.
Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! We have another election to win in November. This time, it's not just sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must reelect President Donald Trump for four more years and expand our Republican supermajority in Tennessee so we can continue to stand up to the radical liberals who want to make America a socialist country.

READ: Bill's Latest Op-Ed In TN Star
Bill Hagerty released his latest editorial in the TN Star last week calling out the Washington liberals seeking to bail out the reckless spending of local and state governments. Twice now, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have held American families, workers, and businesses hostage for days by delaying relief funding in the name of securing tens of millions of dollars for the Kennedy Center, pushing her Green New Deal, changing voting laws, and growing government to advance her radical socialist agenda. More recently, there have been calls to give handouts to failing state and local governments, not because of the coronavirus, but because these states have been mismanaged and run irresponsibly. The American taxpayer should not bail out state and local governments for the reckless fiscal decisions made before the coronavirus. Read Bill's latest editorial HERE.
ICYMI: DOJ Dropped Cases Against General Michael Flynn
After years of political harassment, General Michael Flynn, former National Security Advisor, has been exonerated. The criminal cases against General Flynn were dropped by the Department of Justice after an internal memo raised “serious questions about the nature of the investigation."" To read Bill's statement on the dropped criminal cases against General Michael Flynn, visit our website HERE.
Barack Obama, Joe Beijing Biden and their administration spied on President Donald Trump during their time in office. It's time to drain the swamp. Share this GIF on Twitter and Facebook if you agree.

In response, Bill released a statement calling for families who depend on schools for healthy meals, for a safe environment and for a great education to go back to the classroom this Fall. So often the American dream is laid with a good education. That's why Bill strongly believes it’s not when we get our children back in school – it’s how. He agrees with President Trump, it’s imperative that we open our schools safely this fall. Read Bill's full statement HERE.

One Month Since Our Primary Victory
This weekend, we celebrated one month since Bill Hagerty was announced as the Republican Nominee for U.S. Senate in Tennessee. There are now 56 days until Election Day on November 3, and Team Hagerty isn’t slowing down. We're so grateful for the love and support Tennesseans have shown us throughout this journey so far. #TeamHagerty is going to keep pushing and continue our momentum until we can call him Senator Hagerty!
You can watch the full video HERE.
ICYMI: We Must Support Farmers, Walking Horse Industry
Last week, Bill released his latest editorial in the Shelbyville Times-Gazette on the importance of protecting our farmers and the walking horse industry in our state. Our agriculture industry is an essential part of our economy, bringing in nearly $75 billion of revenue per year. The walking horse industry plays a vital role in Tennessee’s economy and agriculture. Having the center of the industry in Shelbyville means that it provides a huge boost to our state’s economy. As our next Senator, Bill will continue working closely with Tennesseans to support and protect our walking horse industry, support our agriculture industry and stimulate our state economy.
Read the full editorial HERE.
Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! We have another election to win in November. This time, it's not just sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must reelect President Donald Trump for four more years and expand our Republican supermajority in Tennessee so we can continue to stand up to the radical liberals who want to push America toward a socialist state.

Listen above as Bill talks about the President's plan to open American businesses again and get the economy going again.
ICYMI: Chinese Communist Regime’s Cover-up of the Coronavirus is the “Crime of the Century”
In his latest interview with Breitbart News, Bill calls for the Communist Chinese leadership and the World Health Organization (WHO) to be held accountable for COVID-19. China destroyed samples, silenced doctors and shut down air traffic within their country before shutting down international traffic, causing the virus to spread globally, while the WHO praised their transparency and handling of the health crisis. To listen to the interview and read more about China and the WHO's efforts to cover-up the impact of coronavirus, click HERE.
Beijing Biden
For years Joe Biden has been cozying up to the Communist Chinese leadership. In 2013, he secured his son, Hunter Biden, a position on the board of directors for a Chinese private-equity fund, where he continues to serve despite announcing his resignation in October 2019. Biden is a friend of Communist China. Click to share this graphic on Bill's Twitter and Facebook.

403,"""If Joe Biden were president, China would own the United States.""
Alex,
President Trump said it best:
“If Joe Biden were president, China would own the United States.”
We just released a new digital ad revealing #BeijingBiden's troubling track record of defending China.
Watch Our #BeijingBiden Ad
As President Donald Trump stands up to China and holds them accountable for the Wuhan virus, Beijing Biden has defended the Communist Chinese regime and even parroted their talking points.
Beijing Biden’s family's close economic ties to China are well known and his track record of defending China prove that he cannot credibly lead our nation.
In the Senate, I will continue to stand with President Trump to push back against the Communist regime’s propaganda and hold them accountable for what has become the crime of the century.
You can watch the ad here.
Thank you for your time.

#TeamHagerty supports President Donald Trump because he is fighting for the American people and will protect the conservative values held by Tennesseans across the state. Make sure you get out to the polls and cast your ballot today before 7:00 p.m., or you'll have to wait until Super Tuesday on March 3rd.
## Socialist Sanders Surges in Polls
Bernie Sanders Stands By Past Comments Defending Communist Cuban Leader Fidel Castro
If you are wondering whether or not this election matters, remember that Bernie Sanders is the front runner for the Democratic Party. Since the 1980s, Bernie has fought for socialist policies, and just this week, he defended Cuba's Communist regime. This support for communist, authoritarian regimes should trouble all Americans-- Democratic and Republican. Bill Hagerty will fight against the intrusion of socialism in America and will support President Donald Trump in his work to Keep America Great.

Bill grew up with Tennessee values, and like so many of us, he truly values the sanctity of life. Bill always says, “abortion is not a human right; it takes a human life,” and he is exactly right. Bill will uphold his values and support legislation to strengthen protections for unborn children. He will also push to provide more options for mothers to turn to, such as crisis pregnancy centers, community groups, and faith outreach groups.
Sandy Still: Hagerty will support religious freedom
Bill Hagerty knows the attack on our religious freedoms is reprehensible and cannot be tolerated. He was raised with Christian conservative values and instilled those values on his four children. Bill, who is endorsed by President Trump, is running for the United States Senate in Tennessee to protect our religious freedoms.
Michael Tedder: In support of Hagerty’s U.S. Senate bid
If you think our health care system is broken now, just wait until the federal government takes over. And their Medicare-for-All plan is going to cost at least $32 trillion dollars, which would more than double our national debt. I believe this will destroy our country as we know it. Bill Hagerty is running for the United States Senate to combat the radical socialists and their agenda. I know Bill will stand with President Donald Trump to protect my conservative values and the conservative values of so many Tennesseans across the state.

ICYMI: Read Bill's Op-Ed in The Chattanoogan
Last week, Bill released an Op-Ed in the Chattanoogan addressing the serious issue of human trafficking in Tennessee and across the United States. Since 2007, in Tennessee, there have been 823 human trafficking cases reported, with 93 cases reported in 2019 alone. In his piece, Bill calls for a crackdown on websites and social media accounts that promote human trafficking, ensuring local agencies have the resources they need to educate our community on how to spot human trafficking and report it to law enforcement and violators to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law -- including the death penalty.

Sandy Still: Hagerty will support religious freedom
As our next Senator, Bill will continue to stand with President Trump against radical liberals who seek to restrict our opportunities to speak about our faith and important values. President Trump and Bill Hagerty will faithfully stand for our Tennessee values and I proudly stand and support them.
Kenneth Eaton: As U.S. Senator, Hagerty would fight socialist agenda
The Democrats running for president would destroy our economy with their socialist takeover of our health care system. Their plan would cost trillions of dollars and take away the insurance you get at your job. That’s why it’s very important that we send a senator to Washington, D.C., who understands how dangerous this is and who will stop the Democrats’ extremely liberal agenda. I believe that representative is Bill Hagerty, a fiscal conservative running for the United States Senate who is endorsed by President Trump.
Mayor Dean Dickey: Why former Mayor Dean Dickey supports Bill Hagerty
In Tennessee, Bill Hagerty is the only U.S. Senate candidate that has been endorsed by President Trump. As President Trump’s former Ambassador to Japan, I know that Bill is ready to hit the ground running on Day 1 to stand with the President to fight back against the Democrats’ radical liberal agenda. He is not afraid to stand up to Nancy Pelosi, “The Squad” and RINOs like Mitt Romney. President Trump backs Bill Hagerty, and so do I.

406,"President Trump was acquitted on a party-line vote.
Kim Olson for Congress
Alex,
Just now, the Senate acquitted President Trump of his crimes with all but one Republican voting not-guilty. The Republicans in Congress made it clear that they would fall in line putting party over country and continue to enable Trump’s dangerous and reckless behavior.
Are you surprised?
Mitch McConnell and his cronies fixed this trial from the beginning. They were open about their lack of impartiality and denied the American people a fair trial.
What’s even worse: They blocked witnesses with more incriminating evidence against the President from testifying.
Are you still surprised?
The GOP believes Donald Trump is above the law of the land, and this is why we have to vote them out.
With one month until Election Day, we need grassroots donors to stand up against the Republican machine too afraid to defend American values. I am the pragmatic, proven leader needed in Congress. Have you chipped in yet?
Stand up with me,
Kim Olson
Kim Olson is a farmer, combat veteran, and champion for education. After 25 years in the Air Force, Kim served three years in the Texas State Guard and started a non-profit to help women veterans.

Alex,
In the days since Trump ordered a drone strike on Qassem Soleimani, he has only exacerbated what was already a crisis.
Trump all but declared war on Twitter. He threatened to commit war crimes, vowing to target Iranian cultural heritage sites if Iran strikes back. He has no plan to deal with this disaster of his own making.
Ilhan is doing everything in her power to prevent another disastrous war. This week, she introduced a resolution to stop the military from taking action against Iran without congressional authorization.
Ilhan needs this grassroots movement behind her. She asked us to get 102 more signatures from Minneapolis to make sure Congress hears us loud and clear. Add your name to tell Congress: No war with Iran!

Subject: Add your name: Congress must stop Trump from starting a war in Iran!
Alex,
Let this sink in: Donald Trump recklessly assassinated a foreign official and has no plan to deal with the consequences.
We don’t know for sure if he’ll start a war in Iran. But we do know that he wants war, knows his actions could spark war, and could use the distraction from his impeachment scandal.
It’s my constitutional duty to intervene when a president tries to overstep congressional authority. I will use the full power of my office to stop him — and I’m calling on my colleagues to do the same.
But we need every voice to rise up and demand that Congress stop Trump from recklessly starting an endless war. I need 92 people from Minneapolis to stand with me. Click here to be one of them.
Sign the petition
There’s no doubt that Qasem Soleimani was a violent, murderous man. But instead of exploring different approaches to the conflict, Trump ordered an airstrike without congressional approval.
We are currently engaged in a number of wars that have no end in sight. We can’t afford to enter another war that destabilizes regions, creates massive humanitarian crises, and further undermines our moral authority around the world.
Congress must step up and make sure this president’s reckless actions don’t get us into another war. I’m calling on you to be one of the 92 people from Minneapolis to demand that Congress hold Trump accountable.

408,"Trump is riling up Islamophobes
Alex,
When the United States enters conflicts with Muslim-majority countries, it destabilizes nations and infringes upon human rights.
It also riles up Islamophobes and racists at home.
I've seen it on Twitter, where my calls to avoid a war with Iran were met with Islamophobic slurs and tropes in my replies. We've seen it at the U.S.-Canadian border, where dozens of Iranians and Iranian-Americans have been held for questioning for no reason at all.
From 2003 to 2007, we saw alarming rates of death threats, vandalism, and violence against Arab-Americans and others assumed to be of Middle Eastern heritage.
Violent rhetoric turns into violent acts.
Several of this president's hateful policies are rooted in Islamophobia. He's already empowered Islamophobes with the Muslim ban and his decision to accept the lowest amount of refugees in modern history. It will only get worse as he recklessly pushes us closer to an endless, unnecessary war with Iran.
Muslims should not have to keep living in fear of death threats and violent hate crimes simply because of their religion. Even as I make progress as one of the first Muslim Congresswomen, I face constant threats and hateful rhetoric.
The times we're in call for all of us to work harder to stamp out hate. If we stand together and speak truth to power, we can put Islamophobia in the dustbin of history where it belongs.

409,"Will you sign my petition supporting the Abolish ICE movement?
Alex,
Earlier this week, news broke that ICE has been forcefully sterilizing immigrants in detention centers — a hallmark of genocide that’s internationally recognized by the United Nations as a crime against humanity.
Time and time again, ICE has proven to be a cruel, unaccountable agency, rooted in racism, sexism, and a reckless disregard for the safety and well-being of immigrants and refugees. On top of the chilling allegations of mass hysterectomies, ICE has a well documented track record of abuse, neglect, and misconduct from guards sexually assaulting and harassing detainees to employees refusing to test and treat detainees with COVID-19. There must be a full reckoning with the torture and cruelty this administration has caused immigrants — and that starts with abolishing ICE.
Will you join the movement to abolish ICE right now by adding your name next to mine?
I SUPPORT ABOLISHING ICE
Since the Bush administration founded ICE in 2002, ICE has established itself as an agency designed to hurt, dehumanize, and terrorize immigrant and refugee communities. It has only become increasingly militarized and unaccountable over the years, and the movement to abolish it is grounded in the goal of creating an immigration system based on humanity and compassion. As the pandemic only exacerbates the unsafe conditions in ICE detention centers, it’s clearer than ever that the time to completely dismantle ICE is now.
ICE has proven itself to be beyond reform. Add your name right now to support the Abolish ICE movement.
Thank you for speaking out.

# Qualls Files for Congress
## First in Line and First to File with Minnesota Secretary of State
Plymouth, Minnesota – Kendall Qualls, endorsed Republican candidate for Congress in Minnesota’s Third Congressional District, today officially filed for office with the Minnesota Secretary of State. Qualls will face first term Democratic incumbent Dean Phillips in the November general election.
“While our campaign has been going full speed since entering the race last August, today makes it official,” said Qualls. “I wanted to be the first in line and first to file today to show the residents of the Third District that I’m ready to put my business turnaround and healthcare experience to work for them on day one,” stated Qualls.
Qualls, a U.S. Army Veteran and newcomer to politics, was overwhelmingly endorsed by Third District Republicans on April 30. The only one in his family to attend college, he grew up in the crime ridden ghetto of Harlem, NY, before upgrading to a trailer park in Oklahoma. After his Army service, he worked for Fortune 100 companies in the healthcare industry, including Johnson & Johnson, Roche Labs and Medtronic/Covidien. He now works for a small healthcare startup that helps cancer patients tackle their disease.
“Over the course of my life, I’ve been called many things–ghetto kid, trailer trash, veteran, businessman, husband, father–but I never dreamed I’d be called candidate for U.S. Congress,” said Qualls. “As your congressman, I’ll dedicate my efforts to moving people toward a goal that is larger than each individual and transcends racial, economic and gender differences. And in doing so, we’ll build bridges that will make America better, stronger and more united than ever before,” Qualls concluded.
# # #

# We Must Promote Two-Parent Families to Heal our Wounds
As the Twin Cities and our leaders look to rebuild, consider needed reforms in policing, and pursue justice for George Floyd, the enduring question is how to address the consistent disparities between African-Americans and other ethnic groups. It is time we address an uncomfortable truth. The chief barrier to the advancement of the African-American community is the rise of single parent households - not racism, police brutality, or white privilege.
Our country will not meaningfully resolve the significant economic, health, and educational disparities between black Americans and other groups until we address the single parent household crisis plaguing the African-American community.
We can do this through legislation, community engagement, and by shifting values in the African-American community to emphasize two-parent families.
The Dramatic Rise of Births Outside of Marriage in the African-American Community
The detrimental impact on children of their parents not being married was first described over fifty years ago in the Moynihan Report. The Moynihan Report concluded that in a majority-black community, the main predictor in growing up poor was not race but being born to parents who were not married.[1]
The single parent crisis has only worsened since the Moynihan report was issued: the black community has experienced almost a tripling of unmarried births. In 1965, 25 percent of child births in the black community occurred outside of marriage.[2] Today, it is 69.4 percent: 68 percent in urban areas 79 percent in rural areas.[3]
Children Born to Unmarried Couples are Less Likely to Succeed
Children born to unmarried couples are less likely to succeed educationally, emotionally, and financially.[4] Children born in single-parent homes are more likely to have contact with the criminal justice system, resent authority, join a gang, and have substance abuse issues. They are also more likely to suffer from mental health issues, obesity, poverty, homelessness, and child abuse. The effects are multigenerational: less-educated parents are less likely to marry and it begins a cycle of entrapment in the underclass.[5]
I don’t need the data to tell me this. I’ve seen it firsthand in my own family.
My Firsthand Experience with the Single-Parent Crisis
I was born in 1963, the year before Lyndon B. Johnson began the war on poverty with a series of well-intended government programs. In 1968, my father returned from the Vietnam War and my parents divorced. My mother moved my four siblings and me from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where my father was stationed, to live with my grandparents in Harlem. On our first day there, we were robbed on our way to my grandparent’s apartment – it was the middle of the day and there were no police officers in sight (that is the reality when police officers are “removed” from the community).
There was a common theme in the public-housing project that we lived in and the school I attended: there were mothers and children, but an absence of fathers. The only men in the neighborhood were drunks, drug addicts, or drug-dealers. For three years, that was my world. I saw the stressful and worried look on my mother’s face every night when it was time for bed. New York City never sleeps and in Harlem the screams, crime, and violence never seemed to end. My mother, despite her best efforts, could not raise all five us in that environment. My father came to Harlem and retrieved my brother and me to live with him in Oklahoma.
I am younger than all of my siblings and cousins. Between my age and the geographic divide, which resulted in semi-regular visits back east, I was able to watch them over the decades and see how their fatherless existence and personal decisions impacted their lives. The outcomes were similar to what is emblematic in the African-American community: poverty, crime, drug addiction, and joblessness. Most did not marry and they had kids outside of marriage. If they did marry, the marriages were short-lived and ended in divorce.
Of my four siblings, three went to prison. All four used drugs. One became addicted to heroin and contracted HIV/AIDS from intravenous drug use. He later died from complications related to AIDS. Sadly, my nieces and nephews followed a similar path: high school dropouts, drugs, joblessness, and dependency. Last year, my 42-year-old niece died from a drug overdose.
How to Address the Single Parent Crisis
The story of my extended family is emblematic of the crisis plaguing the African-American community. America has made significant strides in combating racism. However, the African-American community is mired in self-inflicted wounds and a mindset of victimization. The Democratic policies of the last fifty years have only exacerbated the issue.
We can address the crisis through legislation, community engagement, and by shifting values in the African-American community to emphasize two-parent families.
* Federal legislation to remove the marriage penalty in government programs and provide a tax deduction for those who complete marriage preparation.
* Support and promote nonprofits that include education on the value of marriage and the negative impact father absence has on children and the community.
* Partner with schools, community leaders, and Black churches to extol the values of marriage for children and for married couples.
We Must Acknowledge & Address the Single Parent Crisis in Order to Heal
Given the dramatic rise of births outside of marriage, it is no surprise that we continue to see the African-American community underperform and disproportionally suffer from incarceration, violence, and interactions with the police. This is no excuse for brutality and we must pursue policing reform. But we must also examine the hardened realities of police officers before we castigate the entire group for the actions of a few, let alone abolish police forces entirely.
The flashpoint of the last several weeks does not have to be a repeat of the flameout in 1968, 1992, or 2014. Instead, we should turn George Floyd’s tragic death to a re-examination of the single parent crisis in the African-American community and the government polices enabling men to abandon their responsibilities. As Barack Obama rightly declared, the “hole a man leaves when he abandons his responsibility to his children is one that no government can fill.”
Let us remember this lesson as we seek to rise up from the ashes of Lake Street, pursue policing reform, and rebuild our community. In doing so, we must candidly discuss how the single parent crisis that reverberates across America hurts us all, whether we acknowledge it or not.

# America the Exceptional: My Response to Dean Phillips and his Vision of America as Systemically Racist
Kendall's opponent, first-term Democratic Congressman Dean Phillips, has attempted to convey the Black-American experience and redefine America in the process. On June 22, Dean Phillips emailed his supporters and stated that ""Racism is deeply [[URL REDACTED]] our institutions, and in our everyday lives."" On June 23, he posted a message on Facebook to reiterate that message. He also created a ""resource guide"" on his website for ""racial justice allyship"" to “understand our nation’s” black experience and combat ""systemic racism"" in America.
Kendall Qualls, as a Black-American descended from slaves, takes umbrage with Dean’s characterization of America as a systemically racist country. In its place, Kendall offers a vision of hope because ""America is an exceptional place full of exceptional people” with opportunity for all. Kendall’s full response to Dean is below.
Kendall Qualls – In response to my opponent, Dean Phillips, and his attempt to convey the Black experience and redefine America in the process, I’m going to tell you what it’s really like to be a Black man in America.
My opponent’s virtue signaling insults me, and it should insult you too. Dean Phillips got his degree in Urban Studies from an Ivy League School in the Northeast. I got my degree in Urban Studies from the streets of Harlem in New York City.
Yet, unlike him, I’m not going to lecture you on the evils of white people, or guilt you into believing that “white privilege” makes you personally responsible for slavery and the struggles Black people face today.
I’m not going to lecture you like he did by telling you “racism is deeply ingrained in our history, in our institutions, and in our everyday lives, and white people [like you] have benefited from it.” I’m not going to lecture you from a place of privilege as the third wealthiest member of the House of Representatives and tell you racial justice will only be achieved if you “forgo” your comfort and take the blame as a white person.
I’m also not going to sit idly by as statues topple, and they tell you our history needs to be erased or rewritten. Why? Because I don’t believe it.
Like you, I know the overwhelming majority of white people aren’t racist. But as a Black man I am going to tell you that if you look for racism in America you will find it. At the same time, if you look for opportunity in America you will find it tenfold.
I am also going to tell you that in spite of spending part of my childhood in a crime and drug-infested housing project in Harlem, in spite of spending the other part in a trailer park in rural Oklahoma, and in spite of having to work nights and weekends to put myself through school, I made it.
I made it because America is an exceptional place full of exceptional people. And there are millions more just like me who made it – white, black, brown, and everything in between.
However, my opponent and his progressive comrades across the nation are using the tragic death of George Floyd to fuel the flames of racism and create a smoke screen to cover up how they failed our cities, our country, and the Black community.
When I was in high school, I remember big city politicians and urban elites calling America racist because Black-Americans struggled in the inner cities. Not much has changed. Black-Americans still struggle, the same urban elites dominate the conversation, and yet they present no fundamental plan for change. Empty platitudes and a reading list for white people won’t solve the struggles in the Black community.
Those on the left tell us “we have to have the tough conversations” about race. I agree. Let’s have the “tough conversations” by looking at the real barriers to progress:
* Progressive politicians and urban elites that want to shift accountability from the failed programs they’ve championed and benefited from the past 50 years.
* The destruction of two-parent Black families through social programs that discourage marriage and result in generational welfare.
* Policies that limit educational opportunities, prohibit school choice, and protect teachers' unions, preventing prosperity in the process.
This story isn’t being told in the halls of Congress but, rest assured, I won’t be afraid to speak truth to power. I won’t be afraid to “have the hard conversations.”
This election is about our country’s direction. We must fight the ideology of destruction and those who promote the vision of America as a systemically racist country. We must fight those who enable and spread this vision, paving the way for mob rule in the process.
My opponent can independently fund his political campaign from his trust fund. In fact, he already has. Do I begrudge him for his wealth? No, because this is America and everyone has a right to pursue prosperity and happiness. But I do take umbrage of his characterization of America given all that this country has given me and my family.
I’m not afraid to tell you that life isn’t fair. Like all countries, America has its imperfections. But with faith and hard work, you have the freedom in this country to overcome your circumstances and build a better life. I’m proof of it. I want to protect the freedom that allowed my opponent’s family to prosper, allowed me and my family to improve our lot in life, and make sure that freedom is here so you and your family can prosper too.
Today, we have a unique opportunity to put forth a model for racial healing and economic prosperity for all. The truth is when Black Americans prosper, we all prosper. But we will not get there by destroying monuments to abolitionists, removing pictures of Abraham Lincoln from the Minnesota House Chamber, or defunding police in the communities that need it most.
Instead, we must take action – in Minnesota and across our nation. We must speak up, protect our history, and promote principled solutions to heal our nation.
If we don’t, who will?

<<First Name,>>
We are facing a challenging time. With only a few days to go and early voting starts in the Tennessee Primary, the country’s calls for Criminal Justice reform grow louder & louder.
A central piece of our campaign is to abolish the inequities in our environment, justice, health care, and education system to strengthen our democracy.
The best way to fundamentally change our way of life is through restorative justice. Restorative Justice focuses on the harm caused by crime and, ultimately, the healing of all parties involved. It focuses on transformative alternatives. Our current structure only increases recidivism and benefits the for-profit prison system. We must ensure that everyone stands equal before the law and rehabilitate offenders. We must stop the school-to-prison pipeline.
####
Our campaign is focused on a win for The People–not for the large businesses or established power in Tennessee that exploit our systems. Now is our opportunity to make justice available to everyone, no matter the zip code. Furthermore, we can’t do it without your support. Every one of your contributions is making a meaningful difference. Can we count on you?
We will win together!
Onwards!

An Important Note From Marquita Bradshaw:
* * *
My spirit moved by seeing this hashtag #WeAreDoneDying. The mother of 25-year-old Ahmaud Aubrey will not have her child this Mother's Day. This was a hate crime with gun violence. One is too many when it comes to innocent blood. The false sense of privilege fueled by racism that spills innocent blood will only stop when we elect leadership that design policies to protect black, brown, and red bodies from the structural racism.
We have to participate in making this democracy reflective of our shared values by voting, engaging others to vote, and holding our three branches of government accountable. #WeAreDoneDying translates for me- I'm done chasing the symptoms of racism, gun violence, health disparities, poverty, over-incarceration, subpar education, environment degradation, addiction, lack of healthcare, lack of mental health services, and lack of equity. The strategy to be a better America is to publicly demonstrate, litigate in the courts, engage in all aspects of the political process.

# Sussex County Sheriff Mike Strada endorses Frank Pallotta for Congress
Sussex County Sheriff Mike Strada endorsed Frank Pallotta for Congress today. Sheriff Strada won re-election 68 percent to 32 percent in the Republican primary and with 94 percent in the General Election.
“I am endorsing Frank Pallotta today for Congress in the Fifth District,” Strada said. “Frank Pallotta stood with Sussex County and stood with me against the Murphy administration’s attempts to do away with effective border controls.”
“The battle we fought last year, on behalf of the people of Sussex County, has been proved right by the deadly virus we are now facing. Border controls are vital to the safety of our nation, our communities, and our families. Frank Pallotta stepped up and stood with us when we needed help. As a member of Congress, I know he will step up and fight for Sussex County and all the communities of the Fifth Congressional District.”
Frank Pallotta paid tribute to the service of Sheriff Strada: “Mike Strada is fighter and a leader. As a platoon leader in Iraq, as a police officer fighting crime, and as an elected County Sheriff keeping residents of the district safe, Mike Strada has shown he has what it takes and I thank him so very much for his support. It is an honor.”
New Jersey’s Fifth Congressional District includes parts of Bergen, Sussex, Passaic, and Warren Counties.

# I. Spotlight: End of Quarter/Voter Contact Efforts Unleashed!
It has been an incredible past few weeks! On September 30th we closed out our final quarter before the election and are proud to have raised over $175,000! Thank you so much to everyone who chipped in to bring back integrity to CD-4.
We are putting this money to work by ramping up our voter contact efforts with print advertising, billboards (scroll down to see our newest one in Longmont), digital ads, and radio!

# II. Latest news
## Ken and Ike Debate Tonight
Ike and Ken Buck will debate for the first time tonight at 4pm at American Legion Post 82 in Elizabeth Colorado. This is the first time Ike and Ken will go head to head. Check out our facebook and twitter for staff coverage of the debate, and then join us on Saturday night for a post-debate watch party where we will watch the recorded video of the debate. RSVP for the event here
It will be moderated by the Fort Morgan Times and covered by CPR News, Colorado Politics, and The Denver Post.
## Spanish Language website and billboards up!
We are proud to have unveiled a series of 3 Spanish language billboards in Greeley and Longmont. Additionally we have also unveiled our spanish language website.
For far too long Latinx voices have not been heard in CO-4. When hard laborers including Saul Longoria Sanchez died at the JBS plant in Greeley Ken Buck who's in the pocket of big business stayed silent. Buck paints all members of the Latinx community as unamerican even though they are just as American as he is and many families date back to before Colorado joined the Union.
Ike not only recognizes this but also realizes that the pandemic and economic crisis has hit the latinx community harder than most and that they have received less help than white communities. Ike will fight hard for every constituent equally, can you chip $5, $25, even $50 to help us expand our spanish language outreach efforts?
## Ike Speaks At Action 22
Ike spoke at an event held by Action 22 in Pueblo last week. For 15 years Action 22 has fought to bridge the urban rural divide by providing programs, workshops, and projects for the betterment of communities in southern Colorado.
# III. In The Media
CPR News has released its 2020 voter guide. You can find Ike and Kens stances on the major issues here.
Last week at Ikes home in Parker several political signs were stolen from his yard, destroyed, and thrown into the street. Here is the denver post's story.
# IV. Upcoming Events
Native American Community Meet & Greet
On Saturday morning Ike will meet with Tribal Leaders at 10 AM at Margie's Java joint in Greeley to discuss the needs of Native Americans in the district.
Pro-15 Northeastern Candidate Forum

## Colorado
Colorado Politics- Weiser joins states in asking for injunction against Postal Service changes
Attorney General Phil Weiser has joined 13 other states in filing a federal request for an injunction against the Trump Administration, seeking to prevent the U.S. Postal Service from making disruptive policy changes before the November election.
“We are fighting for an enforceable court order that ensures that the harm that has already occurred is corrected and prevents the Postmaster General from playing games with the mail service in the future,” Weiser said in a statement.
Colorado Sun- Judge dismisses lawsuit seeking to hold up blue book printing over Gallagher Amendment language
A Denver District Court judge on Friday morning dismissed a lawsuit attempting to delay printing of the state-issued voter guide because of changes state lawmakers made to language describing the question on the November ballot seeking to repeal the Gallagher Amendment.
Judge Martin F. Egelhoff declined to issue a temporary restraining order that would have prevented the so-called blue book from heading to press.
Greeley Tribune- New $32M fund to help Colorado schools, colleges address COVID-19 impacts
Colorado public schools and universities can apply for financial help from a newly launched $32 million fund created by Gov. Jared Polis that’s intended to support learning institutions and students hit hardest by COVID-19.
“What this $32 million is designed to do is to go to the areas most impacted, because in many ways, COVID-19 accentuated the already existing achievement gap that falls along income, race and geography,” Polis said in an interview Wednesday.
## District 4
Greeley Tribune- UNC Outdoor Pursuits offers community organizations ways to connect during COVID-19
With COVID-19 requiring social distancing and causing workplaces and schools to function through virtual platforms, people are craving connection with others now more than ever.
The University of Northern Colorado’s Outdoor Pursuits is helping those experiencing isolation from the lack of in-person relationships regain some of those connections through programs like its ropes course.
Parker Chronicle- Douglas County School District superintendent resigns
Douglas County Superintendent Thomas Tucker resigned Tuesday evening.
Tucker cited personal matters as the driving force behind his resignation during an emotional emergency meeting, which he called with school board directors. Tucker’s family still lives in Ohio, he said, and his mother is battling serious health complications.
“It has been my pleasure, my distinct pleasure, to work with the board and school staff and serve the students and parents of Douglas County,” Tucker said. “I am proud to serve as your superintendent.”

# Democrats are coming for your guns!
Democrats are coming for your guns! This is not an attempt to scare you because we are in an election season. No, it is a very real possibility. I am not even talking about pending horrible legislation, like H.R.5717, in the Democrat-controlled House. I am speaking of what just took place in St. Louis, Missouri, on Friday evening, when police, at the behest of Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner, a Democrat, literally stripped Mark and Patricia McCloskey of their constitutionally protected right to keep and bear arms because they dared stand in defense of their property and persons from an angry BLM mob who had invaded their property in protest.
The Democrats have shown that they care not a whit for law and order, as they have helped promote BLM and have covered for the numerous crimes being committed by their legion of followers throughout the nation. This appalling and indefensible assault on this couple's constitutional rights, is the result of Gardner promising to go after them.
Let the record reflect, despite the Democrat and media narrative to the contrary, that the protestors who were in front of this house had members who were armed (there are pictures), that some were hurling threats of violence, that protesters were not on a public road, and that this couple was merely defending their property, in keeping with the 2nd Amendment and Missouri’s Castle Doctrine!
Despite all of that. Gardner obtained a warrant to go and get the weapons that had been wielded by the McCloskeys, an Ar-15, and a handgun. How did a judge even sign off on the warrant? Why didn’t law enforcement officers refuse to execute this order that was clearly a violation of these people's Constitutional rights on its face? Our law enforcement officers swear an oath to the Constitution above all else. Literally, no crime was committed by the couple, and the warrant didn’t say one had been, only that the guns were being taken. Now, this couple has no weapons and has hired twelve armed guards to protect them, and it’s a good thing they did, because the protestors had made another pass at their home on another day.
We are in very dark times, and there is one party, the Democrat Party, that simply refuses to obey the laws of this land, and apparently has judges willing to help them in the enforcement of unjust orders in direct defiance of the Supreme Law. The Constitution literally means NOTHING to the Democrat Party. They must all be thrown out of Congress, and we must have elected officials who will stand and vociferously defend our rights, no matter what the political flavor of the month is.
I hope you will join our winning team to unseat Ann Kirkpatrick by donating or volunteering. Together, we will take Congressional District 2 back.
I am relying on you -- my grassroots supporters -- because this election is about you - Giving you more liberty and allowing you to keep more of your hard-earned money. Your donation of $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, or whatever you can afford will IMMEDIATELY help my campaign.

# The 17 Crimes & Errors of the FBI Team Who Spied on Trump
For those who haven't yet read the IG report (or don't have the time), but aren't buying the ridiculous spin from the MSM, I have taken the liberty of providing you a summary of the 17 listed FISA abuses by the FBI core team, led by James Comey, Andrew McCabe, and Peter Strozk.
Remember, the FISA process allowed the FBI to declare an innocent, U.S. citizen, Carter Page, a Russian agent, so they could in turn spy on Trump’s team.
The IG report shows, albeit in a very opaque manner, that the FBI agents in charge LIED. REPEATEDLY.
The specific lies, or deceptive behavior from the Crossfire Hurricane (CH) core team, BEFORE the FIRST FISA application are as follows: [All of this information was kept from the court.]
1\. Carter Page was an asset for another U.S. agency against Russia!
2\. According to sources, Christopher Steele, the man who crafted the dossier of alleged Russia/Trump team connections, was not the pristine, and trustworthy agent the CH team claimed he was. Quite the opposite.
3\. They KNEW one of the sub-sources of Steele was unreliable.
4\. The FBI willfully lied about who Steele had contacted with his materials.
5\. George Papadopoulos, while talking to an undercover FBI contact, DENIED that anyone associated with the Trump campaign was collaborating with Russia or with outside groups like Wikileaks in the release of emails.
6\. Exculpatory material for Page that totally undercut KEY Steele findings about Page's alleged close association with Paul Manafort.
7\. Again, exculpatory material about Page in his contacts with several Russian oligarchs, which also undercut Steele.

6. Exculpatory material for Page that totally undercut KEY Steele findings about Page's alleged close association with Paul Manafort.
7. Again, exculpatory material about Page in his contacts with several Russian oligarchs, which also undercut Steele.
The FBI small unit NEVER started being totally honest with the FISA court as they sought 3 more renewals of the original warrant to spy on Page. If anything, the lies became more brazen.
As more information was gathered, 10 additional significant lies/distortions/exemptions occurred regarding the 3 renewal FISA applications:
1\. In January, 2017, the Primary Sub-source for Steele, told the FBI that he and Page NEVER talked about Wikileaks, and stated there was nothing wrong with Kremlin/Trump team discussions (think normal diplomacy). Also, he DID NOT tell Steele Page had met with Sechin (notorious oligarch).
2\. Page worked specifically for the CIA as a source. This was told to the FBI as late as June 2017, yet was not told the FISA court. In fact, the exact opposite was.
3\. The FBI was told, by multiple sources, that Steele lacked good judgement, liked to pursue things for political purposes, and had no way or plan of validating his own report.
4\. Steele was an entirely political actor in the crafting of, and promotion of his Dossier who ""desperately wanted Trump defeated.""
5\. Once the small team KNEW (meaning, they couldn't deny it) that Steele was working directly on the behalf of the Democrat National Committee (DNC), they NEVER reported this.
6\. The small CH team NEVER corrected the deception they perpetrated in the original FISA filing that one of their “corroborating” pieces of evidence for Steele (a September 2016, Yahoo article) was actually sourced by Steele!
7\. The core team was told by FBI source validation that Steele’s past work was only “minimally corroborated”, yet, they continued to report that Steele’s prior work had been “corroborated and used in criminal proceedings.”
8\. Papadopoulos literally told an FBI informant that the Trump campaign was not involved in the DNC email hack.
9\. Joseph Misfud, a Maltese professor, DENIED sharing information with Papadopoulos that Papadopoulos allegedly then relayed to Australian High Commander Alexander Downer, which was the supposed predicate for the investigation being opened.
10\. Claims that the Republicans changed their platform regarding Ukraine to appease Russia (which was factually a lie), were fed into the FISA application and said to come directly from Page’s involvement with the Russians. Page played no role at all in the crafting of the platform.

If you, like me, are utterly appalled by this behavior you can await Barr/Durham and hope for arrests, but you can also DEMAND action now by voting for new members of Congress who will actually uphold the law, rather than making up crimes to pursue a sham impeachment against President Trump while whitewashing the crimes of those they support. I will be that kind of representative.
I hope you will join our winning team to unseat Ann Kirkpatrick by donating or volunteering.

# Only Politically Useful Black Lives Matter To Democrats
America has just come through a second week of protests, riots, civil unrest, and a healthy dose of criminal behavior in the name of social justice following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The mantra “Black Lives Matter” is one that is supposed to speak to the alleged institutional racism that exists in the American, criminal justice system, and of which Floyd was a victim. Yet the disingenuousness of the call to action to protect black lives is immediately exposed when you consider that little outcry from the people in the streets is given to the black lives that have been taken or ruined as a direct result of the protesters in many of these inner cities.
My opponent, Ann Kirkpatrick, has taken to endlessly virtue-signaling on her social media page putting out this monstrous lie on Saturday.
▪ When your ""justice system"" doesn't practice justice, it's just oppression: If you are white, you're innocent until proven guilty. If you are black, you're guilty until proven innocent. Presumption of innocence shouldn't be based on skin color. We need systematic change.
▪ When your ""justice system"" doesn't practice justice, it's just oppression: If you are white, you're innocent until proven guilty. If you are black, you're guilty until proven innocent. Presumption of innocence shouldn't be based on skin color. We need systematic change.
Nothing in that statement is even remotely true. But the current crisis has allowed Kirkpatrick and other Democrats to make more generic calls for reform and change, and of course, to engage in baseless race-baiting.
Nothing is said though about their Party’s policy culpability in the disintegration of the black family and the high crime rates in minority communities, nor of course can any of them speak up for the black lives destroyed in these “protests”. They are not politically useful.
Kirkpatrick and her ilk remain silent on the death of Officer Miosotis Familia, an on-duty New York City police officer was killed early Wednesday after a gunman walked up to a police vehicle and fired one round through a window, authorities said.
Silent on the destruction of a black 69-year-old storeowner in the Bronx, Lucy Hosely’s business. She had this to say as she tried to pick-up the pieces of her store left by looters, “We’ve been here all night cleaning up. [They] tell me ‘Black Lives Matter.’ They’re lying.”
Silent on the death of David Dorn, 77, a retired black, police chief, who was shot dead by looter in St. Louis as he went to check on a friend’s shop when burglar alarms sounded.
Silent on the death of Chris Beaty, a former Indiana University football player, who was shot and killed on the street in downtown Indianapolis this weekend during one of these riots.
Neither she, nor any of these opportunistic panderers, has said a thing about the innocent black lives taken during the protests they justify, the black officers killed, the black business owners' lives that have been destroyed, which shows just how dishonest and politically motivated it all is. We can and must do better.
I hope you will join our winning team to unseat Ann Kirkpatrick by donating or volunteering. Together, we will take Congressional District 2 back.

# Dems 'Justice in Policing Act' Leaves No Justice for Police
Another week has passed, and the politicization of George Floyd’s death continued apace as the Democrats in the House of Representatives passed their Justice in Policing Act. This bill would have been better named the Injustice against Police Act, as it perpetuates the worst lies of the left regarding systemic racism and creates a nightmarish “justice” system that would overburden law enforcement with more needless oversight, cataloging and highlighting every little misstep.
Here are the most egregious things in this bill.
▪ Define a “death resulting” as any act that was a “substantial factor contributing to death”. - This would create a nightmarish scenario where lawyers could find almost any reason to find a “substantial factor” and take legal action against law enforcement.
▪ Using the lie that the Trump administration has “undermined” the ability of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division to investigate discriminatory and unconstitutional practices, the bill proceeds to “fix” this by granting subpoena power to the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, to conduct pattern and practice investigations. In other words. The Civil Rights Division would essentially have an autonomous power outside of the Chief Executive. This would be entirely unconstitutional.
▪ Creates a grant program for state attorneys’ general to create an independent investigation process for law enforcement misconduct or excessive use of force. - This means more lawyers and activists to “find” crimes against law enforcement paid for by the taxpayer
▪ Creates law enforcement development programs to craft policing best practices. - Who doesn’t like more government programming?
▪ Requires the Attorney General to collect data on ridiculous things such as “the racial distribution of drug charges” and traffic and pedestrian stops and detentions. - This is because the assumed systemic racism is such that non-whites are obviously targeted more by these things and hence another bureaucrat must be appointed to collect all this data.
▪ Establishes a National Police Misconduct Registry. - They want to assume that there are all these bad cops that just go from job to job. Can you imagine a National Teacher’s Registry for all the horrible teachers protected by unions? This is an appalling idea, especially since they would be looking for “crimes” by police.
▪ Requires States to report to the Justice Department any incident where use of force is used against a civilian or against a law enforcement officer. The reports must include, for example, the following: The national origin, sex, race, ethnicity, age, disability, English language proficiency, and housing status of each civilian against whom a law enforcement officer used force. - This is such an obvious and ridiculous provision, which again assumes that police are only looking to go after groups of people who have been classified as “minorities” for Democrat political purposes.
▪ End Racial and Religious Profiling Act. This bill provides a straw man statistic to illustrate that this is a problem and claims that blacks are more likely to be picked up for selling drugs; it then puts forward this provision: Prohibit federal, state, and local law enforcement from racial, religious and discriminatory profiling and create a cause of action for declaratory or injunctive relief. - This is the key: provide for legal action to be taken if the police should do this kind of profiling. Profiling is an ESSENTIAL part of police work!
▪ Mandates law enforcement provide training on racial, religious, and discriminatory profiling. -More virtue-signaling nonsense that would create more bureaucratic red-tape, and of course assumes that police are systemically racist.
▪ Conditions federal funding to state and local law enforcement to force them to adopt these and the other policies. - There is going to be little recourse to “opt-out” of this nonsense.
▪ The bill would make it a federal crime to conspire to violate existing hate crimes laws. - Who is doing this? How would this even be provable?
▪ Define a “death resulting” as any act that was a “substantial factor contributing to death”. - This would create a nightmarish scenario where lawyers could find almost any reason to find a “substantial factor” and take legal action against law enforcement.
▪ Using the lie that the Trump administration has “undermined” the ability of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division to investigate discriminatory and unconstitutional practices, the bill proceeds to “fix” this by granting subpoena power to the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, to conduct pattern and practice investigations.

▪ The bill would make it a federal crime to conspire to violate existing hate crimes laws. - Who is doing this? How would this even be provable?
This bill would absolutely do great damage to America’s law enforcement and, maybe, that’s the point. The radical Marxists who run the Democrat Party are not interested in supporting law enforcement. They are interested in pushing their political agenda of social justice, an agenda which requires a reimagining of America at its very core. This would take away ALL local control, and create a centrally controlled, politically focused police state. Sound familiar? The only way to stop this is to vote every single Democrat out of power.
I hope you will join our winning team to unseat Ann Kirkpatrick by donating or volunteering. Together, we will take Congressional District 2 back.

424,"Today, I, along with a majority of my colleagues in the House of Representatives, voted to impeach the president.
This is only the third time in our nation's history that a president has been impeached. That's not something I take lightly.
But when Trump asked the Ukrainian president to do him a favor and investigate his political rival, I had to take action to defend our Constitution and the foundation of our democracy.
I've read the full report from the Intelligence Committee and it's crystal clear: President Trump abused his power and violated his oath of office to protect and defend the U.S. Constitution.
Moreover, testimony from his own administration officials confirmed the president withheld congressionally-approved foreign aid to Ukraine to further pressure the nation to interfere in our elections on his behalf. Even the White House Chief of Staff publicly admitted it.
These are disgraceful offenses. They're crimes. In fact, the House Judiciary Committee found Trump committed bribery and wire fraud. His despicable actions shatter the trust the American people place in our leaders. He must be held accountable, and impeachment is the only appropriate response.
Our work to hold Trump accountable doesn't end with the two Articles of Impeachment; this president has spent the last three years consistently, almost constantly, abusing the power of the presidency to elevate, indulge, and enrich himself and his family – regardless of the threats to our national security or the core values of our democracy.
And so, while the impeachment process is moving on to the Senate, as Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I will continue the investigation into Trump's violation of the emoluments clause.
I will continue to issue and enforce Congressional subpoenas – even when I have to ask the courts to step in.
I will continue to investigate any conflicts of interest between the presidency and Trump's businesses.
We must continue to keep our eyes open, and not only because these issues could lead to further Articles of Impeachment; the integrity of our national security and the health of our democracy depend on it.
Onward,
Peter

425,"Here's what's coming next:
Senate Republicans have openly – and shamelessly – let Donald Trump off the hook for his crimes, and they suppressed evidence, ignored facts, or just flat-out lied in order to make it happen.
Now that they've acquitted him, you can bet they're reaping the rewards from Trump's special interest campaign supporters who are determined to keep Trump in office. Even scarier, Trump now thinks he's above the law and is the law.
We're up against Super PACs, industrial polluters, and those looking to rig the system in their favor. Some days, it feels like the cards are stacked against us.
But what they don't know is that we actually have the winning hand. We've got a grassroots movement of thousands of working people, fighting just to give everyone a fair shot at the American dream. The fight of our lives is coming in November and we've got to stick together.
Our movement is working for the people, not the wealthy elite, and together we will achieve victory in November. Chip in $3 before our midnight deadline to fuel the fight!
I have never been afraid to stand up for what is right, and I know you're with me.
In unity,

426,"Andy Meehan will help re-elect President Trump & ensure that Republican voters have a real voice. But Andy can only accomplish this with your help.
Pennsylvania Is A Key State for Trump In 2020:
ANDY MEEHAN IS KEY TO MAKING
PA-01 REPUBLICAN AGAIN
* * *
Andy Meehan can & will help re-elect President Trump & ensure that abandoned Republican voters have a real voice. But Andy can only accomplish this with your help.
* * *
For the first time since 1984, the Republican Party in Pennsylvania has an opportunity to re-elect a Republican President. If we can accomplish this, the 1st District in Pennsylvania will likely be the key to keeping this all-important Electoral College state as a win for President Donald Trump.
Historically, Pennsylvania votes blue, primarily because of the strength of the unions who are more often than not endorsing Democrat candidates. As you know, Donald Trump won Pennsylvania by only about 44,000 votes in 2016. And Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016.
With an abysmal record of supporting President Trump, incumbent Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick has voted with Democrats 75% of the time. Congressman Fitzpatrick votes with Nancy Pelosi more than any other Republican in Congress. Fitzpatrick has been a disgrace to the label of “Republican”… a label that Congressman Fitzpatrick publicly asked people to stop calling him.
Andy Meehan has a very real opportunity to help re-elect President Trump & ensure Republican voters in the 1st district are properly represented, but he can only accomplish this with your help.
Andy Meehan’s message of “America First” is striking a chord with the people of this district who are tired of Congressman Fitzpatrick’s support for red flag gun confiscation laws, amnesty, carbon taxes, constant condemnation of President Trump, & silence on sanctuary city policies. Andy Meehan boldly stands against each of the destructive policies championed by “Republican” Brian Fitzpatrick.
The citizens of the first district care about these major issues. Brian Fitzpatrick has failed to deliver on any of the issues that put our district, & the American people first. That’s why Congressman Fitzpatrick has an “F-Grade” on 2nd Amendment rights from the NRA, & an “F-Minus Grade” on Immigration from NUMBERS USA.
Meehan for Congress campaign would like to start a major media push in our district detailing Andy’s plans to turn our district around. THE MEEHAN AGENDA is laser-focused on more jobs, less crime, & addressing healthcare & education issues facing our long-neglected district… where conservative, Trump-supporting voters have been ignored & abandoned, suffering the worst loss of Republican offices in 30 years.
Andy Meehan is the only conservative, Trump-supporting, Republican choice in this important Congressional race who will defend your interests in Washington. But he can’t do it alone! So, we are asking for your help in two ways.
First, Meehan for Congress needs financial support to fight back against an opponent who has amassed more than one million dollars from anti-gun groups & special interests from outside PA District 01. With your help today, Meehan for Congress can begin telling Andy’s story of decency, integrity, honesty & personal dedication to truly help PA-01 citizens, rather than just using them for votes to retain political power, as Democrats & Brian Fitzpatrick have done for so long.
* Please go now to [[URL REDACTED]] to donate $10, $20, $50, $100 or up to $2,800 today to help us win this very important race. To mail your donation, please make your check payable to FOAM: FRIENDS OF ANDREW MEEHAN & mail to PO BOX 1153, SOUTHAMPTON, PA 18966. Your donation today will be the key factor helping Meehan for Congress WIN.
Next, Meehan for Congress needs volunteer support to get out the vote & work the polls for the RESCHEDULED JUNE 2, 2020 Republican Primary in PA District 01. President Trump needs your votes to ensure his reelection in November, but he also needs real Republican allies in Congress. Andy Meehan will be an ally for President Trump, & for YOU in Making PA-01 Republican Again.
* Please go now to [[URL REDACTED]] to get Meehan for Congress Yard Signs, attend free weekly Town Hall Conference Calls, help work at polling places, offer to host a Fundraiser, make phone calls, & help our Campaign. Please share our message with family, friends, & everyone you know so they can do the same!
Working together, we can win this critical district in Pennsylvania, & ensure the re-election of President Donald J. Trump in 2020, when our District & our nation needs him more than ever.
Now more than ever, may God bless each of you, your families, & America.

427,"Friend,
I’ve said it before, but this week has truly brought home the fact that we MUST bring accountability and ethics to the U.S. Senate. During these impeachment proceedings, we have witnessed some staggering levels of cowardice and attempts to cover for a corrupt administration.
Iowa’s Sen. Ernst leads the pack in enabling this out of control president. Her blatant support is nothing short of sickening. In the midst of what should be a serious and solemn impeachment proceeding, she’s tweeting her support for Trump’s war crime:
The stakes are so incredibly high this year, and right now, our campaign still needs to raise another $30,868 in January to grow and expand our field and voter outreach programs. This is the crucial work that must be done now for us to win. Can you chip in during this critical month?

Alex --
Right now, we are in a cycle of escalation with Iran, with every moment carrying the potential to draw us into a wider war.
Our nation is at the brink of war, but our Commander in Chief has not provided a comprehensive plan or course of action. In a matter of 24 hours, he’s flipped from threatening to bomb cultural sites in Iran (a move that both Democrats and Republicans condemn as a war crime) to echoing Obama’s previous Iran strategy to avoid another war.
Trump’s yo-yo foreign policy is evidence that his administration does not have a solid strategy in place and that he is willing to put American lives at risk in the process to formulate a clear plan. In fact, several Democrats and Republicans were unimpressed by Trump’s briefing this week, with one Republican calling the briefing “insulting” and “probably the worst briefing I’ve seen, at least on a military issue…”
It’s time for Congress to stand up and carry out their duty under the Constitution. We must hold Congress accountable to prevent another endless war that puts American lives at risk and will cost billions of taxpayer dollars.
West Michigan -- and the country -- deserve leaders who understand the gravity of their actions and take their responsibilities seriously. We do not, and will not, tolerate leaders who carelessly make threats with no clear strategy behind their decisions.
Please add your name below to send a clear message to Congress, demanding our leaders form a clear, comprehensive strategy to de-escalate the situation in Iran and to stop Trump from further politically-motivated actions of war without authorization from Congress.

Friends,
It's no secret that my opponent values money and personal connections more than the well-being of his constituents -- but this article that appeared in The Post and Courier last week ([[URL REDACTED]]) gives us insight into just how bad it is.
Last year, William Timmons nominated George K. Lyall, a family friend of his, to be a judge in South Carolina's magistrate court. Nominating family friends for important judicial positions is questionable enough as is, but Lyall's nomination is particularly egregious. In the 1990s, Lyall pled guilty to stealing nearly $100,000 from accounts he managed.
George Lyall is a criminal guilty of stealing tens of thousands of dollars, and he's now putting low-income South Carolinians in prison when they can't afford to pay traffic tickets. Asked about Lyall's past, Timmons said that ""even with that, you’re not going to find somebody with more experience in the courtroom"".
Lyall's nomination is not only a reflection of how corrupt Timmons is, but it also a reflection of how broken our criminal justice system is. Poverty is treated like a crime, and wealthy white criminals like Lyall can steal $100k and face virtually no repercussions.
If you weren't already convinced, I hope this shows you just how critical next year's election will be. Big corporations and groups like the NRA continue to fund Timmons' campaign, but I'm relying entirely on you all.
Can you rush a donation now to help me beat Timmons and turn SC-04 blue? ([[URL REDACTED]])

[[URL REDACTED]]
Friend,
If you’re wondering what’s being done about violent ANTIFA rioters and the crimes they’re committing by assaulting police officers, looting small businesses, and burning cities across America, the answer is not enough.
When these radical rioters are rightfully arrested for their crimes, left-wing prosecutors release them from jail and allow them to wreak more havoc in the streets. This is not only dangerous to thousands of innocent citizens residing in American cities -- it’s eroding a sense of personal responsibility.
What makes it even worse is that violent ANTIFA rioters who have been arrested and convicted of crimes are still eligible for unemployment benefits set aside for those impacted by COVID-19.
You read that right: the very same dangerous convicted rioters who are burning down small businesses are stealing the money those business owners need to rebuild after the pandemic.
I’m leading the fight in Congress to STOP this and prohibit anyone who is convicted of looting or other violent protest-related crimes ineligible to receive coronavirus unemployment benefits.
I’ve made it clear where I stand on this friend, but I want to know what you think. Will you take a quick minute to take our CRITICAL survey and share your thoughts?
Should convicted rioters be eligible for unemployment benefits?

Friends,
There’s a lot of people in Washington that are afraid to stand up to the mob -- but Rep. Jim Banks is not one of them.
Let me cut to the chase -- the mob wants Joe Biden to be president because they know he’ll let them get away with anything. Right now, Washington Democrats are 100% focused on lining the pockets of the ANTIFA thugs destroying our cities.
That’s why my father needs strong representatives like Jim Banks in Washington. Jim is standing strong and immediately halting all taxpayer money from going to the violent members of ANTIFA who have been arrested and convicted. Jim is leading the charge in Congress to prohibit anyone who participated in violence or looting during protests from receiving any coronavirus aid.
Jim is exactly what we need in Washington. He’s a veteran, father, proud Hoosier, and strong supporter of our President. He’s fighting to hold the ANTIFA mob accountable and stop the destruction of our cities.
I’m fighting to send Jim back to Washington, but I need your help. Jim is fighting hard to STOP the mob, so will you join me in fighting for our values and Jim?
Support Jim
My father needs Jim to Keep America Great. Will you join me in supporting Jim?

GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT OR INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN REPUBLICAN
Nancy Pelosi has officially ordered articles of impeachment. While the House Democrats reveal that there is no proof or evidence, House Democrats continue to show facts and evidence don't matter- they will proceed. In their view, You are guilty until proven innocent, or innocent until proven Republican.
The liberals focus on the impeachment of President Trump and neglect their real work that our elected officials -like Jared Golden- are expected to do, is the real crime. While President Trump continues the work to pass UMSCA, build the wall, lower our taxes, fight the opioid crisis, and promote business growth, the Democrats would rather betray voters who elected them and play political games.
We don’t have time to play games. These articles provide Democrats like Jared Golden with is a funding stream to continue to pushback on President Trump.

For Immediate Release
December 18th, 2019
Contact: Jonathan Moynahan; [[URL REDACTED]]
Dale Crafts Statement on Congressman Jared Golden’s Impeachment Vote:
""Make no mistake, Jared Golden’s vote today was a betrayal on not only Maine’s second district, but also on our Country. His vote was nothing more than a weaponized protest vote. Since September the House Democrats, including Jared Golden have held their elected offices hostage to the work of the American people. This historic, political, and partisan betrayal vote is a rebuke of all the successful accomplishments President Trump has worked so hard to achieve in just 3 years. While President Trump has continually worked to improve the country (by, bringing in roughly 4 million jobs, lifting 3.9 million Americans off of food stamps, signing right to try legislation, working to secure our borders, and awaiting to sign the USMCA; which would have a significant positive impact on Maine farmers) the Democratic party has been fixated on impeachment since the election of 2016.
Jared Goden stated that President Trump ""abused his power."" The real abuse of power was being a complicit accomplice to Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler’s process of this impeachment inquiry. The other abuse of power is firing an impeachment vote at a duly elected President for crimes that no evidence can sustain. Out of all the witnesses that were paraded in front of the house committees, not one could provide first hand knowledge of what took place, only hearsay and circumstantial evidence.
I had hoped that Jared Golden would choose to vote with his constituency and not be strong-armed by his own party. We need representation that will not bend to the wishes of their party and do what is right. Being in a wheelchair for 36 years and a businessman all my life, I can confidently tell you, “No one will ever strong-arm Dale Crafts.” Throughout my business career, I have learned to negotiate and work with different opinions in difficult situations to provide the best possible outcome. I have developed a lot of skills and negotiation is one of my strongest. This is a skill I believe Jared Golden and many others in Washington do not have.
Mainer’s deserve more from our elected officials, and as your Congressman, I will always pick the Maine people’s side and not the socialist agenda that is ripping our country apart.""

District 2 GOP primary – Claire Chase
Chase is a first-time candidate, but she’s not new to the political scene, having been an advocate for the oil and gas industry for seven years. Chase was the first woman and youngest chairman of the New Mexico Oil & Gas Association and was also president of the Independent Petroleum Association of New Mexico. She and her husband own Mack Energy of Artesia and a pecan farm in Eddy County, another important industry in the 2nd District, which spans the southern half of New Mexico. Her extensive background in the O&G industry enables her to be a strong advocate for thousands of oilfield workers in a time of tremendous strife.
Chase also has experience on Capitol Hill, having worked for former U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce and former Sen. Pete Domenici. She says she learned how to fight from Pearce and how to be a statesman from Domenici. The New Mexico Military Institute high school graduate and mother of 3-year-old twins says she got into the race because younger, conservative leaders need to step up.
She says her priorities include securing our border, which will help improve the economy and decrease the crime rate, and she believes Congress needs to increase checkpoint funding and the worker visa program, especially for those in the oil and gas and agricultural industries. She says 2nd Amendment rights are important to her district and dedicated mental health funding is the way to address the “broken people” caught up in drugs and crime. And as the granddaughter of a base commander, she wants to ensure those in New Mexico stay strong.
The winner in the GOP primary will face incumbent U.S. Rep. Xochitl Torres Small, who is unopposed in the Democratic primary.

Friend,
The future of our country and our state is on the line. Chaos, anarchy and violent crime has gripped cities across New York and our leaders have turned their backs on the brave heroes in law enforcement who keep us safe.
While Cuomo, de Blasio and New York Democrats seek to limit the rights and freedoms of law-abiding New Yorkers, dangerous criminals are allowed free rein.
That is why I am writing to you today to ask you to renew your New York Republican Party membership for the 2020 election cycle.
This is no time to sit back--our mission is more critical than ever. Democrats in New York have already delivered a disastrous end to bail laws that are putting violent criminals right back onto the streets. They have already gutted the NYPD's budget and they won't be happy until they have completely dismantled everything that makes our country so special.
We’re counting on loyal members like you to help us ensure our strong Republican candidates have the resources they need to fight back against this extremism.
According to our records, you have not yet renewed your New York Republican Party membership for the 2020 election cycle.
Make sure you stand up and are counted. If you don’t renew soon, you will miss access to critical information about the 2020 election cycle, including President Trump’s reelection and our important congressional and state legislative races.
You must act now.
Get your exclusive 2020 NYGOP Membership Card TODAY!
President Trump is counting on us to deliver him a big re-election victory, and he told me personally how important it is to him to win right here in New York.
We worked tirelessly to recruit strong Republicans to run for office and I’m so excited about the slate of new fighters who are running this year to restore common sense and balance to government.
Everything is on the line.
Restoring two-party government is essential to New York’s future. Our wins this year will preserve the New York Republican Party for the next decade after redistricting.
Democrats’ extreme policies have already driven more than a million New Yorkers to other states and we are facing an even greater mass exodus thanks to coronavirus and the unraveling of our public safety.
We cannot afford to let this radical agenda gain a permanent foothold in New York.
We can stop all of this NOW, and we WILL.
It’s time for common sense to make a comeback in New York and it starts now with the NYGOP.
As a sustaining 2020 member, you will play a vital role in our New York GOP operations. If we’re going to win again, we’re going to need every member to renew their commitment to the NYGOP.

440,"Hi ,
AOC's war on cops never ends. She started by attacking the NYPD's budget and saying that it was ""unethical"" that the biggest city in the U.S. has the biggest police budget.
Now she's attacking the police use of tear gas, which prevents police from having to use deadly force, and attacking police use of facial recognition, which helps them catch criminals.
It won't be long before she's calling to take guns away from our officers and leave them as helpless as the police are in Europe!
The only way to end AOC's war on cops is to defeat her this November. Help me finish her political career with a quick $25 donation to our campaign right now.
DONATE NOW
As a former NYPD officer myself, I can see where our police departments need reform. Less lethal options should be encouraged and body cameras should be required.
But trying to take away less lethal options, like teargas, will only encourage police officers to use greater force when it comes time to stop rioting and looting. While it is still an unfortunate option, it's better for police officers to use tear gas to disperse a crowd than for them to use their billy clubs.
Furthermore, police use of facial recognition isn't ""racist"". It helps our dedicated law enforcement officers catch criminals who would otherwise remain on our streets. Police have every right to use technology that makes their jobs more effective.
AOC should try spending a day in the shoes of our hardworking police officers before she dares to tell them how to do their jobs.
When I defeat her this November, I'll be putting an end to her ignorant attacks on our police. Join our campaign to defeat this anti-cop socialist right now with a one time donation of $35 or more.
The hardworking families of the Bronx and Queens that I've gotten to know over the past year of campaigning don't want to live in a city without police. They don't want the police department defunded because they know that will mean more crime in our neighborhoods and schools.
While our district is heavily Democratic, voters here are willing to vote for a Republican like me because they know I'll stand for law and order.
Police reform is quickly becoming the deciding issue of our race, and it has AOC scared. She knows how unpopular her ""defund the police"" position is within the district, and she knows it's threatening her reelection.
I have a real shot at defeating her this November, but I need your help to fight back against the millions of dollars she's going to spend attacking me.
Make a generous contribution of $60, $85, $110 or more to our campaign right now and help me stay in this fight. It's a long way to November, and I need the support of grassroots conservatives like you to keep going.

Cummings For Congress
Alex,
The clock's winding down! We have less than 100 days to bring down AOC!!
Millions of dollars are flooding in to salvage AOC's flagging campaign after her dismal primary performance. That means we're preparing for AOC to launch a barrage of TV ads attacking me, law enforcement and President Trump.
AOC will say anything to protect her cushy role as America's Socialist darling.
You can help me bring her down in November by making a small contribution so we can get our ads on the air and show voters the devastation AOC has brought to our neighborhoods.
Bring down AOC
– CONTRIBUTE NOW –
AOC continues to be a constant source of embarrassment for Pelosi and Democrats. Her attacks on police and small businesses has resulted in record high unemployment and skyrocketing crime rates in the District.
The voters are tired and desperate for someone to replace her, but AOC's $4.6 million war chest has silenced all opposition. Help us break through AOC's wall of cash by rushing over $25, $35, $45 or more right now.
RUSH OVER $25 >>
RUSH OVER $35 >>
RUSH OVER $45 >>
RUSH OVER MORE >>
We have just 100 days left! AOC's only competitive because of her army of socialist megadonors. If we can nullify her cash advantage, we'll win.
DONATE NOW and deliver a fatal blow to the Socialist Darling's campaign.
Sincerely,
John Cummings

443,"Dear Alex,
We always hear that socialists have the best intentions. Unfortunately, those intentions are paving the path to hell here in New York. The most recent example is so-called bail reform.
The new law makes it almost impossible for judges to require suspects arrested for non-felony crimes pay cash bail for their release. As a result, anyone who is charged with a misdemeanor or a nonviolent felony is automatically released without having to post bail.
Are you kidding me?
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Corez cheered the passage of the law, and has suggested that other states follow New York's lead. She's even talked about bringing it to the federal level!
The only problem is this ""reform"" has already driven up crime dramatically.
I was on Fox and Friends this week, to share some stats that come from my police precinct, in my district - District 14 - for the week ending February 9th:
Robbery is up 23%
Burglary is up 33%
Felony assault is up 47%
Grand Larceny Auto is up 225%
These policies are endangering our families, and making our neighborhoods and schools unsafe. If you want to help me defeat this weak on crime socialist, please donate $30, $45, or $60 to our campaign right now.
I will not stand for this. I won't let AOC turn New York City into a crime infested skid row. Proposals like bail reform are threatening everything that Mayor Giuliani worked for a decade to accomplish.
New York City was a dangerous place before his tough on crime policies saved our city. During his tenure, the police force was increased by 35 percent, and officers had the support of both the government and the people.
As a former cop, I know that hiring more officers isn't enough. They need to be able to do their jobs, and under Giuliani they were. Misdemeanor arrests increased by 70 percent compared to the previous decade, and violent crime dropped by 56 percent in the city by the time he left office.
Republicans like Rudy Giuliani saved New York City from decades of Democrat mismanagement, and the time has come for us to do it again.
I'm running to defeat AOC, and ensure that she doesn't have the chance to take bail reform to the federal level. Help me put an end to this insanity with a quick $50, $85, or $120 donation right now.
It won't be long before AOC and Bernie Sanders are campaigning for bail reform in your state. She's already been talking up the policy during her stump speeches in Iowa and New Hampshire, and there are dozens more states to go during the Democratic primary season.
If she's re-elected this November, and the Democrats hold onto control of the House, they could very well impose this same bail reform scheme nationwide.
We have to stop that from happening, and stopping AOC from winning a second term is a major step towards killing this dangerous proposal.
Your gift of $150 or more to our campaign will give us the financial support we need to fight her through November, and win on election day.
Together we can take back this district for the hardworking families of The Bronx and Queens who deserve a tough on crime approach from their Congressperson.

446,"Dear Alex,
There was some tragic news this past weekend here in the Bronx. Two NYPD officers were shot while sitting in their patrol car in an assassination style attack.
I'm praying for their quick recovery, and for their families, and I hope that you will join me.
Unfortunately, these horrible attacks are merely the latest in a series of anti-police violence. The left has been demonizing our law enforcement officers for years now, and this is the result of that endless propaganda.
Attacks like these prove that there needs to be a dramatic change in the way that New York City politicians act towards cops. And it has to start at the top.
Mayor Bill de Blasio has repeatedly undermined the hardworking officers of the NYPD and allied himself with leftist extremists. The radicals he's siding with are demanding police officers stop carrying guns, and stop patrolling crime ridden neighborhoods!
You and I both know that is no way to protect New York families.
The Sergeant's Benefit Association, a major New York City police organization, has had enough of Mayor Bill de Blasio's attitude towards police. They tweeted the following after the recent attacks:
This tweet is proof that liberal New York City politicians have failed our police officers. The left has created the violent atmosphere that lead to these attacks, and that must be ended before anyone else gets hurt.
Our police officers need support at the federal level too, and they will have it unreservedly when I am elected to Congress.
As a former NYPD officer myself, backing the blue will be a top priority for me in Congress after I defeat AOC this November.
Our police officers need to know that the politicians who represent them have their backs, and I will. I served as a police officer here in the Bronx, and with New York City's Harbor Unit.
That service taught me what our cops need to do their jobs - they need to know the public respects and supports them.
If you support our police officers, and want another ally of law enforcement in Congress, please join our campaign to defeat AOC right now. I need real Americans like you to fight against the radical socialists donating millions to her campaign.
With your help, we can put an end to this anti-police propaganda, and restore honest representation to the people of the 14th District who deserve change.
Thank you for your support.

Hi ,
I couldn't believe my ears when I heard AOC attempt to explain why New York City is facing the most violent crime wave in twenty years.
She claimed that we're having the bloodiest summer in decades because people ""need to shoplift some bread or go hungry that night.”
You've got to be kidding me!
Murders are up 23%. The number of shooting victims is up 70%. This is a direct result of Mayor Bill de Blasio suspending anti-crime NYPD units and AOC taking the side of gang members, rioters, and looters.
Join our campaign to defeat this deranged socialist today with a quick $25 donation today. I need your help to save New York City from AOC.
DONATE NOW
It is clear from the crimes being committed that these are not crimes of desperation. It is not the poor, who have been forced into unemployment by government mandated lockdowns, who are driving this crisis.
On July 4th weekend alone there were ten people shot and killed in the city. One was a man shot in a drive-by while walking his 6-year-old daughter across the street!
These are gang-related and drug-related crimes!
Anyone should be able to see that, and should be able to admit it, without having to cover for their political leanings. But not AOC!
She has proven herself incapable of putting politics aside to do what's best for our district. Siding with criminals who want less police, instead of hardworking families who want more police, is the last straw.
Voters in the district are ready to show AOC the door, but I need your help to continue reaching them. Help me continue our campaign's momentum by sending a fast $40 donation right now.
The New York City Council just voted to take $1 billion out of the NYPD's budget and AOC is supporting the move. She's upset it hasn't been cut more!
The families and neighbors I know in the district don't support making their schools and neighborhoods less safe by removing police officers. We need more officers now more than ever!
I've talked to lifelong Democrats who are ready to vote for me, and vote Republican for the first time, because of AOC's anti-cop positions.
As a former NYPD officer myself, voters of all political persuasions are looking to me to stop this socialist nightmare from destroying our city.
Our campaign has never been closer to defeating AOC this November, but I need your help to keep capitalizing on this moment. Your generous gift of $60, $85, $110 or more right now will go directly towards helping me make AOC a one-term Congresswoman.
I'm counting on Americans like you, who support our police and stand for our flag, to help me defeat this delusional socialist. I need you to become a member of our grassroots army today.

View in browser
Dear Alex,
When I entered this race last year I was running because my students told me that I would make a good Congressperson. They respected my knowledge of the Constitution and our country's history, and thought that our district deserved a Representative who would govern based on those principles.
I hoped and dreamed that our campaign would one day rise to the level of an official endorsement from the local Republican parties that I have always respected. And that day has finally come.
The Bronx Republican Party and Queens Republican Party have officially endorsed my campaign to defeat AOC this November!
It has never been more clear that our campaign is the choice for Republicans in the 14th District. We have already won the endorsements from the Bronx Conservative Party, Queens Conservative Party, and the New York State Conservative Party.
Conservatives and Republicans from across the district are united behind our campaign, and with their support, we can take the fight to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and win.
But we need help from conservatives like you as well. We need the financial support of Republicans from across the country to counter the millions of dollars that AOC's army of socialists has already donated.
Join our campaign to defeat socialism right now with a quick $35 donation.
The so-called bail reform that AOC is supporting has resulted in thousands of people arrested for crimes being released onto our streets without being required to pay cash bail. This policy is endangering the families who call The Bronx and Queens home.
The people of the 14th District were already upset with AOC for kicking Amazon out of Queens and costing them tens of thousands of high paying jobs. She has repeatedly thrown salt on that wound and refused to admit she was wrong.
These actions have made AOC more unpopular than ever before here in the district. My friends and neighbors are ready to make her a one-term Congresswoman.
But she still has millions of liberals on Twitter from San Francisco to Seattle who are donating to her campaign. All of the Hollywood celebrities who trash our President are donating millions more. She's going to try and buy reelection, and we need your help to stop her.
You can help stop this from happening with a gift of $60, $85, $110 or more right now. Our campaign relies on the support of real Americans like you.
Everything that AOC has done over the past year has diminished her support here in the district. She may be popular with Bernie Sanders socialists on social media, but she doesn't represent the honest families that I live and work with.
It is quickly becoming a close race, but we still have a lot of ground to cover before November. We need convince voters of all stripes, from independents to moderate Democrats, that it's time to try something new and vote Republican.
As a former NYPD officer and high school civics teacher who has lived and worked here my entire life, I have that cross-party appeal. We can win those voters over, but first we need to reach them with our message.
Help me reach those voters with a $90 donation to our campaign today. Your contribution will go directly towards defeating AOC this November.

# Andrew Romanoff for Colorado
Progress toward LGBTQ
equality “is a jagged line.”
We’re not there yet.
When I first ran for the Colorado House 20 years ago, Vermont had just passed a law allowing same-sex couples to form civil unions. At a candidate debate, the Republican Party planted a question in the audience—hoping to expose my “radical” views.
“Do you support civil unions?” a man asked.
“I’d go further,” I replied. “Gay and lesbian Americans deserve full equality, including the right to marry.”
I won that election—and three more—without ever compromising my commitment to this cause.
As speaker of the House, I helped pass laws to strengthen protections against hate crimes; extend legal rights to same-sex couples; and ban discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. I’m proud to have earned One Colorado’s recognition in this race as a pro-equality champion.
But it’s clear how much work we still need to do. In the House I once led, Republicans tried again this week to reverse our progress—pushing a slate of anti-LGBTQ proposals.
None of these hateful bills will survive the state legislature. But their proponents have an ally in Washington.
Cory Gardner has voted against LGBTQ rights at nearly every turn. I know—in part because I served with him.
As a state representative, Gardner opposed allowing gay and lesbian couples to adopt children. As a senator, he’s racked up scores of 12 and 16 percent from the Human Rights Campaign.
Colorado has shed its label as the Hate State. It’s time to shed Cory Gardner too.

Workplace Discrimination
Dear Friend,
Today, the Supreme Court delivered a landmark win for equality and justice in our country. In a 6-3 decision, the Court ruled that gender identity and sexual orientation are protected from workplace discrimination under Title VII of the Civil RIghts Act of 1964. Discrimination against LGBTQ persons, however, continues and is a goal of the current Administration and its supporters in Congress, including Jackie Walorski.
The decision highlights what is at stake in November. Jackie Walorski is virulently anti-LGBTQ. Pat Hackett will be the first openly LGBTQ member of Congress from Indiana and believes in Dignity and Justice for All. Unlike Jackie, Pat understands that discrimination is not a Hoosier or American value.
In 2016, Jackie offered her full support to the Russell Amendment, a horrific piece of legislation that made government funding of discrimination against LGBTQ persons under the guise of religious liberty perfectly legal. Jackie’s view was extreme and out of step with the bipartisan main. Jackie also opposed marriage equality and hate crime legislation that includes LGBTQ protections. She continues to oppose the Equality Act.
Jackie is out of step with the goodness of the people of this District. She is harmful to LGBTQ families and proud in her support of the Pence/Trump Administration. Can you invest in our campaign to send Pat Hackett to Washington as our Representative and advocate for Dignity and Justice for All?

Hunter Biden’s Russia Collusion 😲
The Senate Committee on Homeland Security, revealed that Hunter Biden received a $3.5 million wire transfer from a Russian billionaire in 2014. This was during his father’s time as Vice President. Sadly, this is barely being covered by the mainstream media because it does not fit their anti-Trump narrative. Joe Biden needs to answer for Hunter’s crimes, but obviously the mainstream media will not pursue the topic.

Joe Biden's Job Killing Tax Increase Plan 💸
Wednesday, I joined Charles Payne on Fox Business to discuss Joe Biden’s plan to raise taxes in just about every facet of our lives. Biden made bogus claims that he will bring manufacturing jobs back to the US.
In reality, President Obama and Vice-President Biden permanently destroyed one million manufacturing jobs during their administration. President Trump then fostered an economic boom that added over half a million manufacturing jobs in his first three years.
City Council That Approved Abolishing Police:
""Where Are the Police?"" 😳
I wish I could say this headline was satire. Sadly, it's not. Months ago I predicted that efforts to defund law enforcement by the left would result in high levels of crime. Especially in neighborhoods that need protection the most. That is exactly what residents in NYC, Seattle, Chicago, and Minneapolis are now experiencing.
Police and local law enforcement need more funding and more support to do their jobs, not less. I hope these liberal Democrat politicians recognize the fatal errors in their radical policies. Alas, I am not holding my breath.

Welcome to our weekly newsletter: A 90-second overview of what I've been up to in Congress, coupled with an insight into the latest conservative news.
After Yates’ Testimony, Comey Must Be Questioned ❗
Sally Yates’ bombshell testimony in last week’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing made one thing clear: Former FBI Director James Comey must testify to Congress.
A mountain of new evidence was revealed, including Deputy Attorney General Yate’s disapproval of Comey's actions. Americans need to hear from Comey directly about his plot to set up former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The FISA warrant abuses which were used spy on the Trump Campaign must also be questioned.
* Watch this: Rep. Reschenthaler says Senate must hear from James Comey after Yates testimony (Fox News)
Last week on the Daily Briefing with Dana Perino 📺
On Wednesday I joined Dana Perino on Fox News to discuss who Joe Biden will pick as a running mate. With speculation rising, I told Dana that it doesn’t matter who Joe Biden picks - Donald Trump will be winning re-election in November.
NY AG Attacks the NRA 🚫
New York’s Attorney General, Letitia James filed a lawsuit against the National Rifle Association (NRA) last week, with the intent to dissolve the organization.
Her attempts to take down the association which protects our second amendment rights, is a political attempt to appease the far left. New York City crime is skyrocketing but, James would rather play politics than protect her constituents.

455,"Friends,
Members of the far-left continue to spread disorder and lawlessness. Not only do they refuse to condemn rioting and vandalism, they encourage it:
Representative Ilhan Omar thinks troublemakers are “angelic.” I disagree.
I need your help to restore law and order to our streets.
Yes, I Will Donate to Restore Order
We are lucky to live in a country where free speech is welcomed, and we should not take that for granted. We need to use our voices to bring about change - not violence.
Unfortunately, radical voices are promoting violence and I need your help to fight back.
The squad just introduced a bill that would:
❌ Prevent police officers from doing their jobs.
❌ Make it impossible to recruit qualified officers.
❌ Increase crime rates through the roof.
Can you help me stop this bill and stand up to the radical liberals in Congress?
Yes, I Will Donate to Restore Order
In liberty,

456,"No one is above the law – no one, not even the president.
Gary Peters for U.S. Senate
Friend, my loyalty has always been with the people of Michigan and our country.
That’s why I swore to be an impartial juror and to defend our Constitution – so when facts presented over the last few weeks showed that the president put his personal and political interests ahead of our nation, I voted to remove him from office.
Here’s what it came down to for me: No one is above the law – no one, not even the president.
But it didn’t take long for Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump to set their sights on me for my vote – and now, Senate Republicans have announced they will stop at nothing to defeat me.
I’m not scared of them. I’ve been in tough fights before, and I won’t be intimidated. But the unfortunate truth is that Trump and McConnell are flooding Michigan with millions of dollars to try and ensure that I lose my race.
The good news: Democrats have a real shot at taking back the Senate this year. But if we lose here in Michigan, we also lose any chance to regain control. That means we’ll see at least two more years of a Republican Senate covering up Trump’s crimes.
I don’t have the same network of far-right billionaires and special interests that McConnell and Trump can dispatch at will. But I have grassroots supporters like you, friend.
We set a goal to raise $10,000 to prepare for the onslaught of attacks the GOP has promised are coming our way – unfortunately, we fell a bit short.
Now we’re hoping to close the gap. It would mean the world if you could chip in $3 before midnight – here’s your secure link: [[URL REDACTED]]

Senator David Perdue is corrupt, and a Trump puppet.
He doesn’t represent my state’s values.
We need a SURGE of grassroots support to replace him in November.
Here’s the bottom line: If we fail to hit our fundraising goal this month, we'll be off track for the rest of the campaign and risk control of the Senate.

Brynne Kennedy for Congress
Alex --
Back in 2003, Tom McClintock led a recall campaign to nullify the 2002 election of California’s Democratic Governor -- over a policy disagreement.
Earlier this week on Fox News (and yesterday on the House floor), McClintock said that we shouldn’t hold a President of his own party accountable for potential crimes against the constitution, because of the outcome of the 2016 election.
Huh? This is what blind partisanship looks like. And it’s why we need to retire Tom McClintock from Congress.
McClintock cares more about party than doing what’s right. And that’s why we must defeat him in 2020. Will you chip in to help?

I’m running for Congress to put our country and community first. That means reaching across the aisle to get things done. It means working with a President of either party when they are right -- and doing the right thing when the President or party bosses are wrong.
But that’s not how Tom McClintock rolls:
* He shut down our government and devastated the CA-04 economies that depend on our national parks in a partisan effort to eliminate healthcare for people with pre-existing conditions.
* He voted for a tax bill that literally took money out of the pockets of families, small businesses, and even wildfire victims in our community in order to give it to wealthy special interests out of state.
* Last week alone, he voted against bipartisan measures to support CA-04 farmers and save local families thousands of dollars in prescription drug costs because his party bosses and special interest funders told him to.
Please chip in to help me defeat McClintock and send someone who will put country over party to Congress.
Last night, the House of Representatives performed its duty to uphold our Constitution. Now that duty moves to the Senate.
The President deserves a fair trial and the American people deserve the full truth. Leaders Schumer and McConnell must work together to ensure a fair process in the Senate, and a jury that is focused on facts and free of partisan interference. And I hope the President will participate and tell his side of the story.
As important as this work is, there is so much more that also needs to be done to make life better for all Americans. But it is clear that Tom McClintock has no interest in anything beyond blind partisanship.
Our community deserves better, and that’s what this campaign is all about. Thanks for standing with us.

Tom O'Halleran for Congress
25 years ago, the United States signed into law the Violence Against Women Act. Since then, this watershed legislation has been foundational in our efforts to investigate, prosecute and eliminate violent crimes committed against women.
But last February, Congress failed to reauthorize the bill. I fought back then and I am continuing to fight back now because this is a massive blow to the safety of women and girls across our country and it must be corrected.
Inaction is just unacceptable. Add your name to this petition and tell Congress we need to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act now!
SIGN HERE
Protecting women from violence is not and should never be a partisan issue. Our job as representatives is to fight for everyone’s best interests, including women and girls.
I will proudly fight for reauthorization of this critical bill in Congress. It’s simple to me, but for others, they need to hear the urgency in our calls to action. That’s why I need your help.
Join your voice with mine to call on Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Every day we sit on our hands, we put another person’s life in danger. We cannot let this inaction go on any longer!
Thank you for making your voice heard,

Jill Dickman for Nevada State Assembly District 31
Cites Jill’s Business Savvy and Anti Sanctuary City Platform
Las Vegas, NV/September 24, 2020 - Today the Law Enforcement Loyalty PAC announces that it is endorsing Jill Dickman for Nevada State Assembly, District 31, in the November 3, 2020 election. Sam Peters, founder of the Law Enforcement Loyalty PAC, cited Jill’s belief in protecting Nevadan’s 2nd Amendment rights and her pledge to vote against Sanctuary City type laws. The Law Enforcement Loyalty PAC process of selecting candidates included a formal comprehensive survey, an interview, and research into the candidate’s past. Based on these elements, the Law Enforcement Loyalty PAC Board of Directors voted unanimously to endorse Jill Dickman for Nevada State Assembly. The board concluded Jill’s experience as a former Assemblywoman and her dedication to keep fighting for the safety of her community is exactly what Nevada needs in Carson City.
“The Law Enforcement Loyalty PAC is proud to endorse Jill Dickman for election to the Nevada State Assembly, District 31,” said Sam Peters, founder of the Law Enforcement Loyalty PAC. “Jill served in this Assembly seat previously and brings a conservative voice that will help Nevada protect it’s rights and keep it safe for our future. Jill will fight against progressive’s trying to take away firearms and make Nevada a sanctuary for illegal immigrants. Jill will always stand by her law and order beliefs.
“She has done it before, and she’ll fight for Nevadan’s again. The Law Enforcement Loyalty PAC pledges its support to Jill Dickman, as she’s pledged her support to Nevadan’s.” continued Peters.
The Law Enforcement Loyalty PAC is raising money to support pro-law enforcement candidates, incumbents, and ballot measures while targeting for removal those elected officials that do not support the rule of law. As progressive and weak politicians acquiesce in the onslaught of far-left ideology, crime rates have soared with innocent citizens and law enforcement officers the victims. Peters believes the men and women in blue deserve elected representation that supports them.

Dear Friend,
Yesterday, Nevada's leftist / progressive State Legislature continued the war on YOUR police officers.
Senate Bill 2 was passed by the State Senate on Monday, and on Tuesday the Super-Majority Democrat Assembly followed suit. There was nothing the Republican Caucus could do to stop the out-for-blood Democrats.
Now, it's headed to the Governor's desk with nearly ZERO chance of Veto.
This anti-police legislation threatens our public safety. The result will be massive retirements of officers, because they don’t want to face constant lawsuits or non-stop investigations based on feelings instead of evidence.
The men and women of blue put their lives on the line to keep us safe. They don’t know if they're coming home at the end of the shift. Now, the liberals in legislature wants them investigated even when there is no evidence of a crime.
Criminals are going to be treated better than our officers. This is wrong!
When officers start retiring early or just quitting, who will respond to your 911 call? The answer is - NO ONE!
Learn More
As a father and a former member of military law enforcement, I want to put Nevada’s public safety back on track. That’s why I formed the Law Enforcement Loyalty PAC. We're going to help elect representatives who will stand with the police, not the criminals.
Right now, we're interviewing candidates to ensure that they are on the right side of this issue. When ""Back the Blue"" candidates are selected for endorsement, we'll help their campaigns get out their public safety message through signage, advertising on social media, and mailing voters.
We are also going to educate voters on how dangerously liberal incumbent representatives have voted.
They need to be held accountable for their vote.
Are you with me?
To launch our candidates to win, we need to immediately raise $6850. Will you help by chipping in $1000, $500, $250, $100, $50, or $35 today?
DONATE TODAY
Your support is crucial to restoring public safety in Nevada. Like you, I don’t want Las Vegas to become Chicago. We can avoid it and stay safe but, we need new elected officials in Carson City to overturn this hurried special session's disastrous Senate Bill 2.
We can do this. Please help!
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Maj. (Ret) Sam Peters
Founder, Law Enforcement Loyalty PAC
Former Candidate for Congress (NV4)
Iraq/Afghanistan Veteran, Bronze Star Recipient
P.S. In these trying times, I hate asking. But, as a former Law Enforcement Officer myself, I know the value of having the support of those I'm serving. Please let me count on you with a donation of $1000, $500, $250, $100, $50, $35 or any amount you feel compelled to give. The Thin Blue Line thanks you!

473,"Alex,
The murder of George Floyd started with three words: “forgery in progress.”
You may know the story that brought us here. Mr. Floyd went to a grocery store and paid with a $20 bill — but the currency was no good. The shop owner called the police. And like so many times before, the officers who responded took a Black man’s life.
For a $20 crime.
This may go without saying, but I will say it: if I had paid with that bill, I would be alive today. My body would not have been on a Minneapolis street. No officer would have pushed their knee into my neck.
If a white man from a privileged background pays with a fake $20 bill? 99 times out of 100, it would be dismissed as “a mistake.”
The moment we are in is historic — massive nationwide protests to demand an end to racist police killings. During a health pandemic that has taken over 100,000 lives. During an economic crisis. Under a dictatorial and vindictive president.
Yet I am struck by this incident in another way — as a father.
Because I have a counterfeit $20 bill in my possession right now, given to me by my daughter.
How did she get it? Well, she’s eight years old, and a Girl Scout. Like countless girls across the nation, she was busy selling cookies this Spring. Learning economics and team-building and communication skills and more.
And one day, someone bought several boxes of cookies and gave her a fake $20 bill.
We didn’t realize it until later. If you haven’t sold Girl Scout cookies before — the parents buy cookies in advance, and then pay ourselves back as we make sales. Weeks ago, my wife went to deposit the money we collected, and happened to notice this bill. It didn’t feel right. On closer inspection, even though much of the design is the same, you can see words that are different. It says “Motion Picture Use Purposes.”
So we wrote it off as a loss. And I had the bill on my desk when I learned how George Floyd was killed.
You may know this: my daughter is Black. Her mother is Nigerian-American. Living in Texas—let’s be honest, living in the United States—she is perceived differently than I was at her age.
And maybe at 8-years old, a shop owner wouldn’t perceive her as a threat if she tried to buy candy or Pokémon cards with this counterfeit bill. Maybe.
But what if she was a little older? 10 years old? 12 years old? At what point does your life become expendable in this country, by virtue of the color of your skin?
It shouldn’t be this way. Racism may be the “original sin” of the United States, as some have said, but it does not have to be our destiny.
That is why we are in the streets. That is why in every state in the Union, in towns big and small, people young and old are marching for justice.
And to demand that Black Lives Matter.
As a candidate for Congress, my pledge is to fight for major criminal justice reforms. Several leading members of Congress, including Congresswomen Ayanna Pressley and Barbara Lee, have put forward essential bills that will create accountability for local police. A database of police abuse; ending qualified immunity for officers who violate constitutional rights; stopping the transfer of military equipment to local police; and investing in Black and other over-policed communities, to lay the foundation for transformative change.
I will certainly fight for these reforms. In the Texas 10th, we have our own history of racist policing. Sandra Bland died in police custody in Waller County, after a racist and unconstitutional arrest. Rodney Reed has been on Texas Death Row for decades — for a crime likely committed by a white former police officer.
There are countless reasons to demand change at every level of government, right now.
And one of those reasons is for the future. To protect our children as they grow up in this society. To ensure that their lives will be treated as sacred. To make certain that Black Lives Matter.
Fighting for you,
Mike Siegel

# Racial Justice
Dear friends,
Paterson is a monument to machine politics in America. While the good times roll for politicians, entire communities have been destroyed by corruption. Incomes are dropping, apartheid schools are increasing, and infrastructure is crumbling for the ordinary residents of Paterson. The model of championing certain parts of a beleaguered rust belt city and abandoning the rest is simply racial segregation by another name. Not surprisingly, Paterson is one of the most violent cities in the country. During a federal investigation, Paterson police officers admitted to dealing drugs, robbing and beating citizens, and illegally stopping and searching drivers. Paterson is a city in turmoil.
Jameek Lowery
On January 5, 2019, Jameek Lowery (1) walked into a Paterson police station, (2) live streamed a video in which he repeatedly asked police officers for water and to not kill him, (3) entered an ambulance where police officers used physical force and compliance holds to secure him, and (4) arrived at the hospital in an unresponsive state with severe facial injuries. Jameek Lowery died in the hospital within two days. When peaceful protestors gathered outside Paterson City Hall for days to demand answers, Paterson police used mace and arrested the leaders of the protests. Regardless of the cause of death in this case, walking into a police station should not be the last conscious act of any person in America.
Criminal justice reform
Police violence against unarmed minorities led to the deaths of countless men and women around the country. Black men are sentenced to 19% more jail time for committing the exact same crime as white men, and black Americans are jailed at more than five times the rate of whites. We have more people in jail than any other country on earth. We need real criminal justice reform both for our district and for America.
We will bring about major police department reform. We will reform civil asset forfeitures. We will end the war on drugs, and replace jail with treatment for minor drug offenses. We will abolish the death penalty and end all mandatory minimums. We will eliminate private prisons and detention centers, which are financially incentivized to hold as many people for as long as possible.
Thank you

Alex,
Today, House Democrats did the unthinkable… After weeks of hearings that have failed to bring a single fact to light, they have abandoned due process and made it official:
President Donald J. Trump is now just the third president in U.S. history to be impeached by the House of Representatives.
Regardless of your own personal opinion on our president, what the Democrats just did tears at the fabric of our democracy.
Our constitution reserves impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors… things that require facts to prove… not just a personal dislike.
We can’t stand by idly as Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff use impeachment as a weapon to undo the results of the 2016 election! I’m asking you to join me in rejecting the misguided impeachment process that Democrats are pursuing… something our current representative FAILED to do.
STOP IMPEACHMENT
STOP THE RADICAL LEFT
Alex, this is bigger than any one of us.
This is even bigger than President Trump.
This is about the future of our democracy, and the preservation of our Constitution. I need you to join me in sending a message to Nancy Pelosi and the radical Democrats in Congress: the American people DO NOT support this unjust impeachment: Join me here!
Time’s running short. We need to send this message quickly!

We shared a mutual friend — my close friend from high school, her close friend from Cornell. Like most relationships, it started with a moment. Our moment happened to be when I saw a picture of Becky hanging in our friend’s hallway.
After some convincing, our friend introduced us. We exchanged emails first, under the guise of advice about graduate school.
We decided to get coffee, and what was supposed to be a brief meeting turned into brunch.
Everything changed after that day. She was no longer a friend of a friend. She was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.
She is my forever valentine.
Becky made the decision to reach out to me, and I am glad she did, and you all will be happy that she decided to run for Congress.
She is fed up with the inaction of Congress on critical issues impacting our children, our parents, and our grandparents, such as gun violence, climate change, and health care.
I need your help to get her there. Will you chip in $14 this Valentine’s Day to help me show Becky that we are all ready to have her in Congress?
DONATE TO MY VALENTINE
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
Ben

Team,
Last week our country saw one of its lowest moments in recent history: Donald Trump was acquitted of all crimes by the United States Senate. Several Republicans even admitted that Trump’s action was shameful and wrong. However, all but one Republican fell in line behind Donald Trump and voted to acquit.
The acquittal had nothing to do with the evidence or the case presented by Representative Adam Schiff and the other House impeachment managers. Instead, it was based entirely on party loyalty.
For his dedication and relentlessness, we wanted to take a moment to thank Rep. Schiff for his role in fighting to uphold our constitution!
Thank you Rep. Schiff - Sign the Card
Donald Trump abused his office and put his own personal interests above those of our country. He should have been removed from office, as demonstrated by Rep. Schiff and the House impeachment managers.
Sign our thank you card to thank Rep. Schiff for his courage during the impeachment trial.
SIGN THE CARD

480,"Dear Alex,
It’s that time of every election year when I receive many questions about the litany of measures on the November ballot and what they all mean.
Below you will find out how I'm thinking about these very important issues.
This is a pivotal election for our state and country. I encourage you all to make your voices heard!
Sincerely,
Senator Brian W. Jones

Senator Brian Jones 2020 Proposition Voter Guide
Prop 14 - $5.5 Billion Bond for Stem Cell Research
I am opposed. State taxpayers' funds were meant only as a one time start-up investment, not as an ongoing funding source. There's also been controversy over potential mismanagement of past funds. Vote NO.
Prop 15 – The so-called “Split Roll” Tax Measure
I am opposed. Raising taxes on small businesses, particularly during a time when the state’s economy is doing poorly and we are facing unprecedented job losses amid business shutdowns? Are you kidding me?!
I am also concerned that this proposition will undermine the letter and spirit of Proposition 13’s prohibition on drastic property tax hikes, and I stand with leaders of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, the California Taxpayers Association, the California Restaurant Association, the California Farm Bureau and the California NAACP in opposition to this measure. Vote NO.
Prop 16 – Enacting Affirmative Action in California
I am opposed and voted against the legislative measure – Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 – that put this proposition on the ballot.
This proposition would remove the following language from the State Constitution: “The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group, on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.”
I do not want to see our state enact racial quotas in hiring, contracting, and school admissions. If approved, that's where this measure ultimately leads us. Vote NO.
Prop 17 – Allows Parolees the Right to Vote
I am opposed and voted against the legislative measure – Assembly Constitutional Amendment 6 – that put this proposition on the ballot.
After a parolee has actually completed the terms of their parole and their other rights have been restored is also when they should be allowed to vote again.
I stand with Crime Victims United and the California Election Integrity Project in opposition to this measure. Vote NO.
Prop 18 – Allows 17 year-olds the right to vote in Primary or Special Elections
I am opposed and voted against the legislative measure – Assembly Concurrent Amendment 4 – that put this proposition on the ballot.
We have a long history of requiring that citizens be 18 years of age or older to vote and I see no reason to change it. Vote NO.
Prop 19 – Changes Tax Transfer Laws for Inherited Properties and Disaster-damaged Properties
I am opposed and voted against the legislative measure – Assembly Constitutional Amendment 11 – that put this proposition on the ballot.
While I support lowering taxes on properties damaged in disasters, this measure was rushed onto the ballot without a thorough review of all the costs and benefits.
I join the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association in opposition to this measure. Vote NO.
Prop 20 – Increases Crime Penalties and Expands DNA Collection from Criminals
I support this clean-up of AB 109, Prop 47 & Prop 57 which all drastically reduced penalties for a number of violent and non-violent crimes and, predictably, led to increases in certain types of crimes.
Additionally, I believe that DNA collection from criminals in custody should be increased to help resolve recent and cold-case crimes.
I proudly stand with the Crime Victims Action Alliance, Crime Victims United and the California Police Chiefs Association in support of this measure. Vote YES.
Prop 21 – Rent Control
I am opposed to this proposition and believe rent control will decrease the availability of affordable housing and will increase the costs to build new housing.
I join with leaders of the California Taxpayers Association, the NAACP, Senior Advocates League, AMVETS, and the American Legion in opposing this measure. Vote NO.
Prop 22 – Exempts App-based Drivers from AB 5
I support this exemption from AB 5 for ride-share drivers (such as those working for Uber, Lyft, Doordash, Instacart, etc.) so they can continue working as independent contractors.
Additionally, I believe that AB 5 ought to be completely repealed and all industries that currently operate as independent contractors should be allowed to continue that freedom and flexibility. Vote YES.
Prop 23 – Dialysis Clinic Regulations
I am opposed and believe the voters have already spoken on this issue by rejecting a similar proposition recently.
Dialysis facilities in California are rightly renowned as the safest in the world. That's why dialysis patients and leaders of the California Medical Association and American Nurses Association also oppose this measure. Vote NO.
Prop 24 – Consumer Data Privacy
I am opposed to this complicated, complex, and un-vetted measure.
Creating a large new state bureaucracy, giving them power to impose penalties, and removing the ability for companies to cure any violations is unwise and the last thing we should be doing in this economic environment. Vote NO.
Prop 25 – Elimination of the Cash-bail System
I am opposed to eliminating the system allowing the judge to require that persons arrested for serious crimes post bail to guarantee they return to court for trial.
It is my belief that the alternative to bail outlined in this proposition will compromise public safety and undermine the justice system. Vote NO.

482,"President Trump suggests supporters illegally vote twice to test mail-in vs in-person
Yeah… you read that right, Alex. Trump just told his own constituents to commit voter fraud.
To reiterate: illegally commit voter fraud.
This is just embarrassing. On top of who-knows-how-many crimes he’s committed of his own, he’s now asking voters to follow his lead.
As if. Join us and commit to voting Donald Trump out of the White House:

Here’s what we already knew: Lindsey is one of the president’s most loyal lackeys in the Senate. After getting EMBARRASSED by Trump during their presidential runs, he turned into Trump’s loudest, proudest supporter in the Senate.
But it doesn’t end there… in his confirmation hearing to rush Amy Coney Barrett onto the Supreme Court, he referred to the “good old days of segregation.”
Lindsey Graham is unfit to represent South Carolina.
Jaime Harrison is on a mission to send Lindsey packing, and right now the polls have never been closer. Will you chip in a split donation between Jaime and Eric so that we can defeat Lindsey Graham?

Lindsey knows his seat is vulnerable this year. That’s why last month he was literally BEGGING for donations on Fox News. And yesterday, he commited a crime in plain sight by asking for donations from the Capitol!!!
But we have a message for Lindsey — No matter how many times you beg for GOP super PACs to swoop in and save the day, you won’t be able to stop the grassroots movement Jaime Harrison has created in South Carolina.
The polling between Jaime Harrison and Lindsey Graham is neck-and-neck. Will you split a donation between Jaime’s and Eric’s campaign to help us defeat Lindsey and flip the Senate blue?

Donald Trump is nothing if not consistent when it comes to serving the United States of America.
When our country needed him to serve in the Vietnam War, HE LIED to dodge the draft.
When our country needed him to protect us from COVID-19, HE LIED and more than 200,000 Americans have died.
And now we’ve just learned that when our country needed him to pay his fair share of taxes, HE LIED to get out of paying them.
Donald Trump is a liar. He’s been stealing from the American people for decades, doing the crime on your dime. He thinks he’s clever, and can avoid ever having to pay for his crimes and devious accounting.
I need your help to show Trump he’s dead wrong.
Ballots are dropping in many states any day now, and we NEED to make these latest revelations hurt Donald Trump where it matters most — at the ballot box.
My team did the math, and right now we need to raise $4,389 before midnight if we want this news to cut through the noise and reach voters in critical swing states across the country.
Can I count on you to chip in $5 or $25 right now before midnight tonight to help us reach that goal? Time is running out, FAST.

489,"I needed housing, healthcare, and access to education.
Friends,
I served 6 years in the Marine Corps as a Field Radio
Operator.
I was drafted into the military because my family and I needed
financial security. I needed housing, healthcare, and access to
education. I was ready to sacrifice my life for all of it.
For every one of those years I served, I
wondered what Memorial Day represented.
What kind of sacrifices were made? At whose
expense? At what cost? What are we
benefiting from millions of lives being lost
and trillions of dollars spent?
I learned I was just another disposable poor person being
manufactured into the military industrial complex— signing
my life away at 18 years old, not knowing if we would come
home alive. I didn’t have a chance to grow up and live yet. The
only people in our country that benefited at all from the sacrifices
and wars, raging for the last two decades were politicians and
corporations. Companies like Raytheon and Lockheed Martin
make the majority of their revenues from selling arms to the US
Government. They profited off of wars created on lies in Iraq
and Afghanistan. We lost thousands of service members at
their expense and millions of innocent civilians throughout the
world from US imperialism.
The lessons I learned from serving inspired me to be a fierce
advocate for oppressed people around the world and try to put
an end to these unjust wars. We should not be shipping off
poor people into profiteering wars so that they could have
access to basic needs. We deserve better opportunities than
this. Families should not have to worry about losing loved ones.
Instead of investing in trillions of dollars for wars, we can
prioritize Medicare for All, Free Public College Tuition, and a
Federal Homes Guarantee.
Help me be a voice for peace in Congress.

If you've stored your info with ActBlue Express, we'll process your contribution instantly:
As a member of Congress, I'll commit to ending global military
interventions, withdrawing military bases, and repealing the
Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), and
reasserting check and balancing powers back to Congress. No
president should have sole power of making decisions over
military matters when so many lives are at stake. People like
George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and Henry Kissenger should be
charged with war crimes and human rights violations.
It is not corrupt politicians and war profiteering companies who
are fighting these wars. It is people like us who are fighting
for them. I am tired of pretending that everything is okay. I’m
tired of celebrating and remembering the lives lost, to war
profiteering, on Memorial Day. Maybe if we all stopped
pretending, then we can finally stop the slaughter.

Hola Familia,
Tonight’s debate will demonstrate what New Yorkers have known for decades: Donald Trump is a disgrace to our city and our country. He built on his father’s ill-gotten fortunes through racial discrimination in housing. He built his public profile by slandering the Central Park Five. He ran on a racist platform, his administration has committed unspeakable crimes against immigrants, and he has given away trillions of public dollars in tax cuts to the wealthy elite like himself. All while he did nothing as 200,000 lives were lost to a preventable pandemic.
Vice-President Biden can and should win and dispense with Trump’s reign, but that’s only a part of the problem. By any measure, Trump has been an abject failure and he should lose the election. But we don’t live in the world as it should be, we live in the world as it is. In 2021, New York must elect a Mayor who will fight for our city, not only against Trump if he succeeds, not just against the white-supremacist movement he inspires, but also against the root-causes of oppression that set the conditions for his political emergence.
As your Mayor, I will fight for every New Yorker against racist and xenophobic attacks, and I will work to destroy the structures of racism, miosgyny and economic injustice that flow through our systems of government. Right now, the city gets far less than what we send to Washington, and as Mayor, I will make sure they step up. I will fight for a People’s Bailout in the wake of the pandemic, more funding for our schools, more resources for NYCHA and housing for all.
And I will leverage the city’s power against ICE until that inexcusable agency is abolished from existence.
Together, we are building a politics for all people, and I need your support to do it.
And follow me on Twitter as I live tweet my reactions to the debates: @dianne4nyc

Hi it’s Tom Cotton, Senator for Arkansas. I’m reaching out today about Dr. Roger Marshall, our Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Kansas.
Dr. Marshall is a pro-life physician who’s delivered more than 5,000 babies. He’s a fellow veteran who’s tough on crime and will work to END our dependence on China.
Chuck Schumer and the radical left have made Dr. Marshall one of their TOP targets this year. In fact, liberal donors have flooded Kansas with $10 MILLION to prop up Dr. Marshall’s opponent — a pro-abortion, pro-amnesty, and pro-Green New Deal radical Democrat.

Dear Alex,
Nebraska Stonewall Democrats have announced their support of our campaign!
The Stonewall Democrats are the largest coalition of LGBTQ and allied Democrats in the country, and they fight every day for equal rights and dignity for all people.
I am so proud to have their support, and it’s an honor I take seriously. So I want to share an overview of my plans to advocate for the LGBTQ community in Congress:
* I will co-sponsor the Equality Act, a comprehensive piece of legislation that bans workplace, housing, and education discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.
* I will fight for the Safe Schools Improvement Act and Family Violence and Prevention Services Act, which make sure that schools are safe places for all students, and that homes are safe places for all members of the family.
* I will address the epidemic of violence against LGBTQ people, particularly transgender women of color, by requiring all hate crimes to be reported to the FBI and implementing anti-bias training for police and public officials.
As a state senator, I made it my mission to create workplace protections for LGBTQ Nebraskans.
Now, I’m taking my mission to Washington, D.C.

Exciting news from (virtual) campaign HQ!
Today our campaign was endorsed today by the Nebraska Stonewall Democrats!
I have always stood up for equal rights.
And I will stand up for equal rights in Washington.
If you are ready for a Congresswoman who will stand up for ALL Nebraskans, consider chipping in today.
Chip-in now >>
And, if you're interested, here's my plan to improve equal rights when I get to Washington:
As a Member of Congress, I will advocate for the best interests of young LGBTQ+ people in both Legislation and in advocacy to administrative agencies. I would add my name as a co-sponsor to the Equality Act.
I will support the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in educational settings, including development of safe spaces for LGBTQ+ students, genders and sexualities alliance networks, provision of mental health services to LGBTQ+ students, and professional development and training for school staff about the needs of LGBTQ+ students.  I will also support the Safe Schools Improvement Act which amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to protect every student from bullying and harassment in K-12 schools.
I will continue to advocate for the Affordable Care Act’s nondiscrimination protections - all people deserve access to quality, affordable health care. I will also advocate for a comprehensive HIV/AIDS strategy, including increasing funding for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program. I will advocate for mental health parity and improve access to mental health care for LGBTQ+ people, especially in schools and rural communities.
Young LGBTQ+ people, like everyone else, deserve fair treatment in the workplace. I made workplace protections legislation my personal priority bill in the Legislature in 2016 and will continue this commitment to equality as a Member of Congress.
I will advocate for LGBTQ+ veterans, including supporting additional training and supportive services under the Supportive Services for Veterans Families program to address fair and competent provision of family support services and health care.
I do not think that health care providers should be able to turn away LGBTQ+ and HIV+ people. I have worked on this issue as a part of the Nebraska Association of Social Workers, advocating that everyone deserves services and referrals. I will continue to do so as a Member of Congress.
I will address the epidemic of violence against LGBTQ+ people, particularly trans women of color, in the following ways:
A reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act should include additional protections for LGBTQ+ people and additional funding for specific programs to serve trans women of color. I also support strengthening nondiscrimination protections in the Family Violence and Prevention Services Act. I will advocate to make permanent the National LGBTQ+ Institute on Intimate Partner Violence.
I support requiring all hate crimes to be reported to the FBI to better understand, track, and prevent violence against LGBTQ+ people. I will also support stronger law enforcement policies to provide additional training to officers to prevent bias and mistreatment and increase community trust.
I'm ready to fight for all Nebraskans in Washington. I've fought for all Nebraskans from day 1 in the Nebraska Legislature.
If you are ready for a Congresswoman who will stand up for ALL Nebraskans, consider chipping in today.
We can't do this without you,

Dear Alex,
In the last few days, I've reached out to people in my community and I've done a lot of listening.
I've listened to the heartache of George Floyd's family and community and I share it.
I've listened to the heartache of James Scurlock's family and community and I share it.
I've listened to young people who have reached out to me, who were involved in peaceful rallies for racial justice and equality, and want their message to be heard.
I've listened to law enforcement officials navigating the balance between keeping people safe and responding humanely to the pain of racism and injustice.
I've listened to business owners while helping to clean up, and I know they are both concerned about their property and concerned about the people in our community.
I've listened to community leaders on phone calls with my friends and leaders in the minority community, working to help, understand, support, and learn.
We have a lot of work to do to confront uncomfortable truths and find a shared way forward.
One contribution I will make towards our shared progress towards more justice and equality is LB 1069, a bill I introduced in the Nebraska Legislature to create a collaborative research center for best practices in preventing violence and expand strategies to intervene in and prevent violence of all kinds. This bill was supported by health care experts, mothers of crime victims, and law enforcement. When we return to session, I'll work tirelessly to pass LB 1069.
I'll continue to listen, and I want to hear from you.
In peace and community,

Kate Bolz for Congress
Dear Alex,
As a state senator, I made it my mission to create workplace protections for LGBTQ Nebraskans. Now, I’m taking my mission to Washington, D.C.
Alex, I am proud to have the support of the Nebraska Stonewall Democrats!
Nebraska Stonewall Democrats endorse Kate Bolz
The Stonewall Democrats are the largest coalition of LGBTQ and allied Democrats in the country. They fight every day for equal rights and dignity for all people.
I'm proud to have their support, and it’s an honor I take seriously. So I want to share an overview of my plans to advocate for the LGBTQ community in Congress:
* I will co-sponsor the Equality Act, a comprehensive piece of legislation that bans workplace, housing, and education discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.
* I will fight for the Safe Schools Improvement Act and Family Violence and Prevention Services Act, which make sure that schools are safe places for all students, and that homes are safe places for all members of the family.
* I will address the epidemic of violence against LGBTQ people, particularly transgender women of color, by requiring all hate crimes to be reported to the FBI and implementing anti-bias training for police and public officials.
Alex, we are quickly coming up on Election Day, and it will take all of us to elect a real LGBTQ advocate for Nebraska. I don’t want to scare you, but Alex – it all comes down to this.
Will you chip in $20.20 to stand with the Stonewall Democrats before time runs out?

501,"Team,
This week we saw a historic decision from the Supreme Court that determined people cannot be fired for their gender identity or sexual orientation — a landmark in the continued journey for equality and something we all here at #TeamGood are celebrating! But make no mistake, the fight continues every day.
Our Suncoast community is home to thousands of LGBTQ+ constituents, and while this week brought a huge and historic victory in the Supreme Court, just days before on the anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub shooting, the Trump administration rolled back health care protections for the transgender community.
But it’s not just the Trump administration that turns its back on LGBTQ+ Americans.
Vern Buchanan has stood with Trump and voted time and again against protecting LGBTQ+ Americans. He voted against the bipartisan Equality Act, which would prohibit discrimination against LGBTQ+ people and would have prevented the Trump Administration from rolling back healthcare protections for transgender Americans.
If you’ve had enough of Vern Buchanan, stand with Margaret Good. If you believe that LGBTQ+ Floridians deserve a representative who won't fall silent in the face of the bigotry and who will stand up for their rights, now is the time to take action.
Buchanan voted time and again against the bipartisan Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expands federal hate crime protections to LGBTQ+ individuals and makes it easier for the federal government to prosecute hate crimes based on race, religion, or national origin.
Vern Buchanan has turned his back on the LGBTQ+ community. He refuses to protect our friends, family, and neighbors from discrimination and hate.
If you know it is time for change, add your name to the thousands of reasonable people who are calling for Vern’s retirement.
This is our time.

502,"Today is a sad day.
The House of Representatives has introduced two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, alleging he has committed high crimes and misdemeanors in his dealings with the Ukrainian government.
No matter your political affiliation, we can all agree that when politicians are accused of widespread corruption, it’s America that loses.
Time and again, we hope that our elected officials will act in good faith with the interests of the American people at heart. But given President Trump’s behavior, it’s clear that his actions were never made in the good faith we deserve.
That’s why it’s important that our system is resilient, and that good men and women are ready to stand tall when wrongdoing occurs. We started this campaign because we believe that President Trump is unfit for office, and that America deserves better.
As more of his criminal activity comes to light, we’ll continue forward in the belief that we can restore America’s position as the shining city on a hill.
Support our movement right now with a contribution of $20.20, $50, $100, or whatever you can today and help us step into the role that President Trump’s unethical conduct requires him to vacate.

Friend,
With all the uncertainty in the world, now is the time for our community to come together.
That is why I am outraged by recent reports of hate crimes against the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. From racial epithets to violent crimes, members of our community have endured discrimination that is never acceptable.
Let’s be clear: describing coronavirus as the “China virus”, “Chinese virus”, and “Wuhan virus”, is xenophobic and racist.
It is also unacceptable that the federal government has no plans to combat the rise in AAPI bias and hate crimes. During the SARS outbreak, and after 9/11, federal agencies made a concentrated effort to prevent targeted incidences of hate against minorities, but so far they have failed to address this growing problem during this public health crisis.
In response to this, over 50 local groups have come together to stand against this hate. I am proud to stand with them, and I’d like to use my platform to share their message. Click here to read their letter and then sign on to their letter of support.
Together, we must always stand against hate in all its forms.
In solidarity,
Sara

Friend,
There’s a lot of misinformation going around about coronavirus (also known as COVID-19), so I wanted to use this space to share a few facts in the hopes of dispelling any myths you may have heard. Here are the facts:
1. Even if you don’t have symptoms, you can still be contagious
Many people test positive for COVID-19 but don’t show any symptoms. It is highly contagious and spreads quickly, which is why social distancing and shelter in place orders are so important.
2. There are no current treatments or at-home remedies that can treat COVID-19
While the FDA is rapidly testing potential therapies to treat COVID-19, there is no drug or at-home remedy that is effective or safe. If you or a loved one starts showing symptoms, you should contact your health care provider, but only go to the emergency room if you experience life-threatening symptoms such as difficulty breathing
3. It’s not just seniors who are at risk. Young people can become infected with COVID-19
We now know that COVID-19 isn’t just dangerous for the elderly. Younger people who were otherwise healthy have contracted severe cases of COVID-19 that require hospitalization, and have even resulted in death.
4. It is not a “Chinese virus,” as President Trump has called it
COVID-19 is part of a family called Coronaviruses that does not originate from any specific geographic location or ethnicity. Calling it the “Chinese virus” or any other variation is xenophobic, divisive, and is leading to a rise in hate crimes and harassment against the Asian-American community. We’re all in this together.
For more facts, visit the World Health Organization’s page on advice for the public.

Friend,
Our country is not living up to its ideals. The killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and others have rightfully caused a national uproar. Black lives matter — and we are not doing enough to protect them.
Fixing the institutionalized racism in our country will take many different steps, but here’s one action we can take now: we must make lynching a federal hate crime.
ADD YOUR NAME
Throughout history, and still now, thousands of Black Americans have been lynched and yet Congress has not made these racial killings a federal hate crime. This should not be controversial in 2020.
The House and Senate have both passed versions of anti-lynching bills in recent years, but one Kentucky Senator is holding up the bill. Enough is enough. Sign your name if you agree that lynching should be a federal hate crime.
In 1892, Ida B. Wells wrote that “the strong arm of the law must be brought to bear upon lynchers in severe punishment, but this cannot and will not be done unless a healthy public sentiment demands and sustains such action.” 128 years later, these words are still true — and it’s on us to show Congress what we, the public, demand.
TELL CONGRESS TO MAKE LYNCHING A HATE CRIME
Our reckoning with our national history of racism is far from over, but this crucial step is long overdue. Tell Congress: we must make lynching a federal hate crime.
Thank you,
Team SJ

506,"Today, the U.S. House of Representatives upheld their Constitutional oath and voted to impeach Donald Trump.
Friend,
Today, the U.S. House of Representatives upheld their Constitutional oath and voted to impeach Donald Trump.
I am grateful to those Members of Congress who voted to put their country over politics. I know that this decision weighed on each of the Members, just as the somber reality of impeaching a United States President is weighing on millions of Americans. It is not the easy decision or the politically expedient decision, but the right one.
There is no ambiguity here: the evidence conclusively shows that Donald Trump committed high crimes and misdemeanors, and that the threshold for impeachment has been met. At the State Department and at the United Nations, I saw how corrupt politicians across the globe undermined their countries’ democracies for personal and political gain. That’s why I know that it is critical for the health of our democracy and our standing in the world that we send a clear message that no one – not even the President – is above the law.
It is with solemnity and clarity that I support the President’s impeachment.
The House did their job, and now it’s time for the Senate to do theirs – to hold a fair trial and, ultimately, to remove Donald Trump from office. Sign your name if you believe the same.
SIGN YOUR NAME
Last week, Mitch McConnell announced that he will be “coordinating with the White House” as the Senate takes over impeachment proceedings. But we can’t give up hope. We need to stand together and say with one voice that the majority of Americans support and believe in our Constitution. Stand with me today and demand the Senate uphold their Constitutional oath and remove Donald Trump from office.
SIGN YOUR NAME
In solidarity,

507,"Dr. Tarter for US Senate
Friend,
Our government’s primary function is to keep Americans safe!
I have witnessed firsthand the devastation caused by illegal immigration. I did my medical training at the County Hospital of Los Angeles, one of the best public hospitals in the country. It’s located in a crime-ridden area heavily populated by illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrant gang members, drug dealers, and criminals create chaos and plague their communities.
We absolutely need to stop illegal immigration by building the wall and giving Border Patrol the resources they need. We need local law enforcement to cooperate with ICE and deport illegal immigrants with criminal records. For those who want to come to this country, I strongly support them entering America legally through the front door.
I stand ready to be a strong voice and leader for making our neighborhoods and communities safer, by strengthening our borders and ports of entry, and combating the deadly opioid crisis. Your support in my campaign for US Senate will help advance our values, and I would be forever grateful for any assistance you can provide during the final push!

508,"At minimum, we need to #DefundThePolice
Andom, Democrat for Congress | NY-16
Hi There,
Yesterday marked one week since I was arrested at a large protest against police brutality in the Bronx’s Mott Haven neighborhood. Hundreds of my peers were trapped by police officers and physically unable to leave before NYC’s 8 PM curfew. Police violence against the protesters was severe: bodies were thrown onto the ground by officers wearing riot gear; police bicycles were used as ramming weapons; and pepper spray was shot into protesters’ faces. The NYPD arrested hundreds of us for “breaking [a] curfew” that was broken because of their presence. It was my first time being arrested – I didn’t think the night would end the way it did – and I ended up being detained for over 19 hours without food or a phone call and transported to two other boroughs (Queens and Brooklyn). The police department lied to my family about my location when they called trying to find me.
The murder of George Floyd has been the impetus for much of the protests, as millions have taken to the streets around the world in solidarity for Black Lives Matter. After more videos detailing police brutality surfaced, calls to defund the police followed. Divesting money from local and state police budgets and reinvesting it into communities, mental health services, and social service programs has always been part of my platform. What it means to “defund the police” is to be clear about, and with exact budgetary stipulations, how we can address needs and conflict without the threat of psychological/physical harm and/or incarceration. We need to change our entire approach instead of throwing the same reforms at the wall over and over. For this reason, I’m supporting the call to defund the New York Police Department. The NYPD has a $6 billion annual budget, and a minimum of $1 billion of that budget needs to go to social services to benefit, not hurt, us. NYC already has a shortfall of $9 billion due to COVID-19 for the budget currently in process. We cannot ideologically or financially support the militarization of the NYPD. We cannot pay for riot suits and war technology that harm us while teachers are paying for school supplies out of their own pockets, children are still hungry, and other important services continue to be cut.
We need to diminish the political power of policing. It’s happening already: the Minneapolis City Council has committed to dismantling their police department and starting over. The poverty-stricken city of Camden, New Jersey did the same in 2013, and it resulted in less crime, less police brutality, and a city on the rise. Spending more money for police reforms hasn’t worked. We need to #DefundNYPD.
If you want to know more about defunding the police, click here.
Please be safe and, also, please keep protesting. WE are at a point of history in which change is possible. Let’s make it happen.
In solidarity,
Andom

McSally for Senate
Hi Friend. It’s Senator Tom Cotton. My friend Martha McSally and I both served in combat, so we’re used to a fight. And we are used to smears from the left. But when I saw what they’re doing to Martha now, I realized they’ve reached a new low.
Over the weekend, Democrats and their friends in the mainstream media had a full-on meltdown. They’re pretending to be outraged over a joke from Martha but the truth is they’re attacking her because they want to smear a good conservative who fights.
I wish I could say I was surprised, but this leftist propaganda appears to be the norm for Republicans in battleground states as we get closer to Election Day.
The fact is, Martha McSally is a conservative fighter who is tough on crime, wants to secure the border, and she’s working with me to make China pay.
She’s running against a liberal with close ties to China and the Chinese Communist Party.
And Arizona’s Senate seat is CRITICAL to holding our Senate Majority. Can I count on you to step up today and help Martha fight back against these ridiculous smears coming from the left?
I hope Arizonans and Americans are able to see through this character assassination for what it really is: Another attempt to undermine a conservative leader who is taking on the left.
Will you join me today and STAND with Martha McSally, Friend?

The best thing we can do to fight back is to rush resources now to help Republicans reach voters in this must-win state! >>

Thank you to the small businesses and volunteers who are banding together to create much needed PPE for our frontline workers and community members to make sure they have the protection they need.
Thank you to the amazing teachers (including my wife Amy), and all the educators across Minnesota who have created virtual learning plans to ensure all children continue to learn and grow while staying safe at home.

512,"One thing that Donald Trump has made perfectly clear: that the lives of Black Americans are in terrible danger as long as he remains president.
But the problem runs deeper than one administration's misconduct. It's the systematic and systemic violence against Black Americans, the lack of accountability for each and every crime committed on American soil against our friends and neighbors.
Those who shot Jacob Blake should be held accountable. Just like those who killed George Floyd must be held accountable. And Breonna Taylor. And too many more.
This election is our chance to move things in the right direction, but it can't be about just one night.
It has to be a movement, an effort in each and every state to reform a broken system and rebuild the trust that system has stripped away from generations of Americans who were oppressed.
We must all continue to raise our voices to demand change. My promise to you is I'll keep up the fight in Congress and be on the front lines with our grassroots movement peacefully fighting for change.
I want you there with me. Because it's going to take energy and effort from all of us to right these generational wrongs.

513,"My opponent didn't like that I called her out during our debate last week for promoting QAnon. But she still refuses to denounce this violent ideology that has been labeled a domestic terror threat by Donald Trump's own FBI. As hard it is to wrap my head around the idea that people believe this garbage, what's even more concerning is that some of those people are candidates for federal elected office.
So let's set the record straight: QAnon is a delusional conspiracy theory from the darkest fringes of the internet. QAnon believers hijacked the horrific and very real crime of child sex trafficking and twisted it into a fake conspiracy theory to help Donald Trump. They allege that satan-worshiping pedophiles are secretly plotting against Donald Trump... and that Donald Trump is the one saving the world. The irony is totally lost on them.
A coalition of over 100 nonpartisan organizations dedicated to fighting human trafficking just released an open letter to candidates saying that anybody ""who lends any credibility to QAnon conspiracies related to human trafficking ""actively harms the fight against human trafficking"" and that candidates who do not expressly condemn QAnon and actively debunk the lies ""should be held accountable.""
Don't tell my opponent, though. She refuses to condemn QAnon on her social media. Yet she tries to call herself a ""moderate Republican""? Yeah, I don't think so either.
Decency is on the ballot in just a few days. Will you help me send a strong message that dangerous conspiracy theories have no place here by chipping in ahead of our LAST end-of-month fundraising deadline before Election Day?
Your contribution will help us get-out-the-vote this weekend.
We're almost there.

514,"My opponent? She's really into Donald Trump. Really into Donald Trump.
I'm going to keep this brief, but it's worth mentioning: she runs her Twitter account just like Trump, full of bitterness, hatred, and downright lies.
She rants and raves about ""Democrat ran [sic] cities"" and says Democrats ""hate our country.""
She calls Black Lives Matter a ""marxist terrorist organization"" and supports QAnon – an extremist group that exploits exploited children and hijacked the horrific crime of child sex trafficking by twisting it into a sick conspiracy theory to help Trump.
She defends the officers who shot Breonna Taylor and retweets photos that call RBG an ""opponent of the Constitution."".
And that was all just in the last few weeks.
Here's the bottom line: my opponent wants to be a rubber stamp for Trump's greedy, special-interests first agenda, but she also wants to help Trump spread his racism and lies here in Massachusetts.
Decency is on the ballot this November. Will you help me send a strong message that her bitter, divisive, and dishonest campaign isn't welcome here?
I'm running to be a progressive voice for Central and Western Massachusetts, and I'm asking for your generous grassroots support as we approach this final end-of-quarter fundraising deadline before the election.

Right now, we face diplomatic and military uncertainty in the Middle East.
Senate Republicans and Democrats alike are dissatisfied with the White House briefing they received on Iran.
The House has voted on a war powers resolution.
Today, I'm thinking about these issues through my lens as a cybersecurity professional.
Odds are that a cyber-attack from Iran today would not likely be crippling, but this one-on-one approach is not a realistic assessment of what is at stake in cyber warfare. Attacks never come one at a time. Rather, in every second of every day our government, businesses, schools, medical centers, libraries, and homes receive millions of potential attacks generated from automated programs from nation-states as well as organized crime.
The United States may have cyber strength today, but we must battle much of the world that seeks to bring us down. Rule of security: hit the weakest link. When one country is a target and all that needs to be done is attack the weakest link, those challenges cannot be reduced to one country, one attack.
Cyber is different from conventional warfare. Taking the realities of that world into account leads to this conclusion: The United States must lead in diplomacy as well as in cybersecurity technologies. A first strike policy contradicts that sound strategy, and, ultimately, risks our national security.
If elected, I would be the only person in Congress, Democrat or Republican, with a background in internet policy and cybersecurity. With your help, I want to protect our country, maintain our economic viability, reinforce the integrity of our elections, defend our schools and teach our children how to use the internet safely. But in order to get there, I need your help! Please donate today?

Alex,
The urgency of beating Donald Trump and the GOP this November is growing with each passing day.
Our corrupt president is now working through Attorney General Barr to prevent the Department of Justice from investigating and prosecuting his, his family’s, and his friends’ crimes. He’s retaliating against whistleblowers, firing Inspectors General, fomenting racism, and stoking culture wars. After bungling the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic, he’s making it even worse by undermining testing and lying about the severity of the crisis. And in the midst of a deadly pandemic, he’s asking the Supreme Court to fully repeal the Affordable Care Act which would strip health coverage from millions of vulnerable Americans.
Meanwhile, Trump’s Republican enablers in the House and Senate are so fearful of challenging their unhinged leader that they’ve resigned themselves to just sitting back and watching as our system of laws is dismantled piece by piece and our country plunges further into chaos.
Enough. We have to stop this madness, Alex, and now’s the time to do it. How? By winning big this November — not just in my own congressional election, but in key races all over the country where I’m working to elect great Democratic candidates. I need your help in that effort.
Please donate before the critical end-of-quarter FEC filing deadline this Tuesday. A strong showing this quarter will not only help secure my North Coast congressional seat, it will enable me to devote even more resources to the imperatives of growing our House majority, taking back the Senate, and saying goodbye to Donald Trump forever.
CONTRIBUTE
While news headlines are dominated by Trump’s increasingly lawless and destructive actions, Democrats in Congress are showing what good governing actually looks like. We’re working non-stop to provide oversight and pass legislation that will improve the lives of Americans and make our country stronger and better.
Last week, we introduced the Moving Forward Act, a $1.5 trillion green infrastructure plan designed to rebuild our roads and bridges, improve our transit system, make schools safer, increase affordable housing, expand access to broadband, develop sustainable water supplies, and much more. Most importantly, every aspect of this bill works to protect our environment and address climate change.
If you believe in this kind of legislation and want me to continue fighting for our shared values in Congress, I hope you’ll make a contribution before the June 30 deadline. It’s the only way we can really move forward and put our country back on track.

Dear  Alex,
Election Day is tomorrow and I can't thank you enough for your support. We have run a great campaign and are finishing strong!
I am humbled to have received many endorsements including that of President Trump, law enforcement groups across the state and local Hudson Valley political leaders.
Your time, donations and support are what have given us the momentum to pull ahead in such a competitive seat. Now, I'm asking you for one simple thing - to spread the word to your family and friends to make sure they get to their voting sites tomorrow and vote Republican all the way down and across the ballot.
The polls will be open tomorrow, November 3rd, from 6am to 9pm. To locate your poll site, visit this link.
This is our very last chance to push back against the pro-crime and anti-business policies of my opponent Sean Maloney. Let's not take anything for granted.
Please share this email with a friend to make sure they get out and vote in this critically-important election.
Thank you,
Chele Farley

Facebook Join My List Logo
Dear Alex,
Liberal politicians’ bad decisions are now putting our safety at risk. Last year, law enforcement, district attorneys and community leaders spoke out against the radical policy to enact cashless bail in New York state. They were ignored.
Now our communities are less safe. Almost every day there is another story of a person accused of a serious crime being let out on bail without having to post bond. None is more outrageous than the tragic death of Rosie Osai on Christmas Eve, and the subsequent release of the illegal alien charged with her death.
If we can’t rely on our elected officials to keep us safe, it is time to send them home and elect new leaders who will. My opponent, Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney, is a strong supporter of ending cash bail. You can hear him say so himself in the video below.
Maloney: Ending Cash Bail &quot;Top Priority&quot;
Now that people are being let out into our communities to strike again, where is Sean Maloney? Nowhere to be found. It is time to send him home.
I won’t hide. I will speak out against bad policies. And I will fight to keep our communities safe. Please join me in helping send Sean Maloney home by
donating to my campaign today.

Facebook Join My List Logo
Dear Alex,
Sean Maloney has become a certified member of The Swamp. This shows he’s either out of touch with our Hudson Valley values or no longer cares.
Maloney clearly hasn’t gotten over the fact that his impeachment investigation failed to find a crime. So rather than move on and get to work on solving problems that matter to us, he’s lashing out and blaming any Senator who disagreed with him. But don’t be fooled by Maloney’s motives.
Maloney engaged in the swamp game himself last week:
1) go on a liberal, cable TV show on MSNBC;
2) throw out charges like authoritarianism and attack Republican Senators up for re-election; and
3) turn around and use the video to raise thousands of dollars from the members of The Resistance for your own campaign.
Watch the video of Maloney on Lawrence O’Donnell’s show.
Rep Sean Maloney Can't Let Impeachment Go
Within 24 hours of that appearance, Maloney sent out an email highlighting his hit job to raise money.
Alex, Sean Maloney tries to tell us he’s a centrist. The truth is he’s abandoned us to curry favor with liberal donors across the nation to fund his campaign. I’m running for Congress to represent you. I can’t, nor would I want to, leverage my office to benefit my political needs. So I’m counting on you to help me fight back against Maloney’s swamp tactics by chipping in even $5 now.
Chip in $5
Chip in $10
Chip in $25
Chip in $50
Chip in $100
Chip in $200
Together, we can win this race, end the DC swamp games and restore some order and common sense to Congress.

521,"The radical mob vandalized the Washingtonville World Trade Center Memorial.
Facebook Join My List Logo
Dear Alex,
President George W. Bush stood on the rubble of the Twin Towers and grabbed a bullhorn to speak over the noise of that moment with force and clarity. President Bush’s words rang true that day: “I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.”
As Americans, all of us were united in the fight for freedom, to protect our values and our way of life, to rid the world of terrorism.
It is in the memory of those who died that day that we built monuments to their bravery. They stand as a tribute to the sacrifice and greatness of our unity and our values. Every year on 9/11 we promise to remember and never forget.
We need to remember that, more than ever, because somehow the radical mob thinks it’s now okay to destroy these monuments. While protesting is a fundamental American right, vandalism, violence and lawlessness is never acceptable.
I was heartbroken to learn the news that a band of criminals would damage the Washingtonville World Trade Center Memorial this past week. These thugs must be found and prosecuted for their crimes. In the meantime, I’m inspired by the community members who are stepping up to protect the monument.
The radical left is about destruction with no plan to replace what they destroy with anything better. It is the prevalence of that agenda that motivated me to create my petition [[URL REDACTED]] If we allow them to continue, we run the risk of losing our freedoms, our way of life and our country.
Let’s unite,

Securing the Border from Your Hometown
Published on February 2, 2020
Joe Walz
U.S. House of Representatives Texas CD-22 Candidate
There is no doubt in my mind or in the laws of physics that a wall is an effective method of preventing someone or something from going from point A to point B.
What else do we need to fund? What other programs need reform or abolishment? One of the biggest ways to stop chain migration and remove the proverbial carrot would be to stop birth-right citizenship and maternity tourism. These things subvert the intent of our federal immigration laws and I will fight to stop them.
Technology exists to significantly reduce the burden on our men and women at Customs and Border Patrol. We need to equip the USCBP with these forms of deterrent and detection. That all helps, but what if your Sheriff could start removing illegal immigrants him or herself?
I present to you the Immigration and Customs Enforcement 287g Program. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) 287(g) Program enhances the safety and security of communities by creating partnerships with state and local law enforcement agencies to identify and remove aliens who are amenable to removal from the United States.
Put simply, the 287g program gives a law enforcement agency the equipment and authorizations to interview immigrants, check Department of Homeland Security databases, issue detainers to hold individuals until ICE takes custody, enter information into the ICE case management system, and issue the Notice to Appear – the first steps required for removal.
A Sheriff could literally start the deportation process from within his jail. A proactive Sheriff could even arrange a voluntary removal, to include arranging transportation back to home country for the individual. Sheriff Louderback of Jackson County, Texas has enrolled his county and doubles down by giving presentations on the program to various groups like the one Fort Bend Republican Patriots Club received from him a few years ago. Perhaps that’s why Sheriff Louderback is often seen with President Donald Trump in The White House.
Sheriffs that are opposed to 287g use inflated figures and fictional numbers to make it seem like not enrolling in the program has its merits in fiscal responsibility. These notions could not be further from the truth. The cost of illegal immigrant crimes, societal costs, and the damage done to families victimized by criminal illegal aliens far outweigh the costs presented by soft on immigration Sheriffs.
My county Sheriff briefed his constituents at multiple events that he was not going to participate. He stood by and played a video he produced - instead of telling the people directly what his intent was and why. Look at the examples below, both deported after being detained by a law enforcement office enrolled in 287g.
New Jersey – On May 23, 2019, a Designated Immigration Officer from the Monmouth County, NJ 287(g) Program encountered a citizen of Mexico charged with luring-enticing a child, sex assault victim under 13, lewdness, endangering-sexual conduct with a child. The subject entered the United States on an unknown date and location without inspection. The Monmouth County 287(g) Program placed an immigration detainer, Form I-247A, and warrant on the subject who will be served a Notice to Appear.
South Carolina – On March 13, 2019, a Designated Immigration Officer from the Charleston County, SC Sheriff’s Office 287(g) Program encountered a citizen of Mexico who was charged with criminal sexual conduct with a minor second degree – victim 11 to 14 years of age. The individual had previously been removed. The Charleston County 287(g) Program placed an immigration detainer, Form I-247A, and warrant on the subject who will be served with a Notice of Intent/Decision to Reinstate Prior Order.
The State of Texas tasks elected Sheriffs with the duty to uphold public safety within their county. When every other Republican Sheriff in the vicinity of Fort Bend County is participating, one must ask how is it that these smaller counties with less revenue and less illegal immigrant crime are able to participate. I am not lost as to why the democrat Sheriffs are not participating. That is what makes the GOP known for being tough on illegal immigration. We as a party tend to be more proactive and less sympathetic to the illegal, and more concerned with the welfare of citizens and LEGAL immigrants we serve.
This would serve as a proactive manner of dealing with human trafficking and drug trafficking occurring right here in Fort Bend. If the families only knew that there was a way those things could have been prevented from within our own county’s departments.
No new officers must be hired. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement pays a major portion of the detention cost. Statistics from counties like Gwinnett County, Georgia saw a long-term reduction in average daily jail population directly correlating with their 287g participation. That long-term savings is how you judge whether a program is fiscally sensible or not. Business-minded folks know, sometimes you must spend a little money to make money. 287g fits this model perfectly. For the costs of travel and hotels, a Sheriff could reduce his long-term average jail population. There’s the nugget of gold. Not to mention, the enhancement of public safety in the jurisdiction.
As the Representative for Texas’ 22nd District in 2020 – I will assist our new Sheriff by filling the gap between the cost to house an inmate and what ICE reimburses the jail. Nullifying that excuse could encourage thousands of agencies to participate. Keeping in mind there may be some work for the jails to work to reduce that cost per day figure as well.

I’m deeply disappointed by the inability of the Republican-controlled Senate to be a check on our President’s corrupt actions, especially by their leader Mitch McConnell and his #1 yes-man Steve Daines.
If you’re also disappointed and frustrated with our Senate, donate $20 or even just $3 today to help me flip Montana blue.
As a U.S. military veteran, all the political grandstanding and inaction deeply hurt me and the service I did for this country. I served our democracy in the military, and in just a few short weeks, the Senate may have done irreversible damage to it by covering up the crimes of President Trump.
As a Montanan, I’m sick of being represented by someone who puts what’s better for his party and political future before what’s best for our state. If you agree, donate any amount to my campaign right now.

Alex --
The 56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence were America’s original protesters. Their signature was a crime against one country. But it was also a statement of hope towards a new one.
They were farmers, sharecroppers, inventors and businessmen. Not a one of them was perfect.  Some were even slave owners. But they were the leaders of that day, July 4, 1776. While two rose to the presidency, most suffered greatly for their actions. Five were captured, tortured and killed. Others were left to a life on the run, had their property destroyed and suffered the loss of their loved ones.
Their actions embarked America on a course that was far from certain. But the unity of the mission was written in the document Thomas Jefferson wrote the night before. His words contain the greatest call for freedom among all people.
“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”
Their pursuit of a more perfect union is the march of freedom that has carried Americans from one generation to the next. Each navigating the obstacles of their time. The adversity each faced may have seemed as insurmountable as creating an army of farmers to take down the greatest military power of the time. But each moment’s challenges were met.
The challenges of today are great. But together through protest, unity and understanding, we will overcome them and, in the end, take new steps towards a more perfect union where freedom reigns.
Protest, march, celebrate and pursue your happiness. Happy July 4th.

Alex,
While the Democrats continue to fumble over the Iowa Caucus, tonight President Trump scored yet another touchdown with his State of the Union Address.
The President highlighted achievements made over the last three years and outlined his agenda going forward.
Middle Class, Blue-Collar BOOM!
* Unemployment rate is at a near 50 year low;
* Record stock markets;
* Wages are up;
* Income inequality is down; and
* the USMCA, which is expect to add up to 600,000 jobs and $235 billion to the economy.
Drain the swamp, it's time for Congress to work for us!
* Lower healthcare costs, without compromising standards;
* Hospital cost transparency;
* Reject free government healthcare for illegal aliens;
* School Choice;
* Vocational and trade schools; and
* President Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to ban late term abortion.
A stronger, safer America!
* Since 2016, the violent crime rate in America has fallen nearly 5 percent after rising each of the two years before President Trump took office;
* Protect and defend the Second Amendment;
* The U.S.-Mexico border apprehensions and illegal crossings are down; and
* Terrorist leaders such as Qasem Soleimani and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi are dead.
Tonight, President Trump highlighted his achievements, but made it clear that there is still more work to be done.
Now more than ever, it is time for us to get to work to re-elect President Trump, #TakeBackKS3, and flip the House!
Let's Keep America Great!
God Bless,
Adrienne

# I’ve had enough!
Enough of watching our cities being destroyed. Enough of our small businesses – and even large businesses - being looted. Enough of our country’s heritage being destroyed by angry mobs. Enough of our police being under attack. Enough of anarchists trying to destroy our capitalistic system.
That is why as your next U.S. senator, I will introduce legislation to make these acts of domestic terrorism a federal crime, punishable by a mandatory 10-year prison sentence. We need strong laws on the books to address these crimes and harsh punishments that serve as a deterrent. We cannot as a country sit idly by any longer and let this happen. Especially when so many local officials are either powerless to act or vocally supporting these acts.
We’re seeing far left local officials actually fanning the flames and pushing for these actions. A city council member in Seattle just called for replacing capitalism with socialism. New York’s mayor is focusing on replacing our national heritage while violent crime in his city skyrockets. AOC dismisses a rise in murder as people just trying to find bread. Here in Kansas, Lawrence’s mayor undermined the police chief by reversing his decision to remove people who illegally blocked off a main street with couches and things to stage a sit-in and deface public property.
This legislation is needed and needed now. As your senator I fight for this bill since we need to say enough is enough!

We need leaders who will stand up and say enough is enough!

If and when another president and another Congress face this issue, we must guarantee that the process is impartial and thorough.
Unlike what happened with Donald Trump's trial, the Senate should be a place where the nation's gravest issues like impeachment are vigorously debated and thoughtfully considered — not swept under the rug by a highly-partisan majority desperate to protect someone who has clearly committed a crime. Or perhaps worse, a highly-partisan majority determined to impeach a President by blocking evidence of innocence.

532,"For our democracy to endure, it must have an independent and impartial judicial system—one that puts the rule of law ahead of personal and political considerations.
That's why I am calling on Attorney General William Barr to resign immediately.
Please add your voice to the more than 40,361 Americans that have already called on him to resign.
Demand that Barr resign
Barr claims to be independent from Donald Trump. But, as we saw with his recent interference in the Roger Stone case, the truth is very different.
The facts?
* Roger Stone is guilty, and the career prosecutors on his case recommended a specific sentence for the crimes committed.
* Then, Trump whined publicly (via Twitter, of course) that his friend was being treated unfairly.
* The result? Barr jumped into action, working to secure a lighter sentence for a key Trump ally.
This is absolutely unacceptable. We cannot have the rule of law change at the whim of Trump's Twitter rants.
And that comes after he misled the American people about what was in the Mueller report. He has violated the promise he made during his confirmation hearing to ""keep the enforcement process sacrosanct from political influence.""
Because he clearly is willing to sacrifice the independence of our professional prosecutors in the service of Donald Trump and his allies, he is unfit to serve as Attorney General.
Sign the petition and let's make sure we're heard: William Barr must resign now.

534,"Today, I voted to acquit President Donald Trump on both articles of impeachment in the United States Senate. [[URL REDACTED]]
Dear Alex,
Today, I voted to acquit President Donald Trump on both articles of impeachment in the United States Senate.
First, I am glad the Senate soundly rejected impeachment and did not remove President Trump from office.
The articles of impeachment brought to the Senate from the Democrats in the House of Representatives represent an assault on the presidency itself and the weaponization of impeachment as a political tool.
I also believe that the impeachment effort was driven by a level of partisanship and 'Ends Justify the Means' behavior the American people have rejected.
The proper way to end this matter was a vote to acquit and allow the American people to vote for or against President Trump in November – not to remove him from office and prevent him from running for reelection.
Finally, I have detailed my views below if you want additional information about how I reached my decision on this important vote.
Sincerely,
Lindsey Graham
Lindsey Graham
United States Senator
* * *
THE PROCESS USED IN THE HOUSE TO CONSTRUCT THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT WAS FLAWED:
I feel compelled to condemn the impeachment process used in the House of Representatives because I believe it was devoid of basic, fundamental due process.
This impeachment was completed within 78 days and had a spirit of partisanship and revenge that, if accepted by the Senate, would lead to the weaponization of impeachment against future presidents.
In the House of Representatives:
* President Trump was entirely shut out of the evidence gathering stage in the House Intelligence Committee.
* President Trump was denied the right to counsel, right to cross-examine, and right to call witnesses.
* Much of the evidence gathered against President Trump by the House Intelligence Committee consisted of inadmissible hearsay.
* The House Judiciary Committee Impeachment hearings were, for lack of a better term, a sham.
More importantly, during the Senate trial the House managers admitted the reason they did not seek testimony from President Trump's closest advisers – former National Security Adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney – was because it would have required them to go to court and slowed their effort to impeach President Trump before the presidential election began.
It was a calculated decision to deal the courts out of President Trump's impeachment inquiry due to a political timetable.
With today's Senate vote to acquit President Trump, I hope the Senate has sent a clear message that this should never, ever happen again.
THE CASE AGAINST THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT:
As to the substance of the allegations against President Trump:
The Obstruction of Congress article is literally impeaching the President because he chose to follow the advice of the White House Counsel, the Department of Justice and was willing to use constitutional privileges in a manner consistent with every other president.
This article should be soundly rejected, not only in this case, but also in the future. Whether one likes President Trump or not, he is the president and has privileges attached to his office. To impeach him for exercising those privileges is unprecedented.
The Abuse of Power article of impeachment is beyond vague, does not allege criminal misconduct, and requires the Senate to engage in a subjective analysis of President Trump's motives and actions. It also represents an existential threat to the presidency.
The House managers argued the sole and exclusive purpose of freezing aid to Ukraine was for the private, political benefit of President Trump. It is clear to me that there is ample evidence that the actions of Hunter Biden and Vice President Biden were inappropriate and undercut American foreign policy.
Moreover, there was evidence in the record that officials in Ukraine were actively speaking against candidate Trump and were pulling for former Secretary of State Clinton. Based on the overwhelming amount of evidence of inappropriate behavior by the Bidens and statements by State Department officials about certain Ukrainians' beliefs that one American candidate would be better than the other would, I found it eminently reasonable for the President to be concerned about corruption in Ukraine, election interference, and the behavior of Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter.
It remains hard for me to believe that Vice President Biden was an effective messenger for reform efforts in Ukraine while his son Hunter was receiving $3 million from Burisma, one of Ukraine's most corrupt companies.
It is obvious to me that after the Mueller Report, President Trump viewed the House impeachment inquiry as a gross double standard when it comes to investigations. The House launched an investigation into his phone call with President Zelensky. At the same time, the House showed no interest in the actions of Vice President Biden and Hunter Biden.
The President, in my view, was justified in asking the Ukrainians to look into the circumstances surrounding the firing of Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma, and whether his termination benefited Hunter Biden and Burisma.
It is clear to me that the phone call focused on burden sharing, corruption, and election interference in an appropriate manner. The most vexing question was how President Trump was supposed to deal with these legitimate concerns.
THE HOUSE DOUBLE STANDARD:
The House managers suggest that President Trump could not have asked the Attorney General to investigate these concerns because that would be equivalent to President Trump asking for an investigation of a political rival. However, in the next moment, the House managers declare the proper way for President Trump to deal with those allegations would have been to ask the Attorney General to investigate.
They cannot have it both ways.
I believe that it is fair to criticize President Trump's over-reliance on his private attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate alleged corruption and conflicts of interest regarding the Bidens and Burisma. However, I do not find this to be a remotely impeachable offense and believe it would be beneficial for the country to find other ways to deal with such matters in the future.
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT CASE DOES NOT MEET REMOVAL STANDARD:
Assuming the facts — in the light most favorable to the House managers – that for a period of time the aid was suspended by President Trump to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and election interference, I find both articles fail as impeachable offenses.
I find this to be the case even if we assume additional facts from Mr. Bolton are accurate.
The simple fact is the Ukrainians received the military aid and did not open the requested investigation.
The allegations contained in this impeachment are not what the Founding Fathers had in mind as high crimes or misdemeanors. Our Founding Fathers, in my view, envisioned serious, criminal misconduct that would shake the foundation of the American constitutional system.
The Nixon Impeachment had broad, bipartisan support once the facts were revealed. The Clinton Impeachment started with bipartisan support in the House and ended with bipartisan support in the Senate, even though it fell well short of the two-thirds vote required to remove a president.
I hope my decision to vote not guilty on both articles of impeachment is seen as a rejection of WHAT the House of Representatives did and HOW they did it.
To remove a President from office requires conduct that shakes the very foundation of our constitutional system.
This impeachment effort fell far short of that high standard.

The impeachment charade continues unabated today in the House Judiciary Committee. Chairman Nadler ignores the rules and precedents set over the long history of our country in order to ram fake, unsupported charges against an elected President through this kangaroo court.
At the same time, Congressional Democrats continue to prevent meaningful reform of our immigration system and a physical barrier on our southern border even as American citizens are victimized by crime, drugs, and cheap labor pouring across it.
I came to Washington to fight for our shared values.
It is now obvious that the fight will continue through 2020 and beyond.
So, with prayerful consideration, today I officially filed to run again to be the Representative for the 6th Congressional District of Texas.
Representing you with passion and wisdom is my sacred obligation, and a great honor.
Will you support me as I stand with you by contributing $25, $50, or more to my reelection campaign?
Together we can stop the impeachment charade and take real action at the border.
With so many big issues at stake…USMCA, trade, prescription drugs, taxes, and debt…it is insane for the Democrats to focus on trying to undo an election.
That is why I keep fighting: to support President Trump’s policies and protect his reforms from the radical left that seeks to unmake the progress of the last three years.

Dear Friend,
You’ve probably heard about Shelley Moore Capito’s now-infamous statement that passing “Red Flag” gun confiscation laws “makes good sense” to her.
But did you know that last October, she also co-sponsored another piece of gun control legislation?
Senate Bill 2690, the “Restoring, Enhancing, Strengthening and Promoting Our Nation’s Safety (RESPONSE) Act,” punishes “unlicensed” firearms dealers in order to ensure private gun sales go through a NICS background check, even though states who have implemented universal background checks have a 15% higher per capita rate of mass shooting deaths.
This basically creates a “nationwide task force” designed to spy on and punish law-abiding gun owners who build and sell their own firearms.
Do law-abiding Americans really need their names on another deep-state watch list?
Senator Capito
Furthermore, parts of the bill provide encouragement for social media platforms and users to report individuals they think might pose a threat to themselves or others, making already existing Gun Confiscation (“Red Flag”) laws even more easily abused.
Even when no crime has been committed, this bill allows for putting private citizens on watch lists and taking their lawfully owned property away.
Furthermore, this bill creates a whole new surveillance system for children, increasing the power of government to tell children what they can and can’t do, say, or think.
Individuals on the left and right are concerned about this enhanced government surveillance of children. And there's NO EVIDENCE that this will mitigate the problem of school shootings.
This awful bill is opposed by the National Association for Gun Rights.
And it’s co-sponsored by my opponent and your current Senator.
As a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, I ask you join me in fighting to protect our rights and freedoms.

Dear Friend,
The attack on our gun rights in America has never been more severe.
Just this past week, the Virginia legislature passed a host of anti-2nd Amendment legislation, including a “Red Flag law,” which allows law enforcement to forcibly confiscate your weapons if someone files a complaint claiming that you pose a “threat” to yourself or others.
Allen Whitt with Mayor Joetta Hatfield
In New Mexico, “Red Flag” passed despite the complaints of an overwhelming majority of the state’s sheriffs. In retaliation, the governor included a measure in the bill that leave these sheriffs open to lawsuits if they refuse to comply.
These bills are causing political chaos, and will soon cause increased crime at the local level.
While law enforcement are busy either confiscating law-abiding citizens’ guns or getting sued for not confiscating law-abiding citizens’ guns, criminals will roam more freely, with no police or armed citizens to stop them.
In West Virginia, where we are a pro-gun state, we expect our leaders to stand firm and support our cherished Second Amendment Rights.
However, our senator, Shelley Moore Capito is not standing for up for our rights. She instead is virtue signaling to a liberal press and anti-gun groups that she is sympathetic to their goals by speaking favorably about gun control.
Shelley Moore Capito said that “Red Flag” laws “make sense” to her.
Do they make sense to you?
If not, I hope you’ll take time to learn more about my campaign for U.S. Senate. I will fight for every word of the U.S. Constitution, meaning I will fight to protect your rights from Day 1.
As a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, I ask you join me in fighting to protect our rights and freedoms.

Dear Friend,
The attack on our gun rights in America has never been more severe.
All over the country, radical leftists are passing anti-2nd Amendment legislation, including “Red Flag laws,” which allows law enforcement to forcibly confiscate your weapons if someone files a complaint claiming that you pose a “threat” to yourself or others.
These bills are causing political chaos, and will soon cause increased crime at the local level.
While law enforcement are busy either confiscating law-abiding citizens’ guns or getting sued for not confiscating law-abiding citizens’ guns, criminals will roam more freely, with no police or armed citizens to stop them.

I recently received an A Rating from Gun Owners of America, and a 100% rating from National Association for Gun Rights.
The National Association for Gun Rights has been calling attention to Capito’s liberal record on gun rights. This year, she simply refused to fill out her NAGR Candidate Survey.
In failing to return her survey, Sen. Moore Capito is refusing to pledge her support for your gun rights.
Sen. Capito’s presence in the United States Senate is a threat not only to the Second Amendment rights of West Virginians, but to legal gun-owners all over this great country.
We must replace the liberal Shelley Moore Capito with a conservative West Virginians can trust.
Can you donate $100, $50, $25, or even $10 to send a life-long sportsman to fight for your 2nd Amendment rights in Washington?

Allen Whitt for U.S. Senate
Dear Friend,
Perhaps the most liberal parts of Senator Shelley Moore Capito’s record are her statements and votes on our Second Amendment Rights.
Capito recently pushed for so-called “red flag laws,” laws that violate due process by allowing law enforcement to confiscate privately and legally owned firearms.
Last fall, Shelley More Capito co-sponsored Senate Bill 2690, the “Restoring, Enhancing, Strengthening and Promoting Our Nation’s Safety (RESPONSE) Act.” This bill punishes “unlicensed” firearms dealers in order to ensure private gun sales go through a NICS background check, even though states who have implemented universal background checks have a 15% higher per capita rate of mass shooting deaths.
This basically creates a “nationwide task force” designed to spy on and punish law-abiding gun owners who build and sell their own firearms. Even when no crime has been committed, this bill allows for putting private citizens on watch lists and taking their lawfully owned property away.
This awful bill is opposed by the National Association for Gun Rights. And it’s co-sponsored by my opponent and your current Senator.
In 2018, Shelley Moore Capito was the co-sponsor of another unconstitutional gun control bill: The Fix NICS Act. This Act was opposed by Gun Owners of America, because it would block gun sales to peaceful, law-abiding citizens. The bill especially threatened the due process rights of veterans.
This Act, sponsored by Shelley Moore Capito, undermines the Constitutional rights of veterans and other Americans, and passed in 2018 over the objections of conservative Senators like Mike Lee.
The National Association for Gun Rights has been calling attention to Capito’s liberal record on gun rights. This year, she simply refused to fill out her NAGR Candidate Survey.
In failing to return her survey, Sen. Moore Capito is refusing to pledge her support for your gun rights.
Sen. Capito’s presence in the United States Senate is a threat not only to the Second Amendment rights of West Virginians, but to legal gun-owners all over this great country.
But the President of the National Association for Gun Rights expressed to supporters in a letter on May 8th:
Thankfully, I do have some good news to report.
Republican Allen Whitt, who is also running to represent West Virginia in the U.S. Senate, returned his NAGR Candidate Survey 100% pro-gun.
In doing so, Allen Whitt is pledging to not only oppose gun control, but to fight to pass pro-gun legislation that will expand gun rights.
I recently received an A Rating from Gun Owners of America, and a 100% rating from National Association for Gun Rights.
We need leaders who will stand up for our fundamental rights. That’s why I decided to run against Shelley Moore Capito. She hasn’t stood strong up to protect our freedoms.
I think West Virginians deserve a leader who will stand in the gap for them and their rights.
I will be that leader. I humbly ask for your support in this fight for our freedoms—which needs fighters in Congress, now more than ever.
Let’s build an arsenal for freedom. Can you donate $100, $50, $25, or even $10 to send a life-long sportsman to fight for your 2nd Amendment rights in Washington?

Dear Friend,
The impeachment sham trial is just getting underway and after being denied due process by Nancy Pelosi, the President will finally have a chance to defend himself.
I hope you agree with me that the President’s team of legal experts are correct: These charges are constitutionally invalid because no crime has actually been committed.
The Democrats have no case and this has been a political witch hunt since the beginning. This entire hoax has been a waste of time and taxpayer dollars and Americans are tired of it.
It is more important than ever to take back the majority from Nancy Pelosi and I’m counting on you to help me do it.

Democrats have already said they could try and impeach the President again. They will not stop, they will never accept the votes of millions of American Patriots who made their voices heard that it’s time to drain the swamp in Washington.
With your help we will fight back harder than ever against these radicals, defend our President, and force Washington to get back to work for our families.

Friend --
On Tuesday, Fulton County (GA) District Attorney announced criminal charges for the two police officers involved in the shooting death of Rayshard Brooks, the young black man found sleeping in his car at a Wendy's parking lot in Atlanta.
In protest, their fellow Atlanta police officers called out of their shifts. As a result, more than 65 police calls were ignored or delayed because of the callouts. While there weren't any serious crimes that occurred during their absence, this display of protest by officers continues to demonstrate the current issues with policing in America.
Simply put, this is unacceptable!
The lives of law enforcement officers are changing, and change is difficult. However, these changes are necessary to protect the most vulnerable around us.
This is why it's important to have leaders supporting reforms like the Justice in Policing Act of 2020 being pushed through the House.
Unfortunately, our representative Randy Weber, along with 19 other house republicans, have co-sponsored a resolution opposing all reforms to policing in America.
We are two and a half weeks out from the next FEC deadline, and it's important we send a message to Rep. Weber and the status quo that change is coming to TX-14.
Can I count on your support with a contribution of $50 to ensure our voices are heard in Washington?
I need you,

Despite the fact that Tony Bobulinski, a former business partner of Hunter Biden, dropped a BOMBSHELL only ONE HOUR before we took the stage, the Fake News media REFUSED to question Sleepy Joe about it.
I knew they were going to do everything they could to cover up Joe Biden's CORRUPT family dealings with China, so I'm taking matters into my own hands.
The truth is, Joe Biden is totally and completely compromised. Many witnesses say what his son, Hunter, did is a crime against our Country. This isn't going away, no matter how much Joe ‘the Big Guy' Biden LIES about it.
We can't let this CROOK become the President of the United States, so I'm calling on YOU to step up and help us secure another LANDSLIDE VICTORY on Election Day.

Friend,
Wow.
Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn't get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?).
Next, she ends her pathetic run at President.
Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP.
And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it's obvious that this radical duo is PERFECT for each other but WRONG for America.
They are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working tirelessly to restore LAW AND ORDER.

I grew up in South-Central Los Angeles in the district Maxine is supposed to – but refuses to – represent in Congress.

But to achieve this, I need help from other conservative patriots, like you.

548,"ROGER STONE
Dear Alex,
I have shocking news. It is truly a life or death situation. Let me explain. My family and I are still in shock.
As you know, back in January I was the victim of a political hit-job by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’ Witch Hunt and was convicted on totally fabricated charges of lying to Congress by a vicious Obama appointed Left-wing Judge, a stacked jury of all Trump-hating Democrats and a corrupt Jury Forewoman.
I was essentially prosecuted because I refused under enormous legal and financial pressure to lie and become a witness against the President who I have known for 40 years and who I spoke to on the phone throughout his historic 2016 Campaign. Mueller’s Dirty Cops had the records of all those phone calls and wanted me to lie about what was discussed in order to impeach the President. I refused.
I was convicted in this political lynching and sentence to almost four years in prison plus two years of supervised probation. I immediately filed a notice of appeal based on the blatant misconduct of the Jury Forewoman. That appeal-if I live long enough to see it through- could take over a year and cost $1 million.
Here is the shocking news- Last week the US Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice told us that Attorney General Barr’s directives to the BOP that inmates convicted of non-violent crimes be transferred from prison to home confinement applies to Democrat super-lawyer Michael Avenatti who was convicted of stealing $25 million from his clients and still faces trial on additional charges, Rick Gates the former Trump campaign official who lied in his testimony against me at my trial and Michael Cohen, the former Trump lawyer who was found guilty of criminal fraud and multiple million dollar tax-evasion and then made a deal to testify against the President\- but NOT to Roger Stone. All these anti-Trump criminals have been released to home confinement.
Rather than home confinement, as ABC news reported today, I have been ordered to surrender to a COVID-19 infested prison in Georgia in just nine days. At 67 years old and with a lifelong history of asthma this is a DEATH SENTENCE!
Here is the proof that I am days away from going to this dangerous prison far from my home and family.
Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Georgia in recent weeks The Prison facility in Jessup has several confirmed cases, awaits tests results of 23 more inmates with symptom and has yet to even test some 1400 other inmates. USA Today reported last week that the BOP handling of COVID-19 has been a disaster and that there is evidence that they are misleading the public about how may cases they really have.
I have no choice but to file an EMERGENCY MOTION with the court that includes my medical records and extensive information from my doctor in a last-minute effort to extend my surrender date at least until the coronavirus crisis in our prisons has passed. We have 24 hours to do that.
This is a LIFE AND DEATH situation. It is clear that the Deep State wants to kill me because I refused to turn on the President and to avenge the 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton.
PLEASE GIVE TO THE STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
President Trump himself has said my trial and conviction was a “miscarriage of Justice” that I was treated “very unfairly” and that my trial was “disgraceful”. I have said openly that I am praying for a commutation of my sentence while my appeal plays out, or even a pardon, but I cannot do that until I have exhausted every legal remedy myself. With this legal motion I will have done so.
I have instructed my new appeals lawyers to prepare a motion challenging this dangerous situation to file in court IMMEDIATELY though I am skeptical about getting a fair ruling from this Judge. My health issues are very real as are the dangers of COVID-19. I don’t understand why I should be treated differently than Avenatti, Cohen, Gates and many others.
My personal physician was contacted just before the weekend and he went to the office Saturday to pulled together all of the records, lab tests and studies that show that a person at my age and in my condition will be highly susceptible to Coronavirus.
But I cannot file this emergency motion in court without your help. We literally don’t have a minute to lose.
As of today, I do not have enough in my STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND to fully pay my lawyers for the complicated legal work that is being done to save me from dying in a coronavirus infested hellhole including the possibility of an emergency appeal to the DC Court of Appeals if Judge Amy Berman Jackson denies me a delay- which based on history is likely.
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
Remember this must all happen in the next NINE days! My wife and family are petrified that I will die of COVID-19 before the election and are outraged by this unfair and unequal treatment!
I am trying to calm them down but I must hear from you.
I know you have been supportive in the past, contributing to help fund my legal defense in what turned out to be an outrageous Soviet-style Show trial in DC last January or signing a petition to the President for Clemency. Can I count on you?
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
This entire horrible ordeal where the legal costs have bankrupted me, the Fake News media has smeared me and the stress of fighting the dirty tactics of Robert Mueller’s now thoroughly discredited Witch-hunt has just worn me down. My wife Nydia now suffers from Rheumatoid Arthritis – Brought on by the stress I am convinced. We are struggling to keep a roof over or head and groceries on the table but I no regrets about my decision to refuse to bare false witness against the President in order to ease the contrived legal danger to myself.
It is only the reaffirmation of my Christian faith in God at the recommendation of Rev. Franklin Graham last January that has given me strength and resolve in this fight for my freedom.
The end is near. Whether I live or die will be decided in the next nine days. I would pay for this myself but I literally have nothing. Please send my Stone Defense Fund whatever you can today.
God Bless You,
Roger Stone

Alex,
I'm Joe Collins, the Republican and Navy veteran running for Congress against Maxine Waters. You've probably seen my new ad ""Mansion Maxine"" on social media:
Mansion Maxine
Maxine Waters has ""represented"" Los Angeles for 44 years, but things are so bad here that even she refuses to live in our district.
While Maxine sits in her out-of-district mansion, the rest of us have to live with the crime, violence, drugs, poverty and homelessness that her decades of failed radical policies have created.
I'm running for Congress to undo the mess that Maxine Waters has created, and I need your help to defeat her in just a few weeks.
Will you help me kick Maxine Waters out of Congress and fight for safe streets and a strong economy by chipping in $25, $50, $100 or more now?
HELP JOE DEFEAT MAXINE »
When I turned 18, I joined the U.S. Navy. During my service, I was deployed to a combat zone during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
But while I was away serving my country and fighting in a war, Maxine Waters couldn't even be bothered to fight for our own community. So when I returned home from war, it was our district that looked like a war zone.
Los Angeles deserves better! America deserves better!
I need your help to hold Maxine Waters accountable for her failed soclialist policies, fix the mess she's created in our community, and ensure what has happened in Los Angeles doesn't happen to the rest of our country.
With just weeks left until Election Day, will you chip in $25, $50, $100 or even more to help me defeat Maxine Waters and restore responsible leadership in Congress?

Alex,
Maxine Waters is “overjoyed” that racist Joe Biden picked her buddy Kamala Harris to be his running mate, and we shouldn’t be surprised.
Maxine and Kamala are both radical liberals from California cities – Los Angeles and San Francisco – that their failed socialist and corrupt policies have turned into epicenters for homelessness, poverty, crime, high taxation, and high cost of living.
What they’ve done to LA and SF are exactly what they will do to the rest of America unless we stand up and fight back!
I am the Republican nominee running for Congress to defeat Maxine Waters in November, and I need your continued support to ramp up our campaign in these final months.
Help Joe defeat Maxine →
As a black conservative Navy veteran from South-Central Los Angeles, I have what it takes to finally kick Maxine Waters out of Congress.
I spent 13 years in the United States Navy – including a combat tour during Operation Iraqi Freedom – which taught me the importance of integrity, hard work and service to country ... things Maxine Waters absolutely does not comprehend.
She has completely ignored her crumbling district while spending all her time and energy on viciously attacking President Trump and, lately, aggressively pressuring Biden to pick her buddy Kamala as his running mate.
Radical California liberals like Maxine Waters, Pelosi, Schiff and now Kamala Harris have taken over the Democratic Party, and they're working together to push the same failed policies that have destroyed California, only on a national scale.
Maxine Waters is a ringleader of this new regime, and we need to remove her from Congress now before it’s too late.
We have less than three months until the election, so please chip in $10, $25, $50 or even $100 or more to help us push toward the finish line and defeat radical leftist Maxine Waters.

Alex, Maxine Waters is hiding from me.
As the Republican nominee running against radical leftist Maxine, I publicly challenged her to a debate at the beginning of the month.
Typical of a 40+ year career politician who has done NOTHING to help her crumbing district, she has ignored my challenge.
But while Maxine Waters is hiding from me, she’s sending gangsters and thugs to my events to harass me and my supporters.

Maxine Waters doesn’t care about our community, and she certainly doesn’t care about black lives.
She’s getting rich off of making a career out of viscously attacking President Trump and conservatives like you and me.
Meanwhile, her failed socialist policies have only resulted in more poverty, joblessness, homelessness, crime and violence in our district.
That’s what Maxine Waters has done to my home, and that’s what she’ll do to the rest of the country if we don’t remove her from office – which is why I need your support today.
Maxine Waters needs to face me and her constituents and answer for her failures. I need your help to flush Maxine out of hiding and force her to debate me – then I need your help to defeat her.
For the good of our country, help me hold radical Maxine Waters accountable by making a contribution of $250, $100, $50 or even $25, $10 or another amount today.

BREAKING: Joe Biden picks PHONY Kamala Harris as running mate.
Friend,
Wow.
Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn’t get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?).
Next, she ends her pathetic run at President.
Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP.
And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it’s obvious that this radical duo is PERFECT for each other but WRONG for America.
They are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working tirelessly to restore LAW AND ORDER.
It’s going to be up to Patriots like YOU to save our Nation from that dark fate, Friend. Election Day is right around the corner, and now that we know what we’re up against, I’m going to do something HUGE:

I am used to getting attacked by the mainstream media and the Left. But this is something new.
I’ve been running ads in swing states to make sure voters know that a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for chaos, crime, and open borders. Joe Biden has turned his campaign platform over to Bernie Sanders and Joe would rather hide out in his basement than face the voters.

557,"ROGER STONE
Dear Friend,
I have shocking news. It is truly a life or death situation. Let me explain. My family and I are still in shock.
As you know, back in January I was the victim of a political hit-job by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’ Witch Hunt and was convicted on totally fabricated charges of lying to Congress by a vicious Obama appointed Left-wing Judge, a stacked jury of all Trump-hating Democrats and a corrupt Jury Forewoman.
I was essentially prosecuted because I refused under enormous legal and financial pressure to lie and become a witness against the President who I have known for 40 years and who I spoke to on the phone throughout his historic 2016 Campaign. Mueller’s Dirty Cops had the records of all those phone calls and wanted me to lie about what was discussed in order to impeach the President. I refused.
I was convicted in this political lynching and sentence to almost four years in prison plus two years of supervised probation. I immediately filed a notice of appeal based on the blatant misconduct of the Jury Forewoman. That appeal-if I live long enough to see it through- could take over a year and cost $1 million.
Here is the shocking news- Last week the US Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice told us that Attorney General Barr’s directives to the BOP that inmates convicted of non-violent crimes be transferred from prison to home confinement applies to Democrat super-lawyer Michael Avenatti who was convicted of stealing $25 million from his clients and still faces trial on additional charges, Rick Gates the former Trump campaign official who lied in his testimony against me at my trial and Michael Cohen, the former Trump lawyer who was found guilty of criminal fraud and multiple million dollar tax-evasion and then made a deal to testify against the President\- but NOT to Roger Stone. All these anti-Trump criminals have been released to home confinement.
Rather than home confinement, as ABC news reported today, I have been ordered to surrender to a COVID-19 infested prison in Georgia in just nine days. At 67 years old and with a lifelong history of asthma this is a DEATH SENTENCE!
Here is the proof that I am days away from going to this dangerous prison far from my home and family.
Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Georgia in recent weeks The Prison facility in Jessup has several confirmed cases, awaits tests results of 23 more inmates with symptom and has yet to even test some 1400 other inmates. USA Today reported last week that the BOP handling of COVID-19 has been a disaster and that there is evidence that they are misleading the public about how may cases they really have.
I have no choice but to file an EMERGENCY MOTION with the court that includes my medical records and extensive information from my doctor in a last-minute effort to extend my surrender date at least until the coronavirus crisis in our prisons has passed. We have 24 hours to do that.
This is a LIFE AND DEATH situation. It is clear that the Deep State wants to kill me because I refused to turn on the President and to avenge the 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton.
PLEASE GIVE TO THE STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
President Trump himself has said my trial and conviction was a “miscarriage of Justice” that I was treated “very unfairly” and that my trial was “disgraceful”. I have said openly that I am praying for a commutation of my sentence while my appeal plays out, or even a pardon, but I cannot do that until I have exhausted every legal remedy myself. With this legal motion I will have done so.
I have instructed my new appeals lawyers to prepare a motion challenging this dangerous situation to file in court IMMEDIATELY though I am skeptical about getting a fair ruling from this Judge. My health issues are very real as are the dangers of COVID-19. I don’t understand why I should be treated differently than Avenatti, Cohen, Gates and many others.
My personal physician was contacted just before the weekend and he went to the office Saturday to pulled together all of the records, lab tests and studies that show that a person at my age and in my condition will be highly susceptible to Coronavirus.
But I cannot file this emergency motion in court without your help. We literally don’t have a minute to lose.
As of today, I do not have enough in my STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND to fully pay my lawyers for the complicated legal work that is being done to save me from dying in a coronavirus infested hellhole including the possibility of an emergency appeal to the DC Court of Appeals if Judge Amy Berman Jackson denies me a delay- which based on history is likely.
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
Remember this must all happen in the next NINE days! My wife and family are petrified that I will die of COVID-19 before the election and are outraged by this unfair and unequal treatment!
I am trying to calm them down but I must hear from you.
I know you have been supportive in the past, contributing to help fund my legal defense in what turned out to be an outrageous Soviet-style Show trial in DC last January or signing a petition to the President for Clemency. Can I count on you?
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
This entire horrible ordeal where the legal costs have bankrupted me, the Fake News media has smeared me and the stress of fighting the dirty tactics of Robert Mueller’s now thoroughly discredited Witch-hunt has just worn me down. My wife Nydia now suffers from Rheumatoid Arthritis – Brought on by the stress I am convinced. We are struggling to keep a roof over or head and groceries on the table but I no regrets about my decision to refuse to bare false witness against the President in order to ease the contrived legal danger to myself.
It is only the reaffirmation of my Christian faith in God at the recommendation of Rev. Franklin Graham last January that has given me strength and resolve in this fight for my freedom.
The end is near. Whether I live or die will be decided in the next nine days. I would pay for this myself but I literally have nothing. Please send my Stone Defense Fund whatever you can today.
God Bless You,
Roger Stone

As a black Republican and Navy veteran from the district who has raised over $4 million against her, Maxine Waters can no longer ignore me.
In fact, she's scared of me – that's why she sent four armed agitators to a family-oriented community event sponsored by my campaign this week!
Get Joe's Back!
Defeat Maxine Waters »
Maxine Waters is a thug who relies on hateful rhetoric and threats of violence as tactics to keep her in office rather than actually helping the people she is supposed to represent.
To defeat her once and for all, I need to hold her accountable. I need to force Maxine Waters to debeate me!
But I need to know you have my back. Will you please chip in $35 or more now to help me hold Maxine accountable for her failed and destructive agenda so I can defeat her in November?
Get Joe's Back!
Defeat Maxine Waters »
Maxine's attacks against me are nothing new ... she's been doing this for decades.
She spends all her time trying to impeach President Trump and attacking his supporters and zero time serving her district – which is why California's 43rd is suffering heavily from crime, violence, drugs, joblessness, poverty and homelessness.
What's happened to our district under Maxine's watch is the same thing that will happen to the rest of the country if we let her and her radical allies take control and implement their socialist and lawless agenda.
Maxine Waters MUST be held accountable and forced to explain herself to her consituents, so I am calling her out for a debate and I need you to get my back.
Please help me kick radical, hateful and failed politician Maxine Waters out of Congress by chipping in $35 or more right now.

561,"I am determined to defeat Maxine because I have witnessed firsthand how her radical socialist policies have failed and even destroyed my community. Joe Collins for Congress
Alex,
I’m the Republican nominee taking on Maxine Waters, but as a black man I’m not your typical Republican.
I am determined to defeat Maxine because I have witnessed firsthand how her radical socialist policies have failed and even destroyed my community. I refuse to let her destroy the rest of our country.
HELP JOE DEFEAT MAXINE »
I grew up in South-Central Los Angeles in the district Maxine is supposed to – but refuses to – represent in Congress.
Maxine’s policies are responsible for the poverty, crime and violence that plague our community... they’re responsible for the drive-by shooting that left bullet holes in my family’s windows and sofa when I was young.
After serving my country in the U.S. Navy, which included a combat tour as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, I have decided to serve my community and my country again and rescue us from Maxine Waters.
But to achieve this, I need help from other conservative patriots, like you.
Our campaign has already raised over $3 million to defeat Maxine. Victory is within grasp, but it’s going to take continued effort and support from every corner of the nation to kick her out of office after more than four decades.
Will you support our grassroots campaign with a contribution of $25 or more and help this black conservative Navy veteran defeat radical socialist Maxine Waters?
DEFEAT MAXINE »
Maxine is not only a failure; she is openly hateful toward conservatives like you and me and has dedicated her entire attention to trying to impeach our President rather than serving her constituents.
It’s time for Maxine Waters to go!
Don’t let hateful socialist Maxine Waters go unopposed any longer. Chip in $25 or more now and help me give Maxine the boot!
Thanks,

TRUMP PENCE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
BREAKING: Joe Biden picks PHONY Kamala Harris as running mate.
Friend,
Wow.
Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn't get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?).
Next, she ends her pathetic run at President.
Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP.
And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it's obvious that this radical duo is PERFECT for each other but WRONG for America.
They are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working tirelessly to restore LAW AND ORDER.

Alex,
Recently declassified documents revealed the full scope of the crimes committed by the Obama administration and the Deep State to take down Trump's Presidency. Their barbaric treatment of General Flynn is just the tip of the iceberg.
Democrats and NeverTrump radicals have undermined our Democratic institutions going after President Trump and his supporters. And they’ve been able to get away with it because of their hold on the House Majority.
If they take this seat in November, our goal of taking back the House Majority and stopping the illegal witch hunts is almost impossible. That’s why Nancy Pelosi and NeverTrumpers across the Country are spending millions to defeat me.
If you want these attacks on President Trump and his supporters to stop so he can focus on putting America First, hurry over a donation to stop Nancy Pelosi from stealing this seat.

569,"ROGER STONE
Dear Alex,
I have shocking news. It is truly a life or death situation. Let me explain. My family and I are still in shock.
As you know, back in January I was the victim of a political hit-job by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’ Witch Hunt and was convicted on totally fabricated charges of lying to Congress by a vicious Obama appointed Left-wing Judge, a stacked jury of all Trump-hating Democrats and a corrupt Jury Forewoman.
I was essentially prosecuted because I refused under enormous legal and financial pressure to lie and become a witness against the President who I have known for 40 years and who I spoke to on the phone throughout his historic 2016 Campaign. Mueller’s Dirty Cops had the records of all those phone calls and wanted me to lie about what was discussed in order to impeach the President. I refused.
I was convicted in this political lynching and sentence to almost four years in prison plus two years of supervised probation. I immediately filed a notice of appeal based on the blatant misconduct of the Jury Forewoman. That appeal-if I live long enough to see it through- could take over a year and cost $1 million.
Here is the shocking news- Last week the US Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice told us that Attorney General Barr’s directives to the BOP that inmates convicted of non-violent crimes be transferred from prison to home confinement applies to Democrat super-lawyer Michael Avenatti who was convicted of stealing $25 million from his clients and still faces trial on additional charges, Rick Gates the former Trump campaign official who lied in his testimony against me at my trial and Michael Cohen, the former Trump lawyer who was found guilty of criminal fraud and multiple million dollar tax-evasion and then made a deal to testify against the President\- but NOT to Roger Stone. All these anti-Trump criminals have been released to home confinement.
Rather than home confinement, as ABC news reported today, I have been ordered to surrender to a COVID-19 infested prison in Georgia in just nine days. At 67 years old and with a lifelong history of asthma this is a DEATH SENTENCE!
Here is the proof that I am days away from going to this dangerous prison far from my home and family.
Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Georgia in recent weeks The Prison facility in Jessup has several confirmed cases, awaits tests results of 23 more inmates with symptom and has yet to even test some 1400 other inmates. USA Today reported last week that the BOP handling of COVID-19 has been a disaster and that there is evidence that they are misleading the public about how may cases they really have.
I have no choice but to file an EMERGENCY MOTION with the court that includes my medical records and extensive information from my doctor in a last-minute effort to extend my surrender date at least until the coronavirus crisis in our prisons has passed. We have 24 hours to do that.
This is a LIFE AND DEATH situation. It is clear that the Deep State wants to kill me because I refused to turn on the President and to avenge the 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton.
PLEASE GIVE TO THE STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
President Trump himself has said my trial and conviction was a “miscarriage of Justice” that I was treated “very unfairly” and that my trial was “disgraceful”. I have said openly that I am praying for a commutation of my sentence while my appeal plays out, or even a pardon, but I cannot do that until I have exhausted every legal remedy myself. With this legal motion I will have done so.
I have instructed my new appeals lawyers to prepare a motion challenging this dangerous situation to file in court IMMEDIATELY though I am skeptical about getting a fair ruling from this Judge. My health issues are very real as are the dangers of COVID-19. I don’t understand why I should be treated differently than Avenatti, Cohen, Gates and many others.
My personal physician was contacted just before the weekend and he went to the office Saturday to pulled together all of the records, lab tests and studies that show that a person at my age and in my condition will be highly susceptible to Coronavirus.
But I cannot file this emergency motion in court without your help. We literally don’t have a minute to lose.
As of today, I do not have enough in my STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND to fully pay my lawyers for the complicated legal work that is being done to save me from dying in a coronavirus infested hellhole including the possibility of an emergency appeal to the DC Court of Appeals if Judge Amy Berman Jackson denies me a delay- which based on history is likely.
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
Remember this must all happen in the next NINE days! My wife and family are petrified that I will die of COVID-19 before the election and are outraged by this unfair and unequal treatment!
I am trying to calm them down but I must hear from you.
I know you have been supportive in the past, contributing to help fund my legal defense in what turned out to be an outrageous Soviet-style Show trial in DC last January or signing a petition to the President for Clemency. Can I count on you?
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
This entire horrible ordeal where the legal costs have bankrupted me, the Fake News media has smeared me and the stress of fighting the dirty tactics of Robert Mueller’s now thoroughly discredited Witch-hunt has just worn me down. My wife Nydia now suffers from Rheumatoid Arthritis – Brought on by the stress I am convinced. We are struggling to keep a roof over or head and groceries on the table but I no regrets about my decision to refuse to bare false witness against the President in order to ease the contrived legal danger to myself.
It is only the reaffirmation of my Christian faith in God at the recommendation of Rev. Franklin Graham last January that has given me strength and resolve in this fight for my freedom.
The end is near. Whether I live or die will be decided in the next nine days. I would pay for this myself but I literally have nothing. Please send my Stone Defense Fund whatever you can today.
God Bless You,
Roger Stone
PS -I cannot formally apply for Clemency- either a commutation of sentence or pardon from President Trump, until my legal motions are heard before the trial court and potentially the DC Court of appeals and my legal remedies are exhausted so I need to hear from you today.

571,"From the Desk of Mike Lee
Fellow Conservative:
The Democrats are trying to exploit the coronavirus crisis so they can defeat President Trump and take over the Senate in November.
They want to force their socialist agenda on America with the Green New Deal, open borders, and liberal judges.
That's why I'm writing to ask you to support my friend Senator Steve Daines, a solid conservative from Montana.
Steve Daines \(R-MT\)
Steve is tough on crime, he stands up to China, and he's against illegal immigration. He's being challenged by Governor Steve Bullock who is weak on China, weak on immigration, and weak on human life.
Please join me in supporting Steve Daines.
Senator Chuck Schumer and former President Barack Obama recruited Steve Bullock to run in this race. They know that despite Bullock's shameless attempts to portray himself as a moderate, he's truly a liberal who will help advance their socialist agenda.
Liberals know Governor Bullock...
❌ Vetoed the born-alive bill to protect babies who survive abortion
❌ Called for a ban on semi-automatic weapons
❌ Opposes the border wall
❌ Supports sanctuary cities
❌ Supports the Iran nuclear deal
❌ Supports efforts to impeach President Trump
Conservatives must work together to help Steve Daines win this important U.S. Senate race.
But it won't be easy.
Steve Bullock has massively out-raised Steve Daines with the support of liberals across the country, and now the race is statistically tied!
Democrats know that their path to the Senate Majority runs through Montana and will work very hard to win it.
If Steve Daines loses in Montana, Chuck Schumer will become Senate Majority leader and the liberal mob will have total control.
We can't allow that to happen.
Please make a generous contribution to help my friend Senator Steve Daines today.
Conservatives can win this race if we work together to make sure voters in Montana know the truth.
Thank you for considering this request and for doing so much to help fight for conservative leadership in Washington.
Sincerely,
Mike Lee Signature

Maxine Waters is “overjoyed” that racist Joe Biden picked her buddy Kamala Harris to be his running mate, and we shouldn’t be surprised.
Maxine and Kamala are both radical liberals from California cities – Los Angeles and San Francisco – that their failed socialist and corrupt policies have turned into epicenters for homelessness, poverty, crime, high taxation, and high cost of living.
What they’ve done to LA and SF are exactly what they will do to the rest of America unless we stand up and fight back!
I am the Republican nominee running for Congress to defeat Maxine Waters in November, and I need your continued support to ramp up our campaign in these final months.
Help Joe defeat Maxine →
As a black conservative Navy veteran from South-Central Los Angeles, I have what it takes to finally kick Maxine Waters out of Congress.
I spent 13 years in the United States Navy – including a combat tour during Operation Iraqi Freedom – which taught me the importance of integrity, hard work and service to country ... things Maxine Waters absolutely does not comprehend.
She has completely ignored her crumbling district while spending all her time and energy on viciously attacking President Trump and, lately, aggressively pressuring Biden to pick her buddy Kamala as his running mate.
Radical California liberals like Maxine Waters, Pelosi, Schiff and now Kamala Harris have taken over the Democratic Party, and they're working together to push the same failed policies that have destroyed California, only on a national scale.
Maxine Waters is a ringleader of this new regime, and we need to remove her from Congress now before it’s too late.
We have less than three months until the election, so please chip in $10, $25, $50 or even $100 or more to help us push toward the finish line and defeat radical leftist Maxine Waters.
Help Joe defeat Maxine →

Defeat Maxine Waters
Rather than serving her constituents, Maxine Waters has spent her three decades in Congress pushing a failed agenda that kills jobs and increases crime as well as sowing hatred toward conservatives and President Trump.
This continued recently as she attacked our President once again on Twitter and even stooped so low as to call him a “complete idiot!”

BREAKING: Joe Biden picks PHONY Kamala Harris as running mate.
Friend,
Wow.
Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn’t get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?).
Next, she ends her pathetic run at President.
Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP.
And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it’s obvious that this radical duo is PERFECT for each other but WRONG for America.
They are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working tirelessly to restore LAW AND ORDER.
It’s going to be up to Patriots like YOU to save our Nation from that dark fate, Friend. Election Day is right around the corner, and now that we know what we’re up against, I’m going to do something HUGE:

Alex,
In 15 terms in Congress – 30 YEARS – radical liberal Maxine Waters has accomplished absolutely nothing.
In the time this radical politician has been in office, here’s what I’ve been doing:
* Grew up in South Central L.A.
* Survived a drive by shooting while living in Maxine’s district
* Graduated high school
* Enlisted in the U.S. Navy
* Participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom
* Retired from the military after 13 proud years
And now, I am running for Congress against Maxine Waters to hold her accountable for not only doing nothing to help our district, but for devestating it with her radical socialist policies.
HELP JOE DEFEAT MAXINE »
Maxine's district – my home – is overrun with crime, drugs, violence, poverty, and homelessness. Yet, her focus is on attacking Donald Trump from the comfort of her $6 million mansion outside the district.
And because she has no accomplishments to stand on, she's counting on attacking my military service record and my support for President Trump in order to keep her seat.
My mission is two-fold:
1. Defeat Maxine so we can began repairing the damage she and her failed policies have done to Los Angeles
2. Make sure these destructive policies don't spread to your community and the rest of our country
We have less than two weeks to succeed in kicking Maxine out of Congress and I need your help. Will you chip in $25, $40, $100 or more to help me and my campaign get the job done?

Fellow patriot – I'm Joe Collins, the Republican and Navy veteran running for Congress against Maxine Waters. You've probably seen my new ad ""Mansion Maxine"" on social media:
Mansion Maxine
Maxine Waters has ""represented"" Los Angeles for 44 years, but things are so bad here that even she refuses to live in our district.
While Maxine sits in her out-of-district mansion, the rest of us have to live with the crime, violence, drugs, poverty and homelessness that her decades of failed radical policies have created.
I'm running for Congress to undo the mess that Maxine Waters has created, and I need your help to defeat her in just a few weeks.
Will you help me kick Maxine Waters out of Congress and fight for safe streets and a strong economy by chipping in $25, $50, $100 or more now?
HELP JOE DEFEAT MAXINE »
When I turned 18, I joined the U.S. Navy. During my service, I was deployed to a combat zone during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
But while I was away serving my country and fighting in a war, Maxine Waters couldn't even be bothered to fight for our own community. So when I returned home from war, it was our district that looked like a war zone.
Los Angeles deserves better! America deserves better!
I need your help to hold Maxine Waters accountable for her failed soclialist policies, fix the mess she's created in our community, and ensure what has happened in Los Angeles doesn't happen to the rest of our country.
With just weeks left until Election Day, will you chip in $25, $50, $100 or even more to help me defeat Maxine Waters and restore responsible leadership in Congress?

Friend,
It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
For the sake of American strength, jobs, law and order, our lives, and our liberties, we must defeat this radical duo on Election Day. The stakes have never been higher, and we need your help to send a message that this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS.

589,"ROGER STONE
Dear Alex,
I have shocking news. It is truly a life or death situation. Let me explain. My family and I are still in shock.
As you know, back in January I was the victim of a political hit-job by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’ Witch Hunt and was convicted on totally fabricated charges of lying to Congress by a vicious Obama appointed Left-wing Judge, a stacked jury of all Trump-hating Democrats and a corrupt Jury Forewoman.
I was essentially prosecuted because I refused under enormous legal and financial pressure to lie and become a witness against the President who I have known for 40 years and who I spoke to on the phone throughout his historic 2016 Campaign. Mueller’s Dirty Cops had the records of all those phone calls and wanted me to lie about what was discussed in order to impeach the President. I refused.
I was convicted in this political lynching and sentence to almost four years in prison plus two years of supervised probation. I immediately filed a notice of appeal based on the blatant misconduct of the Jury Forewoman. That appeal-if I live long enough to see it through- could take over a year and cost $1 million.
Here is the shocking news- Last week the US Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice told us that Attorney General Barr’s directives to the BOP that inmates convicted of non-violent crimes be transferred from prison to home confinement applies to Democrat super-lawyer Michael Avenatti who was convicted of stealing $25 million from his clients and still faces trial on additional charges, Rick Gates the former Trump campaign official who lied in his testimony against me at my trial and Michael Cohen, the former Trump lawyer who was found guilty of criminal fraud and multiple million dollar tax-evasion and then made a deal to testify against the President\- but NOT to Roger Stone. All these anti-Trump criminals have been released to home confinement.
Rather than home confinement, as ABC news reported today, I have been ordered to surrender to a COVID-19 infested prison in Georgia in just nine days. At 67 years old and with a lifelong history of asthma this is a DEATH SENTENCE!
Here is the proof that I am days away from going to this dangerous prison far from my home and family.
Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Georgia in recent weeks The Prison facility in Jessup has several confirmed cases, awaits tests results of 23 more inmates with symptom and has yet to even test some 1400 other inmates. USA Today reported last week that the BOP handling of COVID-19 has been a disaster and that there is evidence that they are misleading the public about how may cases they really have.
I have no choice but to file an EMERGENCY MOTION with the court that includes my medical records and extensive information from my doctor in a last-minute effort to extend my surrender date at least until the coronavirus crisis in our prisons has passed. We have 24 hours to do that.
This is a LIFE AND DEATH situation. It is clear that the Deep State wants to kill me because I refused to turn on the President and to avenge the 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton.
PLEASE GIVE TO THE STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
President Trump himself has said my trial and conviction was a “miscarriage of Justice” that I was treated “very unfairly” and that my trial was “disgraceful”. I have said openly that I am praying for a commutation of my sentence while my appeal plays out, or even a pardon, but I cannot do that until I have exhausted every legal remedy myself. With this legal motion I will have done so.
I have instructed my new appeals lawyers to prepare a motion challenging this dangerous situation to file in court IMMEDIATELY though I am skeptical about getting a fair ruling from this Judge. My health issues are very real as are the dangers of COVID-19. I don’t understand why I should be treated differently than Avenatti, Cohen, Gates and many others.
My personal physician was contacted just before the weekend and he went to the office Saturday to pulled together all of the records, lab tests and studies that show that a person at my age and in my condition will be highly susceptible to Coronavirus.
But I cannot file this emergency motion in court without your help. We literally don’t have a minute to lose.
As of today, I do not have enough in my STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND to fully pay my lawyers for the complicated legal work that is being done to save me from dying in a coronavirus infested hellhole including the possibility of an emergency appeal to the DC Court of Appeals if Judge Amy Berman Jackson denies me a delay- which based on history is likely.
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
Remember this must all happen in the next NINE days! My wife and family are petrified that I will die of COVID-19 before the election and are outraged by this unfair and unequal treatment!
I am trying to calm them down but I must hear from you.
I know you have been supportive in the past, contributing to help fund my legal defense in what turned out to be an outrageous Soviet-style Show trial in DC last January or signing a petition to the President for Clemency. Can I count on you?
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
This entire horrible ordeal where the legal costs have bankrupted me, the Fake News media has smeared me and the stress of fighting the dirty tactics of Robert Mueller’s now thoroughly discredited Witch-hunt has just worn me down. My wife Nydia now suffers from Rheumatoid Arthritis – Brought on by the stress I am convinced. We are struggling to keep a roof over or head and groceries on the table but I no regrets about my decision to refuse to bare false witness against the President in order to ease the contrived legal danger to myself.
It is only the reaffirmation of my Christian faith in God at the recommendation of Rev. Franklin Graham last January that has given me strength and resolve in this fight for my freedom.
The end is near. Whether I live or die will be decided in the next nine days. I would pay for this myself but I literally have nothing. Please send my Stone Defense Fund whatever you can today.
God Bless You,
Roger Stone
PS -I cannot formally apply for Clemency- either a commutation of sentence or pardon from President Trump, until my legal motions are heard before the trial court and potentially the DC Court of appeals and my legal remedies are exhausted so I need to hear from you today.

It's been a month since I challenged my radical liberal opponent Maxine Waters to a public debate... and silence is all we've gotten in return.
Maxine is hiding from me because she knows she has no defense for how her failed socialist policies have only created more poverty and crime in our community.

Our message is clear:
Conservatives stand together for law enforcement, family values, and our second amendment rights.
Democrats’ stand with rioters, looters, and ANTIFA members who want to destroy our nation’s cities and monuments. Democrats‘ solution to the crime and chaos in our cities is to defund the police, ease our border control, and decrease funding for our military.
This is not what we stand for. We stand together, united, for our great nation’s principles, values, and institutions.
Take a moment to chip in today and show us that you stand together with us as we take on the radical left and continue to work toward victory in November.

Alex, Maxine Waters is hiding from me.
As the Republican nominee running against radical leftist Maxine, I publicly challenged her to a debate at the beginning of the month.
Typical of a 40+ year career politician who has done NOTHING to help her crumbing district, she has ignored my challenge.
But while Maxine Waters is hiding from me, she’s sending gangsters and thugs to my events to harass me and my supporters.
I need your help to flush radical, cowardly Maxine Waters out of hiding and hold her accountable for her failed socialist policies. Please chip in $250, $100, $50 or even just $25 or $10 to support my campaign and help me defeat Maxine.
Flush Maxine out »
Maxine Waters doesn’t care about our community, and she certainly doesn’t care about black lives.
She’s getting rich off of making a career out of viscously attacking President Trump and conservatives like you and me.
Meanwhile, her failed socialist policies have only resulted in more poverty, joblessness, homelessness, crime and violence in our district.
That’s what Maxine Waters has done to my home, and that’s what she’ll do to the rest of the country if we don’t remove her from office – which is why I need your support today.
Maxine Waters needs to face me and her constituents and answer for her failures. I need your help to flush Maxine out of hiding and force her to debate me – then I need your help to defeat her.
For the good of our country, help me hold radical Maxine Waters accountable by making a contribution of $250, $100, $50 or even $25, $10 or another amount today.

I have a serious question for you...
Do you want the rest of America to look like the liberal-controlled, crime-ridden, impoverished, freedomless, feces-covered streets of San Francisco and Los Angeles?

But the liberal politicians who control these derelict cities are already controlling the House of Representatives – Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and Maxine Waters. And now they’re trying to elect San Francisco’s Kamala Harris as VP.

602,"ROGER STONE
Dear Alex,
I have shocking news. It is truly a life or death situation. Let me explain. My family and I are still in shock.
As you know, back in January I was the victim of a political hit-job by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’ Witch Hunt and was convicted on totally fabricated charges of lying to Congress by a vicious Obama appointed Left-wing Judge, a stacked jury of all Trump-hating Democrats and a corrupt Jury Forewoman.
I was essentially prosecuted because I refused under enormous legal and financial pressure to lie and become a witness against the President who I have known for 40 years and who I spoke to on the phone throughout his historic 2016 Campaign. Mueller’s Dirty Cops had the records of all those phone calls and wanted me to lie about what was discussed in order to impeach the President. I refused.
I was convicted in this political lynching and sentence to almost four years in prison plus two years of supervised probation. I immediately filed a notice of appeal based on the blatant misconduct of the Jury Forewoman. That appeal-if I live long enough to see it through- could take over a year and cost $1 million.
Here is the shocking news- Last week the US Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice told us that Attorney General Barr’s directives to the BOP that inmates convicted of non-violent crimes be transferred from prison to home confinement applies to Democrat super-lawyer Michael Avenatti who was convicted of stealing $25 million from his clients and still faces trial on additional charges, Rick Gates the former Trump campaign official who lied in his testimony against me at my trial and Michael Cohen, the former Trump lawyer who was found guilty of criminal fraud and multiple million dollar tax-evasion and then made a deal to testify against the President\- but NOT to Roger Stone. All these anti-Trump criminals have been released to home confinement.
Rather than home confinement, as ABC news reported today, I have been ordered to surrender to a COVID-19 infested prison in Georgia in just nine days. At 67 years old and with a lifelong history of asthma this is a DEATH SENTENCE!
Here is the proof that I am days away from going to this dangerous prison far from my home and family.
Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Georgia in recent weeks The Prison facility in Jessup has several confirmed cases, awaits tests results of 23 more inmates with symptom and has yet to even test some 1400 other inmates. USA Today reported last week that the BOP handling of COVID-19 has been a disaster and that there is evidence that they are misleading the public about how may cases they really have.
I have no choice but to file an EMERGENCY MOTION with the court that includes my medical records and extensive information from my doctor in a last-minute effort to extend my surrender date at least until the coronavirus crisis in our prisons has passed. We have 24 hours to do that.
This is a LIFE AND DEATH situation. It is clear that the Deep State wants to kill me because I refused to turn on the President and to avenge the 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton.
PLEASE GIVE TO THE STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
President Trump himself has said my trial and conviction was a “miscarriage of Justice” that I was treated “very unfairly” and that my trial was “disgraceful”. I have said openly that I am praying for a commutation of my sentence while my appeal plays out, or even a pardon, but I cannot do that until I have exhausted every legal remedy myself. With this legal motion I will have done so.
I have instructed my new appeals lawyers to prepare a motion challenging this dangerous situation to file in court IMMEDIATELY though I am skeptical about getting a fair ruling from this Judge. My health issues are very real as are the dangers of COVID-19. I don’t understand why I should be treated differently than Avenatti, Cohen, Gates and many others.
My personal physician was contacted just before the weekend and he went to the office Saturday to pulled together all of the records, lab tests and studies that show that a person at my age and in my condition will be highly susceptible to Coronavirus.
But I cannot file this emergency motion in court without your help. We literally don’t have a minute to lose.
As of today, I do not have enough in my STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND to fully pay my lawyers for the complicated legal work that is being done to save me from dying in a coronavirus infested hellhole including the possibility of an emergency appeal to the DC Court of Appeals if Judge Amy Berman Jackson denies me a delay- which based on history is likely.
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
Remember this must all happen in the next NINE days! My wife and family are petrified that I will die of COVID-19 before the election and are outraged by this unfair and unequal treatment!
I am trying to calm them down but I must hear from you.
I know you have been supportive in the past, contributing to help fund my legal defense in what turned out to be an outrageous Soviet-style Show trial in DC last January or signing a petition to the President for Clemency. Can I count on you?
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
This entire horrible ordeal where the legal costs have bankrupted me, the Fake News media has smeared me and the stress of fighting the dirty tactics of Robert Mueller’s now thoroughly discredited Witch-hunt has just worn me down. My wife Nydia now suffers from Rheumatoid Arthritis – Brought on by the stress I am convinced. We are struggling to keep a roof over or head and groceries on the table but I no regrets about my decision to refuse to bare false witness against the President in order to ease the contrived legal danger to myself.
It is only the reaffirmation of my Christian faith in God at the recommendation of Rev. Franklin Graham last January that has given me strength and resolve in this fight for my freedom.
The end is near. Whether I live or die will be decided in the next nine days. I would pay for this myself but I literally have nothing. Please send my Stone Defense Fund whatever you can today.
God Bless You,
Roger Stone
PS -I cannot formally apply for Clemency- either a commutation of sentence or pardon from President Trump, until my legal motions are heard before the trial court and potentially the DC Court of appeals and my legal remedies are exhausted so I need to hear from you today.

BREAKING: Joe Biden picks PHONY Kamala Harris as running mate.
Friend,
Wow.
Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn’t get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?).
Next, she ends her pathetic run at President.
Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP.
And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it’s obvious that this radical duo is PERFECT for each other but WRONG for America.
They are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working tirelessly to restore LAW AND ORDER.

Alex,
Maxine Waters is “overjoyed” that racist Joe Biden picked her buddy Kamala Harris to be his running mate, and we shouldn’t be surprised.
Maxine and Kamala are both radical liberals from California cities – Los Angeles and San Francisco – that their failed socialist and corrupt policies have turned into epicenters for homelessness, poverty, crime, high taxation, and high cost of living.
What they’ve done to LA and SF are exactly what they will do to the rest of America unless we stand up and fight back!
I am the Republican nominee running for Congress to defeat Maxine Waters in November, and I need your continued support to ramp up our campaign in these final months.
Help Joe defeat Maxine →
As a black conservative Navy veteran from South-Central Los Angeles, I have what it takes to finally kick Maxine Waters out of Congress.
I spent 13 years in the United States Navy – including a combat tour during Operation Iraqi Freedom – which taught me the importance of integrity, hard work and service to country ... things Maxine Waters absolutely does not comprehend.
She has completely ignored her crumbling district while spending all her time and energy on viciously attacking President Trump and, lately, aggressively pressuring Biden to pick her buddy Kamala as his running mate.
Radical California liberals like Maxine Waters, Pelosi, Schiff and now Kamala Harris have taken over the Democratic Party, and they're working together to push the same failed policies that have destroyed California, only on a national scale.
Maxine Waters is a ringleader of this new regime, and we need to remove her from Congress now before it’s too late.
We have less than three months until the election, so please chip in $10, $25, $50 or even $100 or more to help us push toward the finish line and defeat radical leftist Maxine Waters.

605,"As I'm sure you heard only minutes after the corrupt and left-wing DC Circuit Court of appeals, against all legal precedent, in violation of current Department of Justice and US Bureau of Prison policy and with complete disregard for my age and history of asthma ordered that I surrender to a prison in Georgia where there are now 60 confirmed COVID-19 Cases tomorrow, a near certain death sentence. FROM THE DESK OF ROGER STONE
Alex,
God is good!
As I'm sure you heard only minutes after the corrupt and left-wing DC Circuit Court of appeals, against all legal precedent, in violation of current Department of Justice and US Bureau of Prison policy and with complete disregard for my age and history of asthma ordered that I surrender to a prison in Georgia where there are now 60 confirmed COVID-19 Cases tomorrow, a near certain death sentence…
President Donald Trump in an act of justice and mercy issued a full commutation of my sentence!
Roger Stone
The truth is, my life would never have been saved without your help!
The President knows that I did not receive a fair trial and that I was facing near-certain fatality in a Corona Virus-infected prison in rural Georgia. In an election year, it was an enormous act of courage and loyalty.
The President knows that I was pressured mercilessly to bear false witness against him and lie about the content of multiple phone calls between us during the 2016 presidential campaign. Even though this would have lessened my legal and financial peril, I refused to be used by the Deep Sxtate in their diabolical plan to impeach the President.
A commutation, however, is not a pardon. While my sentence has been commuted, I will remain a convicted felon unless I appeal my conviction and win a new trial. It is my full intention to pursue this appeal to clear my name.
The unconstitutional and corrupt conduct of the judge, the stunning misconduct of the jury forewoman, and the criminal misconduct of Mueller's dirty cops who prosecuted me – all of which were concealed in my original trial by the judge, will be fully exposed know that I know I will live long enough to get a hearing of my appeal.
Even worse, many powerful Democrats and CNN are demanding that New York State bring a new prosecution against me based on the false claim that I sought to conceal misconduct by the President (when in fact I refused to bear false witness against him) and traded this for the commutation of my sentence – it is a lie! My lawyers now anticipate an entirely new fight in New York State where the state Attorney General is an anti-Trump psychopath and the Manhattan District Attorney is already scrutinizing every business transaction President Trump did as a private citizen looking for something – anything – to prosecute him for.
It is not coincidental that only hours before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals voted 3 - 0 send me to my death, and the president stepped in in the knick of time to save me from this gross injustice. Facebook announced that I would be banned from their platform for life as well as being banned on the Instagram platform which they own.
They base this outrageous act of censorship on the false claim arising from the Mueller report that I owned and operated 100 ""Fake"" Facebook pages. This claim – which was the conclusion of a left-wing New York research firm is 100 percent false. I have never owned or operated any Facebook page in the name of another person or in the name of a political organization that did not legitimately exist.
This was clearly an effort to silence me at the same time as they were essentially planning to lynch me.
Now I have no choice but to wage a three-front battle. I must finance an appeal to overturn my verdict to clear my name. When the President called to tell me that he had commuted my sentence, he strongly urged me to pursue this appeal. I must finance a defense if New York State seeks essentially to retry me on Mueller's false charges and I must also sue Facebook as well as the New York based research firm that created this phony report in order to get my voice back.
Needless to say, these 3 battles could cost another $2 million. Thanks to your generosity, I have raised and spent almost $2 million in my initial legal defense, but now realize that it didn't matter how much I spent for lawyers or how skilled those lawyers were, my trial in DC was rigged from the beginning.
Won't you help me finish and win this vital fight? Won't you please consider a contribution to the STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND today?
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND »
I always thought that this completely phony investigation and the trumped-up charges against me were always designed to ensure that I was off the battlefield in 2020. Although I have signed up at Parler – a great new social media platform that does not censor Republicans, Conservatives, or Trump supporters, it is clear that the Deep State and their Silicon Valley collaborators want to limit my voice in the upcoming presidential showdown.
If you have seen the latest polls you know that the deadly COVID-19 virus has destroyed the strongest and most vibrant economic comeback in our Nation's history – destroying President Trump's signature accomplishments, record job growth, record wage growth, and a record level of employment have been brought low when the President had no choice but to protect the public health. This economic crash explains why the President is running slightly behind his democratic opponent Joe Biden in virtually every swing state.
I urgently need to put this appeal behind me and maximize my voice on social media in order to do what I did in 2016, which is to work hard to win this election for the President. I need your help to do that.
God bless you for all you have done for me and my family in this horrific ordeal.
Even today Robert Mueller, Rod Rosenstein, Andrew Weissmann, Adam Schiff, and Jerry Nadler are recycling all of their most vicious falsehoods and claiming yet again that I was colluding with Russian Intelligence to benefit the Trump Campaign in 2016. They just keep recycling the same lies even though they know that Mueller's investigation never produced any evidence whatsoever that this was true and even after Mueller's invasive investigation, I was never charged with any such crime.
This ordeal has left me broke, having lost my home, my savings, most of our insurance, and my car. We continue to struggle to pay for rent, groceries, utilities, gasoline (my wife's car is 10 years old), medical expenses, and prescription drugs. I am excited to know that I can get back to making a living and rebuild our life but, in the meantime, if you want to help my family you can give to the STONE FAMILY SUPPORT FUND.
I will keep fighting but I need your help today.
God Bless You,

606,"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris | It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
TRUMP PENCE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Friend,
It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
For the sake of American strength, jobs, law and order, our lives, and our liberties, we must defeat this radical duo on Election Day. The stakes have never been higher, and we need your help to send a message that this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS.
For the NEXT HOUR, all contributions will be 600%-MATCHED!
Please contribute $42 in the NEXT HOUR to FIGHT for President Trump and your gift will be 600%-MATCHED. >>
Fight for Your Country! Contribute Now.
CONTRIBUTE $250 = $1750 CONTRIBUTE $100 = $700 CONTRIBUTE $50 = $350
CONTRIBUTE $42 = $294 CONTRIBUTE ANY AMOUNT
Electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November would be a grave mistake for this Nation with irreversible consequences. They will raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators.
We cannot allow our Nation to go down that path, Friend.
President Trump and I are counting on our BEST supporters right now. Can we count on YOU to step up during this critical time?
Please contribute $42 IMMEDIATELY to help us WIN BIG in November and your gift will be instantly 600%-MATCHED.
Thank you,
Vice President Mike Pence Signature Headshot
Mike Pence
Vice President of the United States
P.S. I want you to know that no matter what the Left throws at us, we are not going anywhere. President Trump and I will fight for you every single day. As long as we have YOU on our team, we will WIN on November 3rd. Contribute NOW. >>

607,"I am determined to defeat Maxine because I have witnessed firsthand how her radical socialist policies have failed and even destroyed my community. Joe Collins for Congress
Alex,
I’m the Republican nominee taking on Maxine Waters, but as a black man I’m not your typical Republican.
I am determined to defeat Maxine because I have witnessed firsthand how her radical socialist policies have failed and even destroyed my community. I refuse to let her destroy the rest of our country.
HELP JOE DEFEAT MAXINE »
I grew up in South-Central Los Angeles in the district Maxine is supposed to – but refuses to – represent in Congress.
Maxine’s policies are responsible for the poverty, crime and violence that plague our community... they’re responsible for the drive-by shooting that left bullet holes in my family’s windows and sofa when I was young.
After serving my country in the U.S. Navy, which included a combat tour as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, I have decided to serve my community and my country again and rescue us from Maxine Waters.
But to achieve this, I need help from other conservative patriots, like you.
Our campaign has already raised over $3 million to defeat Maxine. Victory is within grasp, but it’s going to take continued effort and support from every corner of the nation to kick her out of office after more than four decades.
Will you support our grassroots campaign with a contribution of $25 or more and help this black conservative Navy veteran defeat radical socialist Maxine Waters?
DEFEAT MAXINE »
Maxine is not only a failure; she is openly hateful toward conservatives like you and me and has dedicated her entire attention to trying to impeach our President rather than serving her constituents.
It’s time for Maxine Waters to go!

Fellow Patriot, my friend Dr. Roger Marshall is OUR Republican U.S. Senate nominee in Kansas — and he needs your help to WIN!
Roger has served our country in the military. He’s strong on crime and securing the border, he’s fighting for our farmers, and he stood with me from DAY ONE against the Democrats’ impeachment SHAM.
Because Roger is with US — not the SWAMP — he has a target on his back. Chuck Schumer and the radical Democrats have raised $10 MILLION to defeat him.
Fellow Patriot, control of the U.S. Senate is at stake — and it’s critical that YOU step up to help my friend Roger Marshall defend OUR Republican majority. Can you rush a generous donation RIGHT NOW?
DONATE $250
DONATE $100
RUSH DONATE $42
DONATE OTHER AMOUNT
Chuck Schumer and the Democrats only need to flip FOUR SEATS to win the Senate — and they’re doing everything they can to defeat my friend Roger Marshall.
They’re raising MILLIONS from liberal mega-donors and Swamp special interests to prop up Roger’s opponent, Barbara Bollier. She is nothing but a rubberstamp for their SOCIALIST agenda.
Unlike the unhinged liberals, Roger Marshall is a champion of our America First agenda — and he has my FULL SUPPORT!
I’m personally asking 7,500 conservatives like YOU to step up and help Roger Marshall WIN in Kansas and defend our U.S. Senate majority.
Your president needs you. Roger Marshall needs you. Everything is at stake in this election, and I need YOU to help conservative champions like Roger Marshall defend OUR Senate majority!
Rush a donation of any amount to help my friend Roger Marshall NOW. Please don’t let us down.
Thank you,

Typical of a 40+ year career politician who has done NOTHING to help her crumbing district, she has ignored my challenge.

Maxine Waters doesn’t care about our community, and she certainly doesn’t care about black lives.
She’s getting rich off of making a career out of viscously attacking President Trump and conservatives like you and me.
Meanwhile, her failed socialist policies have only resulted in more poverty, joblessness, homelessness, crime and violence in our district.
That’s what Maxine Waters has done to my home, and that’s what she’ll do to the rest of the country if we don’t remove her from office – which is why I need your support today.
Maxine Waters needs to face me and her constituents and answer for her failures. I need your help to flush Maxine out of hiding and force her to debate me – then I need your help to defeat her.

Fellow patriot,
I'm Joe Collins, the Republican and Navy veteran running for Congress against Maxine Waters. You've probably seen my new ad ""Mansion Maxine"" on social media:
Mansion Maxine
Maxine Waters has ""represented"" Los Angeles for 44 years, but things are so bad here that even she refuses to live in our district.
While Maxine sits in her out-of-district mansion, the rest of us have to live with the crime, violence, drugs, poverty and homelessness that her decades of failed radical policies have created.
I'm running for Congress to undo the mess that Maxine Waters has created, and I need your help to defeat her in just a few weeks.
Will you help me kick Maxine Waters out of Congress and fight for safe streets and a strong economy by chipping in $25, $50, $100 or more now?
HELP JOE DEFEAT MAXINE »
When I turned 18, I joined the U.S. Navy. During my service, I was deployed to a combat zone during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
But while I was away serving my country and fighting in a war, Maxine Waters couldn't even be bothered to fight for our own community. So when I returned home from war, it was our district that looked like a war zone.
Los Angeles deserves better! America deserves better!
I need your help to hold Maxine Waters accountable for her failed soclialist policies, fix the mess she's created in our community, and ensure what has happened in Los Angeles doesn't happen to the rest of our country.
With just weeks left until Election Day, will you chip in $25, $50, $100 or even more to help me defeat Maxine Waters and restore responsible leadership in Congress?

She spends all her time trying to impeach President Trump and attacking his supporters and zero time serving her district – which is why California's 43rd is suffering heavily from crime, violence, drugs, joblessness, poverty and homelessness.
What's happened to our district under Maxine's watch is the same thing that will happen to the rest of the country if we let her and her radical allies take control and implement their socialist and lawless agenda.
Maxine Waters MUST be held accountable and forced to explain herself to her consituents, so I am calling her out for a debate and I need you to get my back.
Please help me kick radical, hateful and failed politician Maxine Waters out of Congress by chipping in $35 or more right now.
Get Joe's Back!

Alex,
I'm Joe Collins, the Republican and Navy veteran running for Congress against Maxine Waters. You've probably seen my new ad ""Mansion Maxine"" on social media:
Mansion Maxine
Maxine Waters has ""represented"" Los Angeles for 44 years, but things are so bad here that even she refuses to live in our district.
While Maxine sits in her out-of-district mansion, the rest of us have to live with the crime, violence, drugs, poverty and homelessness that her decades of failed radical policies have created.
I'm running for Congress to undo the mess that Maxine Waters has created, and I need your help to defeat her in just a few weeks.
Will you help me kick Maxine Waters out of Congress and fight for safe streets and a strong economy by chipping in $25, $50, $100 or more now?
HELP JOE DEFEAT MAXINE »
When I turned 18, I joined the U.S. Navy. During my service, I was deployed to a combat zone during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
But while I was away serving my country and fighting in a war, Maxine Waters couldn't even be bothered to fight for our own community. So when I returned home from war, it was our district that looked like a war zone.
Los Angeles deserves better! America deserves better!
I need your help to hold Maxine Waters accountable for her failed soclialist policies, fix the mess she's created in our community, and ensure what has happened in Los Angeles doesn't happen to the rest of our country.

628,"ROGER STONE
Dear Alex,
I have shocking news. It is truly a life or death situation. Let me explain. My family and I are still in shock.
As you know, back in January I was the victim of a political hit-job by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’ Witch Hunt and was convicted on totally fabricated charges of lying to Congress by a vicious Obama appointed Left-wing Judge, a stacked jury of all Trump-hating Democrats and a corrupt Jury Forewoman.
I was essentially prosecuted because I refused under enormous legal and financial pressure to lie and become a witness against the President who I have known for 40 years and who I spoke to on the phone throughout his historic 2016 Campaign. Mueller’s Dirty Cops had the records of all those phone calls and wanted me to lie about what was discussed in order to impeach the President. I refused.
I was convicted in this political lynching and sentence to almost four years in prison plus two years of supervised probation. I immediately filed a notice of appeal based on the blatant misconduct of the Jury Forewoman. That appeal-if I live long enough to see it through- could take over a year and cost $1 million.
Here is the shocking news- Last week the US Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice told us that Attorney General Barr’s directives to the BOP that inmates convicted of non-violent crimes be transferred from prison to home confinement applies to Democrat super-lawyer Michael Avenatti who was convicted of stealing $25 million from his clients and still faces trial on additional charges, Rick Gates the former Trump campaign official who lied in his testimony against me at my trial and Michael Cohen, the former Trump lawyer who was found guilty of criminal fraud and multiple million dollar tax-evasion and then made a deal to testify against the President\- but NOT to Roger Stone. All these anti-Trump criminals have been released to home confinement.
Rather than home confinement, as ABC news reported today, I have been ordered to surrender to a COVID-19 infested prison in Georgia in just nine days. At 67 years old and with a lifelong history of asthma this is a DEATH SENTENCE!
Here is the proof that I am days away from going to this dangerous prison far from my home and family.
Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Georgia in recent weeks The Prison facility in Jessup has several confirmed cases, awaits tests results of 23 more inmates with symptom and has yet to even test some 1400 other inmates. USA Today reported last week that the BOP handling of COVID-19 has been a disaster and that there is evidence that they are misleading the public about how may cases they really have.
I have no choice but to file an EMERGENCY MOTION with the court that includes my medical records and extensive information from my doctor in a last-minute effort to extend my surrender date at least until the coronavirus crisis in our prisons has passed. We have 24 hours to do that.
This is a LIFE AND DEATH situation. It is clear that the Deep State wants to kill me because I refused to turn on the President and to avenge the 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton.
PLEASE GIVE TO THE STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
President Trump himself has said my trial and conviction was a “miscarriage of Justice” that I was treated “very unfairly” and that my trial was “disgraceful”. I have said openly that I am praying for a commutation of my sentence while my appeal plays out, or even a pardon, but I cannot do that until I have exhausted every legal remedy myself. With this legal motion I will have done so.
I have instructed my new appeals lawyers to prepare a motion challenging this dangerous situation to file in court IMMEDIATELY though I am skeptical about getting a fair ruling from this Judge. My health issues are very real as are the dangers of COVID-19. I don’t understand why I should be treated differently than Avenatti, Cohen, Gates and many others.
My personal physician was contacted just before the weekend and he went to the office Saturday to pulled together all of the records, lab tests and studies that show that a person at my age and in my condition will be highly susceptible to Coronavirus.
But I cannot file this emergency motion in court without your help. We literally don’t have a minute to lose.
As of today, I do not have enough in my STONE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND to fully pay my lawyers for the complicated legal work that is being done to save me from dying in a coronavirus infested hellhole including the possibility of an emergency appeal to the DC Court of Appeals if Judge Amy Berman Jackson denies me a delay- which based on history is likely.
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
Remember this must all happen in the next NINE days! My wife and family are petrified that I will die of COVID-19 before the election and are outraged by this unfair and unequal treatment!
I am trying to calm them down but I must hear from you.
I know you have been supportive in the past, contributing to help fund my legal defense in what turned out to be an outrageous Soviet-style Show trial in DC last January or signing a petition to the President for Clemency. Can I count on you?
GIVE TO THE STONE DEFENSE FUND
This entire horrible ordeal where the legal costs have bankrupted me, the Fake News media has smeared me and the stress of fighting the dirty tactics of Robert Mueller’s now thoroughly discredited Witch-hunt has just worn me down. My wife Nydia now suffers from Rheumatoid Arthritis – Brought on by the stress I am convinced. We are struggling to keep a roof over or head and groceries on the table but I no regrets about my decision to refuse to bare false witness against the President in order to ease the contrived legal danger to myself.
It is only the reaffirmation of my Christian faith in God at the recommendation of Rev. Franklin Graham last January that has given me strength and resolve in this fight for my freedom.
The end is near. Whether I live or die will be decided in the next nine days. I would pay for this myself but I literally have nothing. Please send my Stone Defense Fund whatever you can today.
God Bless You,
Roger Stone
PS -I cannot formally apply for Clemency- either a commutation of sentence or pardon from President Trump, until my legal motions are heard before the trial court and potentially the DC Court of appeals and my legal remedies are exhausted so I need to hear from you today.

Friend,
It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
For the sake of American strength, jobs, law and order, our lives, and our liberties, we must defeat this radical duo on Election Day. The stakes have never been higher, and we need your help to send a message that this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS.

I’m the Republican nominee taking on Maxine Waters, but as a black man I’m not your typical Republican.
I am determined to defeat Maxine because I have witnessed firsthand how her radical socialist policies have failed and even destroyed my community. I refuse to let her destroy the rest of our country.
HELP JOE DEFEAT MAXINE »
I grew up in South-Central Los Angeles in the district Maxine is supposed to – but refuses to – represent in Congress.
Maxine’s policies are responsible for the poverty, crime and violence that plague our community... they’re responsible for the drive-by shooting that left bullet holes in my family’s windows and sofa when I was young.
After serving my country in the U.S. Navy, which included a combat tour as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, I have decided to serve my community and my country again and rescue us from Maxine Waters.
But to achieve this, I need help from other conservative patriots, like you.
Our campaign has already raised over $3 million to defeat Maxine. Victory is within grasp, but it’s going to take continued effort and support from every corner of the nation to kick her out of office after more than four decades.
Will you support our grassroots campaign with a contribution of $25 or more and help this black conservative Navy veteran defeat radical socialist Maxine Waters?
DEFEAT MAXINE »
Maxine is not only a failure; she is openly hateful toward conservatives like you and me and has dedicated her entire attention to trying to impeach our President rather than serving her constituents.
It’s time for Maxine Waters to go!
Don’t let hateful socialist Maxine Waters go unopposed any longer. Chip in $25 or more now and help me give Maxine the boot!
Thanks,
Joe Collins

Our message is clear:
Conservatives stand together for law enforcement, family values, and our second amendment rights.
Democrats’ stand with rioters, looters, and ANTIFA members who want to destroy our nation’s cities and monuments. Democrats‘ solution to the crime and chaos in our cities is to defund the police, ease our border control, and decrease funding for our military.
This is not what we stand for. We stand together, united, for our great nation’s principles, values, and institutions.
Take a moment to chip in today and show us that you stand together with us as we take on the radical left and continue to work toward victory in November.

Friend,
Did you see the President’s last email?
It’s going to be President Trump and Vice President Pence on the ballot against two of our Nation’s most RADICAL Democrats: Sleepy Joe Biden and Phony Kamala Harris.
Both of them are corrupt career politicians who LOVE anarchy and HATE America. They are WEAK on crime and they would DESTROY everything we’ve worked so hard for.
We know that Joe and Kamala don’t stand a chance against President Trump and Vice President Pence, but we can’t ignore the fact they are being FLOODED with dirty Mega Donor Money coming from ELITES who live on the COAST.
It’s REAL Americans vs. SOCIALISTS, and President Trump is calling on YOU to step up and make a statement that AMERICA IS NOT FOR SALE.

* Kamala embraced Bernie Sanders plan for SOCIALIZED medicine
* She called for TRILLIONS in new taxes

TRUMP PENCE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
BREAKING: Joe Biden picks PHONY Kamala Harris as running mate.
Friend,
Wow.
Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn’t get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?).
Next, she ends her pathetic run at President.
Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP.
And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it’s obvious that this radical duo is PERFECT for each other but WRONG for America.
They are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working tirelessly to restore LAW AND ORDER.
It’s going to be up to Patriots like YOU to save our Nation from that dark fate, Friend. Election Day is right around the corner, and now that we know what we’re up against, I’m going to do something HUGE:

Alex,
I'm Joe Collins, the Republican and Navy veteran running for Congress against Maxine Waters. You've probably seen my new ad ""Mansion Maxine"" on social media:
Mansion Maxine
Maxine Waters has ""represented"" Los Angeles for 44 years, but things are so bad here that even she refuses to live in our district.
While Maxine sits in her out-of-district mansion, the rest of us have to live with the crime, violence, drugs, poverty and homelessness that her decades of failed radical policies have created.
I'm running for Congress to undo the mess that Maxine Waters has created, and I need your help to defeat her in just a few weeks.
Will you help me kick Maxine Waters out of Congress and fight for safe streets and a strong economy by chipping in $25, $50, $100 or more now?
HELP JOE DEFEAT MAXINE »
When I turned 18, I joined the U.S. Navy. During my service, I was deployed to a combat zone during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
But while I was away serving my country and fighting in a war, Maxine Waters couldn't even be bothered to fight for our own community. So when I returned home from war, it was our district that looked like a war zone.
Los Angeles deserves better! America deserves better!
I need your help to hold Maxine Waters accountable for her failed soclialist policies, fix the mess she's created in our community, and ensure what has happened in Los Angeles doesn't happen to the rest of our country.
With just weeks left until Election Day, will you chip in $25, $50, $100 or even more to help me defeat Maxine Waters and restore responsible leadership in Congress?

* Your Freedoms
* Your Safety and Security
Today’s Democrat Party is so radical they want to fundamentally dismantle America and have used this virus as an excuse to implement their quest for total government control of our lives.
In New York, we have watched violent crime sweep our streets. While innocent people are being killed, Governor Cuomo is focused on dictating to you what you must eat when you’re sitting down for a drink.
THIS IS MADNESS. The NYGOP agenda, carried by our great slate of 2020 candidates, is fighting to restore sanity, freedom and safety to New York.
We only have 100 days to help get our message out far and wide. Help us give our candidates the resources they need to stand up and fight back against the Democrats’ dangerous agenda.

New Yorkers will have a choice between two different paths...

NYGOP Chairman Nick Langworthy Calls for Cuomo, State Leaders to Condemn Democrat Socialists of America Violence and Riot Against President Trump Supporters in Ithaca
\--
Perpetrators Must be Prosecuted
Calls for Radical Cornell Professor Celebrating the Violence to Be Terminated
New York--October 17, [[URL REDACTED]] New York Republican Party today called on Governor Andrew Cuomo and the state’s Democrat leaders to condemn the violent protest and riot led by the Democrat Socialists of America’s Ithaca chapter yesterday and for the perpetrators who committed crimes to be prosecuted.
Democrat socialists descended on Republicans who organized a peaceful rally in support of President Trump in front of the Tompkins Republican Party campaign headquarters. Members of the DSA initiated violence, threats, destruction of property and forced the shutdown of the highway while cornering the President’s supporters.
A female Trump supporter had to be taken to the hospital after her shoulder was dislocated, rioters were ripping signs and hats from supporters and burning them while threatening their safety. The campaign headquarters was spray painted with “Trump Dies” and “Jesus Hates Cops.” Police were forced to close Route 13 as protestors yelled at them “Cops and Klan go hand in hand.” DSA members cornered the President’s supporters forcing them inside their building.
Despite news reports detailing what happened, no Democrats, including local candidates Tracy Mitrano who is running for Congress and Leslie Danks Burke who is running for state senate have come out to condemn the violence.
“The violence and rioting of Democrat Socialists against peaceful New Yorkers exercising their First Amendment rights is disgusting and must be unequivocally condemned by our state’s leaders,” said New York Republican Chairman Nick Langworthy. “The perpetrators of this violence must be prosecuted and there must be a clear message that this behavior will not be tolerated. It is the radical left who is filled with hate and violence and they must be stopped.”
“From their social media postings and what happened it looks like these Democrat Socialists came looking for trouble and to deprive the Republican rallies of their civil rights, using violence and intimidation to do so,” said Tompkins County Republican Chairman Mike Sigler. “They were an angry mob who terrorized people. Some were physically hurt and they destroyed our property. The vitriol and hate against people who don’t share their authoritarian views is nothing short of reprehensible. This is what we are fighting against in this election.”
Chairman Langworthy also blasted radical Cornell History Professor Russell Rickford, a member of the DSA for celebrating the violent event and calling it a “joyful display” and “positive affirmation of an alternative politics.”
He concluded, “Any adult who celebrates violence, destruction of property and physically threatening another human being has no business being employed by an educational institution. He completely crossed the line with his actions and his comments and he should be immediately terminated. Shame on him.”

I wanted to personally make sure you saw my team’s email from earlier today. We have such an important election coming up -- it will be the fight between a free America and a socialist America . . . between a safe and secure America and an America of defunded police, riots, looting, and crime. I NEED your support now more than ever. Donate to our Stop Radical Nancy Fund to support my re-election campaign and make a huge difference TODAY >>>
Nancy Pelosi is using millions of dollars to secure NY-01 for my opponent. Pelosi knows how important our district is to her continued grip over the House, which is why she will stop at NOTHING to try to silence us.
Stop the Radical Nancies
It’s NOW OR NEVER, Alex. This end-of-month deadline that ends at MIDNIGHT is an important moment to help change New York’s future and we are still $4,970 away from our goal. This is so important that TRIPLE-MATCHING is still activated!
We can do this together.
Thank you,
Lee

Alex,
They aren’t even keeping it a secret anymore. The Democrats want to buy our Congressional seat out from under us. Nancy Pelosi KNOWS how important NY-01 is to them keeping the House in November, which is why they’re POURING money into our district. She wants to put Radical Professor Nancy Goroff in Lee’s seat to act as her far-left puppet. We already have too many of those in Congress!
Alex, we can stop them. It took EVERYTHING we had to win in 2018, and this year, the far-left radicals are coming back harder than ever. But we can’t let them take the Long Island we know and love and turn it into a higher taxed socialist haven of eroded public safety and quality of life. This is why we’re asking for your donation TODAY to our Stop Radical Nancy Fund to help re-elect Lee.
Alex, we need you.

Our August end-of-month deadline is at MIDNIGHT TONIGHT and we are still $9,180 short. This is one of your best opportunities to make a profound impact on the outcome of November’s election, Alex.

BREAKING NEWS: DEMOCRATS IMPEACH PRESIDENT TRUMP
Alex,
The Democrats did it.
After months of Adam Schiff’s scheming in the basement of the Capitol, the Democrats voted to impeach President Trump with ZERO crimes committed and NO impeachable offenses found.
This is completely outrageous! The Democrats and their media allies have been trying to spin-up allegations against President Trump since the day he won in 2016.
Alex, I’ve been fighting back against impeachment since day one. Now is not the time to give up; it’s time to double down fighting back against their ridiculous SCAMS and political schemes.
Join me in fighting back.
Rush in your emergency donation tonight >>
Fight Back
We cannot let the radical left get away with this.
I’m serious, I’ve never seen our country so divided. I’m standing by President Trump’s side and your side because our country is depending on him to keep us together during a time when the left has just ripped us apart.

In Case You Missed It…
[[URL REDACTED]] Launched Highlighting Radical Professor Nancy Goroff’s Anti-Police Rhetoric and Policies
[[URL REDACTED]] shines a spotlight on Goroff’s record of dangerous anti-police policies and statements in 2020, including:
• Calling the police “dangerous”
• Refusing to condemn the rioting, looting, and violence against police
• Calling for non-police to be sent in response to domestic violence crime scenes, instead of sending police
• Pushing legislation that would implement cashless bail nationwide and institute a massive prison release, including violent prisoners
• Refusing to support federal funding to help law enforcement eliminate MS-13
• Criticizing riot gear being given to police to respond to riots
Goroff is running against Congressman Lee Zeldin (R, NY-1) who, on the other hand, is a strong, outspoken, and unapologetic supporter of our law enforcement, military, first responders, and veterans.

Alex,
Everything is on the line in November. From safety and security to peace and prosperity, this is an election where we must stand up and fight for the country we want, and we cannot be quiet. The crime we are witnessing in NYC, Portland, Chicago, and Seattle is a warning shot of what will spread throughout America if we don’t fight for our nation RIGHT NOW -- this is not a drill.
Have you decided who you’re voting for in November? Lee sent you a poll a few days ago to ask you, Alex -- but you haven’t responded. We’re curious! Respond now >>>
Lee understands that this election is all about the future of our nation. With less than 80 days until Election Day, take 15 seconds to let Lee know who you think should be elected this November.

ICYMI: Last week, I launched my first TV ad of this 2020 campaign for Congress. It's a 60 second ad, called ""Unapologetic"", about my support for our amazing law enforcement officers who risk their lives to keep our streets safe.
They deserve MORE support, not less, and certainly shouldn't be defunded. Many people even want to dangerously replace/prevent them from responding to calls at locations like domestic violence crime scenes!
The rioting, looting and violent attacks we have witnessed in US cities like New York City, Chicago, Seattle and Portland aren't what American streets should ever look like.
Now more than ever, we must support safety and security and our men and women in blue!

“Radical Professor”
Alex,
This is shocking. Instead of prioritizing safety and security, and law and order, in the midst of all the looting, rioting and violence targeting police and others on US city streets in recent months, Lee’s opponent, Radical Professor Nancy Goroff, is stabbing our police in the back!
Alex, you’re going to want to see this:
Alternate text
Radical Professor Nancy Goroff has fully embraced an extreme anti-law enforcement agenda:
* Calling the police ""damaging"" and ""dangerous""
* Saying that non-police should be sent to respond to domestic violence crime scenes instead of sending police
* Pushing legislation calling for a mass prison release, including violent criminals
* Complaining about riot gear being given to police to respond to violent riots
* Refusing to condemn the violence against police and others on U.S. city streets
Lee Zeldin, on the other hand, fully and unapologetically supports our police officers who put their lives on the line every day. Help Lee keep this new TV ad on air by donating $25 or more today!
Alex, we cannot reward the bad behavior of rioters and looters with more power in Washington. Politicians like Radical Professor Nancy Goroff are too weak to stand up AGAINST the far left and too weak to stand up FOR our amazing men and women in blue. Election Day is right around the corner, and we cannot take ANYTHING for granted.

Alex,
In the 50 days since Albany Democrats’ new Cashless Bail law has been in effect, an unprecedented number criminals have been instantly released back into our communities to commit more crimes.
Just last weekend in NYC, a thief thanked Democrats for releasing him after his 139th arrest saying, “Bail reform, it’s lit!... It’s the Democrats! The Democrats know me and the Republicans fear me. You can’t touch me! I can’t be stopped!”
This man had previously received several stints in prison and committed 6 felonies, 87 misdemeanors, and had 21 court hearings.
Alex, cashless bail does not need tiny changes... it needs a full repeal ASAP. Do you agree? Let Lee know here >>>
Instead of handcuffing criminals, Democrats are handcuffing Lady Justice, but I want to know where YOU stand, Alex.
Do you support the new Cashless Bail law?

Over 14 law enforcement organizations just endorsed Congressman Lee Zeldin’s re-election campaign over his opponent. Why?
This is Lee’s radical opponent who thinks social workers should be sent to domestic violence crime scenes instead of police:

She even refuses to condemn any of the rioting in cities across America and attacks on our great men and women in blue.
Meanwhile, Congressman Zeldin, who grew up in a law enforcement household, strongly believes we should be supporting our police MORE, not less.

I have always unapologetically supported our brave law enforcement officers. The many dangerous attacks right now on our law enforcement are an attack on the safety of every man, woman, and child in our communities and I'm not going to support any of it. The contrast between my opponent and I on this couldn't be any clearer. Radical Professor Nancy Goroff embraces anti-police proposals and rhetoric:
• Calls the police ""damaging"" and ""dangerous""
• Says that non-police should be sent to respond to domestic violence crime scenes instead of police
• Pushes legislation calling for a mass prison release, including violent criminals
• Complains about riot gear being given to police to respond to riots
• Refused to condemn the violence against police and others on US city streets
We cannot reward the bad behavior of rioters and looters with more power in Washington. We cannot give power to politicians like Goroff too weak to stand up AGAINST the far left and too weak to stand up FOR our amazing men and women in blue! Election Day is just around the corner on November 3rd and we cannot take absolutely anything for granted this year, especially with the awful crop of politicians who are running for Congress to continue propping up Nancy Pelosi as Speaker. Everything is at stake. This is the most important election of our lifetime and losing is not an option!

Growing up in a law enforcement home, Lee understands exactly how hard our law enforcement officers work to protect our communities. They put their lives on the line every single day, and as payback for their efforts, they are under attack by the left.
While crimes are skyrocketing, our opponent and the Democrats are working to defund our police officers. Our nation is at a true crossroads. Will we remain a free nation or will we become a crime-infested nation that defunds our police officers? Respond now >>>
De Blasio is leading New York down the path to completely defund the police and let violent criminals run wild and free. Our opponent will empower the same violent and radical agenda right here on Long Island.
For months, Lee has been warning us that this election is all about the fight against the rise of socialism and the radical left -- and now it’s knocking on our door.

Alex,
Look at these tragic headlines: “Gun violence spikes in NYC”; “Multiple Weekend Shootings Continue Citywide Spike In Gun Violence”; and incredibly, “[NYC Mayor] de Blasio confirms HE’LL CUT $1B from NYPD budget.” Is de Blasio out of his mind?
Our local law enforcement needs MORE support as they risk their lives to protect our communities from these out-of-control mobs -- not LESS.
Giving into the radical “defund the police” movement only helps one group -- criminals.
Our police officers are under ATTACK, Alex, and that’s why it’s CRITICAL they know we have their backs. So I’m asking you to take a stand and sign our Back the Blue petition right now.
Back the Blue
Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York City Council members seem to believe the NYPD only goes after purse-snatchers and teenagers with fireworks. In reality, police officers have thwarted terrorist attacks, mass shootings, and violent crimes -- and saved countless innocent lives.
Let’s give our law enforcement our full support. Sign our petition today!
Thank you and a special thank you to those who continue to protect our communities,

MAKE A DIFFERENCE
Nancy Goroff calls police “dangerous.” She supports a bill that would enact cashless bail nationally and implement a massive prison release, including violent criminals like MS-13 gang members. Goroff has also refused to condemn the looting and violence against cops and believes that non-police should be sent to domestic violence crime scenes, instead of sending police.

1\. She called our brave law enforcement officers ""dangerous""[[URL REDACTED]]’s on video.
2\. She proposed “moving funding” and sending in non-police to respond to domestic violence crime scenes instead of sending [[URL REDACTED]]’s on video.
3\. She criticized riot gear being given to police to respond to riots...everyone has seen the picture.
4\. She refused to condemn looting, rioting, and violence against police during her law enforcement [[URL REDACTED]] is well documented by the Suffolk PBA.
5\. She supported a bill that would enact cashless bail nationally. It also contained a massive prison release, including violent [[URL REDACTED]] wrote an op-ed about her support for the bill and posted her support on Twitter.
6\. In a democratic primary debate, she was the only candidate on stage who would not commit to supporting federal funding to combat [[URL REDACTED]] on video.
No need to take my word on any of this. See the videos, pics, etc. for yourself at [[URL REDACTED]] I unapologetically support our men and women in blue and there is a zero percent chance my opponent is getting anything close to a free pass for her anti-police agenda.

Team Zeldin's New TV Ad
Amy Thomas is the Assistant Chief of the South Country Ambulance Company in Brookhaven. In our campaign's new TV ad, ""It's Personal"", Amy talks about the many ways I was delivering for our front line medical workers from the first moment the coronavirus pandemic reached Long Island earlier this year. Working with individuals at all levels of government and on both sides of the aisle, I secured over 1.2 million items of PPE in one month alone at the height of the pandemic, thousands of ventilators for New York, testing, funding, and more. My attitude then is the same as my attitude today that we should approach this pandemic not as Republicans First or Democrats First, but as Americans First and Long Islanders First. Thank you Amy for your amazing support and everything you do to serve our community! Watch the new TV ad first here.

Alex,
Right here in NY-01, our opponent said she supports defunding our police. That’s a dangerous precedent to set.
While crimes are skyrocketing, our opponent and her fellow out-of-control radicals are working to defund our police officers. They have labeled our district a TOP TARGET because they know how important it is to win in 2020.
That’s why your support is so crucial. We must end the mob rule and restore law and order to our cities, but we need your help >>>
Our end-of-month fundraising deadline ends TONIGHT at MIDNIGHT. Lee created the Restore NY Values Fund because our values are under attack by the radical left that seeks to burn and pillage cities.
ALL GIFTS 3X MATCHED
Stand with Lee
This is the biggest race in the country, and we’re working hard to build the momentum to take on our far left opponent in less than 100 days.
Show Lee that he has your support BEFORE MIDNIGHT >>>
Hurry! Our deadline is HOURS away, and Long Island needs a fighter like Lee in Washington.

Alex,
The Senate impeachment trial started this week and Lee is working hard to defend the President against this sham impeachment. The articles of impeachment don’t even allege a crime!
The Democrat elite have made it clear that they are willing to silence the votes of 63 million Americans in their effort to take down our President --- and we know these extremists won’t stop there.
Now, NY Democrats have made Lee their TOP-TARGET for 2020, because he is fighting to defend our President and protect our district from their radical socialist agenda.
That’s why Lee Zeldin and President Trump need your support now to help fight back these ridiculous attacks.

Alex,
As we heard during this week's Republican National Convention, this November's election is the most important election of our lifetimes. Our nation is at a crossroads, and it's up to us to determine what kind of a country we have come January 2021.
Especially after witnessing riots in US city streets, calls to defund our amazing police, and flawed policies like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, it’s more important than ever for you and I to successfully fight for freedom, security, prosperity and greatness for America.
I need your urgent support today to hit my end of month fundraising deadline! [[URL REDACTED]]
I’m running against a far left Democrat who calls our police “dangerous” and even questioned their need for essential protective equipment.
Alternate text
Not only would a vote for the radical left mean a vote for socialized universal healthcare, cashless bail, free college and healthcare for illegal immigrants paid for by American tax dollars, requiring even higher taxes -- it would be a vote for a more dangerous New York.
Mayor de Blasio’s extreme policies and feckless leadership have forced more and more of New York’s law enforcement officers to get injured or retire early. Alex, this is extremely dangerous, especially since crime in New York has SKYROCKETED in the past few months. The far left wants to bring policies like de Blasio’s to Long Island.
It’s up to you now, Alex! Every dollar you donate will go towards fighting back against these policies.
Our August end-of-month fundraising deadline is coming up on Monday, and we’re $21,750 behind our goal. To help us get there, we are launching our Stop Radical Nancy Fund to take back the House. Help us reach our goal and Stop Nancy’s dangerous agenda from taking over our district and country.

Alex,
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris made it crystal clear -- they fully support cashless bail. Harris specifically pushed cashless bail at this week’s Vice Presidential debate. Last week, House Democrats passed a bill enacting cashless bail nationally. Biden’s website brags that “Biden will lead a national effort to end cash bail.”
Here in NY, we’ve seen exactly how big of a disaster cashless bail has been. Criminals have been arrested, released on bail, and then arrested again on new crimes instantly. Oftentimes, they are arrested just HOURS or DAYS later. We’ve seen COUNTLESS examples of these types of DANGEROUS scenarios as a result of cashless bail. Help us fight back TODAY >>>
Kamala Harris was one of the original architects of cashless bail in California. Now she’s ready to take over the White House and expand cashless bail to the rest of the country. This is the most important election of our lifetimes -- losing is not an option. We MUST FIGHT BACK . . . and protect our cities.

Immediately following our campaign's release of its first digital ad for our race to unseat Representative Nadler, we noticed widespread Google News manipulation with thinly-veiled death threats on local news sites owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group.
Hundreds of articles with headlines such as ""Man goes to clear out dead mom's home, find's body in freezer,"" ""Trucker charged in serial killings faces scrutiny across US,"" ""Linda Tripp, whistleblower in Clinton-Lewinsky sex scandal, dies at 70,"" and ""Top NYC doctor, shaken after treating coronavirus patients, commits suicide,"" were improperly configured to be indexed by Google's search engine with: ""Attorney Jeff Kurzon, representing Yang and Congressional Candidate Jonathan Herzog...""
A Harvard computer science expert determined that such indexing manipulation could only require the technical capability of a higher schooler. Sinclair Broadcast Group and Google did not respond.

Finally, Light on the Horizon
Dear Supporter,
Across America, we are collectively navigating uncharted territory during this global pandemic. Our economy has taken a significant downturn, and many small businesses are struggling to stay afloat. I am remaining laser focused on solutions that work toward responsibly re-opening our economy while ensuring safety for our workers who are the backbone of our economic engine.
On Thursday, I was pleased to support bipartisan legislation that provided additional emergency funding for small businesses, more relief for hospitals and our health care heroes on the front lines, and increased testing to keep Americans safe. It was disappointing that small businesses were forced to wait two full weeks until  Speaker Pelosi abandoned her socialist policy demands, including the Green New Deal and a federal takeover of elections. Finally, much-needed relief is on the way.
There is light on the horizon and I am optimistic that when we come out of this, we will be a stronger, more resilient, self-reliant nation where the American dream is available for all who want to pursue it.
Biden’s Record on the 2nd Amendment
Now that national Democrats have chosen Joe Biden as their presidential candidate, we are starting to learn more about the policies he supports. As a former law enforcement officer and victim of two violent gun crimes, I am committed to preserving our 2nd Amendment rights. I am concerned about Biden’s gun-control policies, which would weaken the constitutional right of law-abiding citizens. According to news reports, ""Biden has supported a wide range of new gun-control measures during his 2020 campaign for president:
* In June, he pushed for a ban on sales of all guns except hypothetical 'smart guns.'
* In October, he said he would support a national registry of firearms 'down the line.'
* In March, he threatened to fight an autoworker, who challenged his support for bans on guns like the AR-15.
* A short time later, he brought on a new campaign manager, who publicly supported confiscating AR-15s.""
I am proud of my record on protecting and preserving the 2nd Amendment, and I will continue supporting your inalienable right to keep and bear arms.
Humbly Seeking Your Endorsement
While none of us could have imagined the ""virtual"" world we currently live in due to the governor’s stay-at-home orders, I look forward to visiting with delegates this Friday evening at the 8th Congressional District Republican virtual convention. I look forward to sharing with delegates our vision of freedom, hope, and prosperity; my plans to continue fighting for our way of life; and an optimistic, helpful reminder that – through good times and bad – we continue to live in the greatest country in the world. If you are an 8th District delegate, I look forward to seeing you online on Friday night as I humbly seek your endorsement.
Have a great week!
Sincerely,

My opponent is exactly what’s wrong with our broken system. He’s a rubber stamp for the Trump Administration and stands for corporate special interests — not everyday people, like you and me.
He’s voted to strip healthcare away from the most vulnerable in Arkansas. He’s voted to excuse Donald Trump’s blatant corruption and crimes. He’s even voted against critical relief funding during the worst pandemic in a century.
He’s simply too extreme for Northwest Arkansas.
But we can’t defeat him if we don’t put in the hard work. We can’t just plan on voting — we have to step up.
My team tells me we need another 1,459 donations before the weekend — can I count you in for a donation right now?

# Ward condemns Gosar statement
On 18 June, Anne Marie Ward condemned Paul Gosar’s recent attack on law enforcement. Gosar was quoted in the Payson Roundup as saying that, “[t]he police in this country have lost the support of millions of Americans who do not trust their judgment. From the murder of Mr. Floyd to harassing suburban moms in a park, or old people on a beach, law enforcement has created a trust problem for themselves.”
Anne Marie sharply criticized Gosar’s statement. “Paul should apologize to his constituents and to all law enforcement officers in Arizona. This is totally inappropriate for a member of Congress to say in ANY context. Unlike my opponent, I fully support our brave police officers. AZ04 loves our men and women in blue (Paul, you might know this if you actually lived in the district you pretend to represent)!”
Ward has distinguished herself from Gosar in her strong support of law enforcement, pointing to Gosar’s votes against 9/11 first responders and against making it a federal crime to commit a targeted attack on law enforcement.
Ward has been a vocal supporter of law enforcement. On 13 June, she posted a photo on social media that was widely shared across the district, expressing her support of police officers. Three days later, a campaign sign of hers was vandalized with the acronym, “ACAB” (All Cops are Bastards). Ward responded on social media by again offering her full support to law enforcement and by calling for civility. She posted on 17 June: “We cannot make positive change in this country by using hateful and derogatory language, whether racially driven or by the profession which someone pursues ... there is far more that unites us in this country than divides us. We can no longer allow career politicians to use tragedies like this to break our nation into rivaling factions for their own political gain.”
In light of Gosar’s critical statement on law enforcement, Ward further stated on 18 June: “Paul Gosar’s comment lumps the entire profession of law enforcement into a category of bad actors who do not deserve our trust. I can’t overstate how damaging this is. We deserve better from our representative.” The primary faceoff between Ward and Gosar — who resides outside the district — is on Aug. 4, 2020.
Anne Marie Ward is a Republican candidate for U.S. Congress in AZ-04.

My entire life, Democrats have always been the “nice” ones -- the ones who were worried about what Fox News or Republican attack ads would say about them.
I decided to run for Congress because after watching from the sidelines for years, I realized the Dems would never learn. They don’t know how to fight. But I do.
Today, Democrats will vote to impeach the most corrupt president in the history of our country. Congratulations. Anyone with two eyes and a brain knew he was a walking impeachment offense.
It’s an impeachment of his own making. He colluded with the Russians to rig an election in 2016, then bribed the Ukrainians to do the same in 2020. He’s a criminal who deserves to go to jail, not an early retirement at Mar-a-Lago.
If you’re looking for a Democrat who will go to Congress to get along with the party establishment, I have a list of candidates you should consider. I will not be that Congressman.
If I’m elected to Congress, I will raise hell like it’s never been raised before. I’ll call out the Republicans (and Democrats when they deserve it) for their bribery and their crimes. And if Donald Trump is still in office, I’ll hold his feet to the fire every single day.
If you agree that we need a fighter in Congress, I need your help. Please donate what you can to send a message that we can do better than this joke of a president and his enabling Congress.

Alex,
The truth can't be ignored anymore – Nancy Pelosi and her House Democrats have become a dangerous threat to the rule of law!
By introducing their Articles of Impeachment, the Demcorats have launched an unprecedented and indiscriminate assault on President Trump with no regard to the Constitution.
The Democrats aren't waiting, they're hitting the gas on impeachment and we're struggling to keep pace. Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff have weaponized the impeachment process for their own hyper-partisan political goals and have even focus-grouped which crimes will appeal the most to voters!
Alex, I need your immediate support if I'm ever going to keep up with the Democrats' non-stop assault on the President and our nation. Please rush over $15, $20, $25 or even more to defend President Trump.
RUSH OVER $15 NOW
RUSH OVER $20 NOW
RUSH OVER $25 NOW
RUSH OVER EVEN MORE NOW
The Democrats will not let 2016 go and now they're tearing the country apart and shredding the Constitution along the way. The very foundation of our nation is at stake today.
Will you stand with me, and help me take on the Democrats' gross abuse of power by rushing over a quick donation right away?
Sincerely,
Ken

Platform
Putting America First:If this isn't the goal of any American politician, then one must ask whose side they are on. We must put Americans first. On a political level, it's treason not to.
Trade: It needs to be reciprocal and with our allies. We should not support countries that violate human rights or steal our Intellectual Property. We must put the lives of all humans and our citizens first.
Border Security: Americans have the right to protect their borders. I completely support Trump's initiative to build the wall. I would support funding to ensure the wall is finished in an expedited and timely manner. Boats and small aircraft are currently coming into the country without accountability to who and what is being transported. I would support stronger border security on the water and in the air.
Wall Street: Any company trading on Wall Street needs to offer the same full disclosure as American companies. If a company refuses to open its books then the SEC should not allow such a company to trade in the US markets. We must protect the integrity of our financial markets, which in turn protects the IRAs and pension plans of American citizens.
Education: Knowledge is power. We must focus on a solid education for each citizen. I support Charter Schools and home schooling. I believe the Constitution should be taught in elementary school and a Civics class should be mandatory for graduation from middle school or high school for a public school to be eligible for federal funding.
Israel: The embassy should have been moved to Jerusalem years ago. President Trump has taken many appropriate steps in improving our relations with Israel. I support the efforts the Trump Administration has taken and the direction of US policy regarding Israel since Trump has been in office.
Gun Rights: ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" We do not want to be in situation such as that in Venezuela or Hong Kong. Guns in the hands of the people is essential. American citizens have the right to protect and defend themselves and their property.
Off-Shore Drilling: I am against it.
Wind and Solar: Can become an integral energy source allowing homeowners to go off-grid to protect against overloading the system and decreasing personal reliance upon electrical grids. The goal is to increase personal freedom and protection.
Health Care: It needs to benefit citizens over corporations and big business. Person choice in health care providers supports an American's right to personal freedom and liberty.
Opioid Crisis: We must continue to fix this devastating problem that has gripped so many through both street drugs and big pharma. We do not have a the right to support regimes that allow drugs to cross into our borders.
Fentanyl: If a country is targeting Americans with Fentanyl, that country has pitted itself against our country and our people. We must not support the economy of any country set out to destroy ours.
Visas for Tech Workers: The visa system has been abused. We need to hire Americans for our most sought after and best paying tech jobs. There are plenty of Americans over 40 and American women who are well qualified but overlooked due to their age or sex. Hire Americans first. There is no shortage of qualified American tech workers. Ageism in tech needs to end.
Immigration: We must respect the planet and the harms to our water supply and air supply that come with over-population issues. Our country is not short on people. Its time to balance the population with environmental concerns.
Monopolistic Tech Companies: Once they are traded on Wall Street, these corporations (Google, Facebook, Apple, Twitter, etc) are no longer private companies. The fact that they are traded publicly makes them public companies. They are bound by the rules of our country, yet they are in ways that harm our financial and economic structure and continually violate our laws and constitution. Monopolies are illegal. We must protect innovation, creativity, the US economy, free enterprise, small businesses and entrepreneurs, and the structural foundations of business and innovation that make this country great.
Governmental Corruption: Enough is enough. Let's help Trump drain the swamp!
SpaceForce: There is a need to protect our Country's interests in space. American satellites are part of our American infrastructure and national security. It is the government's job to ensure these assets are protected. In recent years, the military has acknowledged several unidentified aircraft that function in manners that common aircraft does not. It is important that we acknowledge, address and learn more about the world around us.
The Federal Reserve: President Trump and others are right to question the US relationship with the Federal Reserve. It is not owned by the U.S. Government. It is a private entity. The U.S. pays 2% for each dollar lent by the Federal Reserve. As a nation, we must look at whether or not this is a rational decision in the best interest of the United States, or if it serves the interests of just a few, and whether or not those interests are in conflict with the interests of our citizens and national security.
The Wall: Before President Trump announced his pledge to build the wall, Democrats openly and commonly addressed the need for increased national security on the Southern Border. Putting politics before the welfare of our country might serve a few self-interested politicians and elites but it does not serve American citizens and does not secure our people.
Intellectual Property Theft: There is no rational justification to do business with a government or company that has, or has attempted, to steal intellectual property from the US government, US Citizen, or US Company. This crime threatens US national security and our economic security. It must not go unpunished.
Taxing Tech Companies: A tech company is just like any other company and should be taxed just like any other company. Initially, tech companies were not taxed as an incentive program to encourage online businesses. That was 30+ years ago. It's time to tax them. Those tax dollars are needed to support our infrastructure, education, military, small business growth and a multitude of other projects. The tax dollars could also be used to pay down the deficit!
FISA: For three letter agencies (CIA, DOJ, Etc) to feel entitled to spy on a candidate and/or President of the United States implies the agencies have a long history of using FISA warrants to spy on individuals who they have no right to surveil. Otherwise, these nefarious players would not have felt so at ease and bold about illegally surveilling a candidate and president. I would support of full investigation into who is being surveilled through the use of FISA warrants and the legality of the surveillance. If there is corruption within the department, it needs to be exposed and eliminated.

# In Case Anyone Still Wants to Defund the Police…
July 7, 2020
Our Voice
Welcome to “Our Voice,” a brief 90-second review of the week featuring updates from our campaign and a look at the latest conservative news.
In Case Anyone Still Wants to Defund the Police…
The leftist mob wants you to believe defunding the police will help lead to equal justice. Newsflash, it doesn’t. Here is the reform we need to discuss: The violence and crime rate of cities with Democratic leaders. 77 people were shot just this past weekend in Chicago, 12 of them being under the age of 18. We see “Justice for George Floyd” plastered all over social media, but what about “Justice for Natalia Wallace?” Natalia Wallace, a sweet, 7-year-old child, was shot and killed the evening of July Fourth while playing outside with friends. No child should ever have to worry about being shot and killed while playing outside.
My heart absolutely breaks for Natalia Wallace, and other children like her who have suffered the same fate. We need to see real action come of these lawless acts of hatred and recklessness within our American cities. This needs to start with local leadership. Without well trained law enforcement, who follow proper procedures, we would only see crime rates across our country skyrocket. When will the left realize all the police are not the problem?

Let Our Children go Back to School 🚨
With all the coronavirus back and forth nowadays, one question still remains: Will our children be able to go back to school in the fall? President Trump has voiced his support for schools reopening in the fall, while national Democrats are declining to take a stand either way.
It is no secret our children need to go back to school. Unfortunately, the left is afraid to agree with this fact because it doesn’t fit their “destroy Trump” narrative. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) expressed their concerns with students not returning to the classroom this fall. Virtual classrooms not only hinder a child’s educational experience, but also affect their social skills and the irreplaceable lessons they learn within the classroom. We can find a way to keep our teachers and children safe while still having them learn.

# Chaos on the Left ⬅️ Prosperity on the Right ➡️
June 12, 2020
Our Voice
Welcome to “Our Voice,” a brief 90-second review of the week featuring updates from our campaign and a look at the latest conservative news.
Chaos on the Left ⬅️ Prosperity on the Right ➡️
Support law enforcement graphic Eric Esshaki
Leading Democrats, including Representative Haley Stevens, refuse to denounce the chaos spreading. We all want justice, but we also want our rights to be protected. When businesses had their warehouses burned during the riots, their rights were not protected. And when store owners had merchandise looted from their stores, their rights were not protected either.
Even so, Haley Stevens refuses to denounce crazy ideas like defunding the police. Stevens' ally, Governor Whitmer, has even alluded to supporting the movement. This idea is not only preposterous, it's also dangerous. Research shows that in areas where police minimized contact with civilians following riots, crime and homicides increased.
You can grieve for George Floyd and want to hold bad police accountable, and still support law enforcement. Americans want fairness, justice and safety FOR ALL. The left-wing politicians want us to choose one or the other.
Ironically, while the left supports sabotaging our streets, President Trump is managing to restore our economy. In May, unemployment dropped and 2.5 million jobs were added. We have chaos and lawlessness on the left, and peace and prosperity on the right. Come November, we will show which side we support.

The Hypocrisy is Infuriating 😠
Remember when Gov. Whitmer stripped us of our basic constitutional rights in the name of social distancing? It seems there is a double standard when liberals want to enact their agenda. This week, Gov. Whitmer violated her own social distancing guidelines to attend a protest. Photos show her within six feet of other protestors, in direct violation of her own website’s recommendations.
The barber who had his license stripped for opening during the lockdown is likely feeling very frustrated right now. The same could be said for the hundreds of other small business owners struggling to make ends meet. Gov. Whitmer said that elections matter. On that, Gov. Whitmer, we agree. We need more leaders who put people before their own agenda.

# Constitutional Rights Matter - Even in Times of Crisis ✅
May 30, 2020
Our Voice
Welcome to “Our Voice.” A brief 90 second review of the week that features updates from our campaign and a look at the latest conservative news.
Constitutional Rights Matter - Even in Times of Crisis ✅
This week, I discussed the issues that matter to us on Bill Mitchell’s show Campaign Corner. We covered everything from our successful lawsuit against Governor Whitmer, to what inspired me to run for Congress in the first place. It all comes down to my respect for our Constitution and the need to revert to it regardless of the circumstance.
Our triple win against liberal Governor Whitmer demonstrated even in times of crisis, constitutional rights still matter. Opening up the economy, while ensuring the well being of those at risk, is an important step in protecting our rights to work and support our families. My opponent, Congresswoman Haley Stevens does not respect these values. Her record of voting with Nancy Pelosi 100% of the time shows she supports big government and minimizing our liberties. We need to revert to conservative principles of hard work, not handouts. It’s time for a change.

This is Why Democrats Want to Extend Lockdown 😠
Jason Furman, one of former President Barack Obama's top economic advisers, gave a presentation to top Democratic strategists and donors last month, during which he shared “some of the best economic data in the history of the country.” The crowd was shocked and thought he had misspoken.
As President Trump pushes to reopen, advisers to Joe Biden are concerned that a bounce back in the economy could take away a weapon they planned to use against President Trump. “This is my big worry,” one former adviser to Obama told POLITICO. Americans are aware it’s the President’s removal of regulations and taxes that brought about measures such as the lowest unemployment rate in half a century and it is these same policies that will bring our economy back to where it needs to be.

Friend —
This morning, House and Senate Democrats announced a new bill that could bring transformative change in policing. I am proud to join the Congressional Black Caucus, the House Judiciary Committee, and Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris in helping introduce this critical piece of legislation.
Now, I am calling on Mitch McConnell to allow this bill to the floor for a vote. But, I need your help to send a powerful message to Washington. Can you sign my petition to demand this bill gets heard on the Senate floor?
SIGN MY PETITION
Our work is to root out the culture of racism and abuse of power at the heart of a system that allows the Black community and so many other marginalized communities to be killed, abused, and harassed by law enforcement over and over again.
The bill includes the following changes to police policy:
* Create a federal registry for police misconduct and require states to report use of force to the Department of Justice;
* Ban chokeholds and carotid holds and only allocate funding to state and local jurisdictions that end these practices;
* End the use of “no-knock” warrants that often lead to deadly use of force by officers and make funding contingent on ending the use of these warrants;
* Give state attorneys general the power to hold police accountable for eliminating the culture of racism and violence in their departments, and to conduct independent investigations of the use of force;
* Enact mandatory racial and implicit bias training for police officers and condition federal funding to departments based on them providing this training;
* Strictly limit the transfer of military-grade weaponry to police departments;
* Make lynching a federal hate crime;
* And changes “qualified immunity” to make it easier for people to be able to sue police officers for civil rights violations.
The Justice in Policing Act of 2020 is a good and important start in enacting much-needed change to federal policy around policing. We need to pass this legislation in both the House and the Senate — and we’ll need your help to do so.
The protests of the last few weeks have made it clear that Americans are demanding change and accountability now. Can you make your voice heard and sign my petition right now? It is so important.
SIGN MY PETITION
I know this bill is just the beginning. But I think it’s a very important first step. We have a lot of work to do, and I am more committed than ever to this fight.
Thank you for consistently taking action. I am proud to have you on this team.

Last year was the deadliest year on record for mass shootings in the United States. So far, more people have died from gun violence this year than in the same time period in years previous. As we all face a global pandemic and many Americans stockpile essential household items, some are stockpiling something incredibly dangerous: guns.
Despite stay-at-home orders and decreasing crime rates, shootings have surged in cities across the country. It's clear that the coronavirus pandemic won’t erase our nation’s gun violence crisis, and in some ways, it could make it worse. Even as Americans continue to stay home during this pandemic, they're confronting gunfire from domestic violence incidents, injuries from improperly stored firearms, and suicide.
For too long, gun lobbyists and leaders who refuse to take common-sense steps have blocked the necessary change and legislation to save lives. Federal laws are full of loopholes and are poorly enforced, so even a basic background check is easily avoided. The gun lobby has long tried to stir up fear and scare individuals into buying more guns. But buying into the gun lobby’s fear-based worldview will only weaken public health and safety during this unprecedented time. Panic buying guns won’t make us safer. The reality is that more guns will translate into more gun violence.
The only way to protect our communities is to take immediate action to end gun violence.
David Buchwald knows that we need bold policy and advocacy to address the root of the problem, end gun violence, and build safe communities. That’s why he co-sponsored the New York SAFE Act, the strongest gun safety law in the country, and wants to pass a national SAFE Act in Congress. We need people like David in Washington who are going to prioritize gun control legislation to protect our communities and end the epidemic of gun violence in our nation. Common-sense gun safety reform is about saving lives.
Best,
Matt

We hope you are doing well and staying safe during these challenging times. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve each day, and we know that much uncertainty still lies ahead. Team Buchwald is now working remotely, and we encourage all those who are able to practice social distancing. We've canceled all in-person fundraising for the time being and have transitioned to communicating with voters virtually while maintaining the social distancing that epidemiologists and doctors tell us is vital for slowing the spread of this disease. Our commitment to you remains the same, and we look forward to the day that we can all gather together to celebrate in person our common values and shared visions for the future.

To make matters worse, there’s a bipartisan bill in the U.S. Senate right now that would make this happen, but it’s being held up by petty partisan politics.
The bill was passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the House in February. Now we need the Senate to follow their lead. Add your name today to help urge the Senate to pass this vital legislation so we can make lynching a federal hate crime.
SIGN THE PETITION
The Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act is named in honor of Emmett Till, a young Black boy who was brutally murdered in Money, Mississippi in 1955. Emmett was visiting Mississippi from Chicago for the summer, and was accused of whistling at a white woman in a store. Till was taken from his home by a mob in the night and brutally beaten and thrown in a river.
His body was so mutilated that it was recommended that his casket remain closed for the service. Our family business, Century Funeral Home, helped transport Emmett’s body back to Chicago. Despite recommendations against showing Emmett’s body, his mother, Mamie Till, decided she wanted the world to see what those men did to her son. Emmett Till’s open casket made the front page of newspapers across the world, but even that didn’t help his family see justice delivered. His killers were never found guilty.
We need the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act to become law so we can make sure no other family has to live knowing that justice wasn’t served for the racially-motivated killing of their loved one. Please add your name today so we can help make this a reality.
SIGN THE PETITION
2020 isn’t over yet, and we have already experienced headlines, videos, and live footage of racial violence. Making lynching a federal crime is still a necessity today. We must do everything possible to protect the lives of everyone and help make sure no one in this country feels unsafe.
Thanks for all you do.

Change is happening not just here in Mississippi, but in states all across the South. In South Carolina and Georgia, my fellow Black Democratic candidates Jaime Harrison and Rev. Raphael Warnock are also running people-powered campaigns for the U.S. Senate.
The November election is our chance to elect bold new leaders in the South to take our country forward. That’s why my brothers and I wrote an op-ed for BET sharing our vision for a New South, and I wanted to make sure you saw it.
But first, real quick, is there any chance you can chip in just $10 to our campaign to help us win in Mississippi and build a New South together?
In the Deep South, recent calls for equality and equity in the way our law enforcement treats American citizens have ricocheted from state to state — from the quiet streets of rural towns like Loganville, Georgia and Petal, Mississippi, to the glittering metropolises that drive our Southern economies.
These watershed moments of public outcry are a sign of people feeling unheard and underrepresented, and decisions our leaders make today can have wide-ranging impacts on the lived experiences of Black Americans. For the first time in history, we’re seeing people in all 50 states stand together to protest the racial injustices that have become all too common in our country.
Representation matters. And for its entire history, the United States Senate has failed to represent the racial diversity of our nation. This is particularly notable for states in the Deep South, which feature some of the largest Black populations in the United States. Yet since Reconstruction, the Deep South has only sent one African-American to the United States Senate.
Our same states, the ones we call home, have a long history of sordid racial legacies. We know it all too well as men who grew up under laws designed to keep people like us from having a seat at the table. Those public policies for decades have either forgotten Black communities or willfully ignored them. Schools in African-American areas are underfunded, and communities of color are at higher risk to have dilapidated infrastructure, like water systems across the rural Deep South with high lead levels.
Gone are poll taxes and grandfather clauses, but voting rights continue to be under attack in far more secretive, subversive ways like Voter ID laws. Black Americans in the South are punished with harsher sentences compared to white Americans, who commit the same crime. Look no further than the coronavirus pandemic to see this inequality in full form. Hospitalization rates for Black Americans with COVID are five times the rate of white Americans sick with the virus.
But, at this pivotal moment in our nation, we have the unique opportunity before us to turn momentum into results — to turn chants on the streets into laws on the books.
Our campaigns represent the rising of a New South that is bold, inclusive, and forward-looking. The kind of South — and a Deep South in particular — that can move past the darkest chapters of our history and look towards a future that leaves nobody behind. To deliver this change, we need to change who represents us.
You can help change who represents the people of Mississippi in the U.S. Senate this November: Make a contribution of $10 or whatever you can to support me in my race to replace Cindy Hyde-Smith and usher in a new era for the Magnolia State and the South as a whole.

I wanted to take a moment today to honor Medgar Evers, one of Mississippi's fiercest champions of justice. He was assassinated in his driveway 57 years ago today by a white supremacist.
Evers was the Mississippi NAACP State Conference’s first field secretary. In this position, Medgar traveled across the state to local NAACP branches helping to fight racial descrimination and injustice because of Jim Crow laws in Mississippi. He investigated lynchings, recorded hate crimes, and recruited Mississippians to the NAACP. This was an extremely dangerous job to have at the time, but Medgar persisted.
Medgar Evers
Medgar was mentored by T.R.M Howard, who was president of the Regional Council of Negro Leadership in (RCNL) in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. Here, he was trained in activism, and as an insurance salesman he was able to travel across the state and witness injustice against Black Mississippians.
Medgar helped to plan and execute many boycotts against white merchants who discriminated against Black patrons. He was influential in James Meredith's integration of the University of Mississippi. Evers himself tried to integrate the University of Mississippi Law school in 1954, but was shut out.
He was a supporter of student activism and assisted in student-led sit-ins across the state, and in the City of Jackson (where his office is still located). And that office is still used today by the current executive director of the Mississippi NAACP State Conference.
Medgar was a war veteran, had three children, and was married to his college classmate, Myrlie. Myrlie Evers-Williams is a civil rights icon in her own right, and I am deeply grateful to call her a friend.
Medgar Evers is a true Mississippi hero. We still feel his loss today, but his legacy lives on in all of us fighting for a new Mississippi.
Thanks for all you do.

I’ve spent the past couple weeks listening, reflecting, and participating in the peaceful protests calling for an end to police brutality against Black Americans here in Jackson.
This subject weighs heavily on my mind and heart, and I wanted to take a few minutes to share my thoughts with you about what reforms I believe are needed in order to effect change and truly ensure that Black Lives Matter within our criminal justice system and society as a whole.
Before I share my thoughts, I want to ask: Will you join me in the call for police reform by adding your name alongside mine today?
ADD YOUR NAME
My brother-in-law is an African-American cop who patrols a New Orleans suburban community. He speaks to me often of his perilous duty. He has encountered most of the difficulties and challenges inherent in being a law enforcement officer in today’s America.
But as a Black man, he understands the sordid history of hate and violence in this country that has been disproportionately directed at Black Americans. To be sure, he has read about and reflected on the recent tragedies of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and the countless others over the course of years. And he is acutely and painfully aware that centuries of racial bias continue to contribute to the worst outcomes in encounters with many law enforcement officers across our country.
What happened to George Floyd is an abomination. Four Minneapolis policemen used excessive force to cause his death in what appears to be a tragically cavalier fashion. All four officers involved should be held fully accountable and incarcerated for their crimes.
The public outcry generated by the horribly graphic video of Floyd’s death quickly became international in scope, eclipsing even the global pandemic. The call for changes to our established policing structure has perhaps never been more forceful.
So, what are we to do now that we have reached this inflection point? How do we make sure that we have more officers who value Black life and where the numerous episodes of tragic and obvious police misconduct will no longer occur?
I believe there are a number of clear steps.
First, we need to hire more officers of color, especially Black men and women. We can attract more applicants by offering competitive salaries and opportunities for continuing education.
Second, applicants and new hires should be subject to stringent background checks on past conduct and previous performance. Greater transparency is the easiest and simplest solution to prevent officers who have previously been in trouble from getting new jobs. That’s why we must create a national registry of police misconduct and disciplinary actions. State and local police departments should also be required to report use-of-force incidents to the Department of Justice.
Third, we must mandate bias and de-escalation training. I also want our police officers to receive training from our mental health counselors, social workers, child protection officers, and addiction specialists. On a daily basis, officers are confronted with situations involving these afflictions- some are violent, but many are not. We shouldn’t try to turn policemen into social workers, but they should at least understand that not all offenders belong in jail. Some may need mental health treatment, others may require referral to drug treatment, or other alternatives might be in order. I want our departments to work hand-in-hand with these experts so they can better understand these situations in order to better serve our communities.
Fourth, chokeholds and other restraint positions that can reduce blood and airflow should be abolished. We must create a new prevailing standard of conduct in which the unacceptable standard of “reasonable force” is replaced with “necessary force.”
Fifth, all officers in all locales should be required to wear body cameras and officers should be forbidden from turning them off while on duty.
I believe the opportunity for change is upon us — in Mississippi and across the nation. Young leaders have stepped up, and we more seasoned leaders must not step aside. We have to stay in the fight. That’s why I was proud to peacefully march last Saturday with the organizers of Black Lives Matters of Mississippi, alongside my wife and two sons.
And I would be even prouder to work with them from the halls of the U.S. Senate. We need leadership for this new age. Someone who will listen to everyone, who will show up to march for all the good and just causes — someone who will help to fuse the coalition of youthful passion with the judgment of those who have been around, and who have “seen some things.” We need someone who will work with everyone regardless of race, age, gender, religion or sexual orientation, and who can help set a positive course for Mississippians.
Dr. W.E.B. DuBois lamented that the central problem of the 20th century was “the color line.” Unfortunately, as we embark upon the third decade of the 21st century his assessment still holds true. But, working together we can change this. Through commitment, cooperation, and the enactment of no nonsense solutions, we can get to a place that works for all of us.
Join me in committing to the fight for justice and calling for these clear, necessary reforms to policing in America: Add your name now.

Friend,
Turncoat Jeff Van Drew is helping Trump raise money – but we need to remember that Donald Trump only keeps people close who publicly pledge their loyalty.
Jeff Van Drew didn’t earn this position because he’s a good Congressman or even because he’s a good fundraiser. He earned this spot because he continues to show Trump that he’ll do anything to stay in power. That’s the only quality Trump really respects.
It also means the Trump crime organization will be doing everything possible to keep Jeff Van Drew in Congress. They know that this seat is the most likely to flip from red-to-blue, so they’re going to dump in a lot of money and break any rule that gets in their way.
We need to be ready to fight back. Brigid is our best chance to flip this seat. That’s why she’s been endorsed by both of New Jersey’s Senators, the state’s largest newspaper, and dozens of elected officials, community leaders, and progressive organizations around the state. Can you help us fight against Trump’s political machine here in New Jersey?

**Original Message**
Friend,
It shouldn’t be much a surprise by this point, but Jeff Van Drew has been officially named as one of Trump’s top national fundraisers.
While New Jersey is struggling through this pandemic – a pandemic made worse by their inaction – they’re out cashing checks from billionaires, corporations, and anyone else who wants a favor from the Trump crime organization.
It’s tone-deaf, it’s slimy, and it’s a perfect fit for someone like Jeff Van Drew. He’s a practiced opportunist who will do whatever it takes to hold on to power – just like Donald Trump.
We believe there’s important work to do. If you agree, we need your support to elect Brigid Callahan Harrison and send Jeff Van Drew home. Remember, Cook’s Political Report called this seat “the most likely to flip” from red to blue. Please contribute whatever you’re able.

Friend,
Last Friday, the Senate voted to not allow witnesses or evidence in Trump’s trial, and today, the Senate is likely to acquit Trump.
Trump has been stacking Congress with his allies to help him get away with his crimes. Just ask his BFF, Jeff Van Drew, who voted no on the articles of impeachment, and just days later joined Trump in the Oval Office to announce his formal change of parties.

Team,
Tomorrow is the day. Donald Trump is coming to town to host a rally with his boy, Jeff Van Drew. Van Drew’s undying support of Trump and his involvement in helping Trump get away with his crimes continues to violate the trust of South Jersey. It is time for him to step aside and resign from office, as he has lost the confidence of those who voted for him.
Trump coming to Van Drew's district for rally on Jan. 28
So many of you have stepped up over the past couple of days to show that you are ready to take on Trump and his bestie this November, but it is not enough.
We will be going up against the biggest, dirtiest, and most vicious machines out there. We know we can win but only because of you all.
We are close to filling up the first part of our Defeat Trump’s Bestie Fund; while we will need a lot more, this will go a long way in sending a message to Trump and his boy that we aren’t messing around.

We can send a once-in-a-generation candidate to the Senate. His name is Adrian Perkins, and he could be the first Black senator from Louisiana.
Adrian is the grandson of sharecroppers who worked his way into West Point, where he was president of his class. In the Army, he then served multiple combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, and then, he went to Harvard Law School—where he was again president of his class.
Instead of working for a big-city law firm, Adrian returned to Louisiana and was elected mayor of his hometown. In his first year on the job, his hometown lowered crime and brought new jobs and economic opportunities for residents.
Now Adrian’s running for Senate, but his Republican opponent has a huge head start.

Adrian is running in a red state, so it’s going to take a huge effort to help him win. He’ll fight for us on key issues such as securing affordable healthcare and getting Americans relief from the economic downturn. And he’ll show Republicans that we can win in all areas of our country.

Since March, my campaign has been functioning entirely online to ensure the safety of our staff, volunteers, and community here on Long Island. As you can imagine, that makes building meaningful connections with voters challenging.
Our chances for conversation have been limited, but one way we've been keeping in touch and hearing from voters is by sending surveys with essay style questions.
If you have taken one of our surveys recently, thank you. I am so thankful that we have a tool that allows me to hear directly from you. In our last survey, we covered the partisan divide, misinformation, fearmongering, accountability, and issues that matter most to us individually.
There is still time to complete the survey if you missed it the last time around. You can add your thoughts here.
Additionally, I wanted to share some of the responses people shared with us regarding their worries, concerns, and top priorities. You can read a few of those below:
""Where to begin? COVID, kids in cages, BLM, gender pay gap, the economy, SALT, our standing on the world stage. Take your pick.""
""It is difficult to know where to start. Here is an alphabetical list: abortion rights; arms control; black lives matter; climate change; COVID-19; distribution of wealth; equity in education and everywhere; fascism; government failure; hate crimes; income inequality; judicial appointments; know-nothings; lawless officials, middle east chaos; ""never vaccinate"" people; open-pit mines; persecution of immigrants; quacks; Russian interference; systemic segregation; terrorism from within; untruths; vaccines; world peace; xenophobia; young people's future; Zuckerberg. And this off the top of my head, and is not at all exhaustive.""
""Right now, I'm exasperated at the number of people out there who refuse to wear masks both indoors and in enclosed places both outdoors and indoors when social distancing is all but impossible.""
""I am a recent college graduate. I went to SUNY Binghamton and have tens of thousands of dollars due in loans from the cost of room & board alone. With the coronavirus limiting the job market, I am incredibly worried about the future of my economic stability.""
""[We need to] Help those who are out of work due to the pandemic. Our family is fortunate enough to work from home without loss of income. Others are not so lucky. Let’s get the economy back in whatever safe way we can. Expand unemployment, provide health coverage for those in need. Then we can tackle other issues.""
As we look ahead, I want you to know that I hear your concerns \-- and I am grateful that so many of you used this space to be open and honest with me. Your continued input will help me become a better leader for our district while keeping me informed about the problems and issues most pressing to you personally.

Today, I’m bringing together the top leaders and advocates of New Jersey's cannabis community to talk about the impact prohibition has had on our economy, our judicial system, and our communities.
I stand with medical professionals, researchers, activists, and compassionate people all over our nation who know that we need to change course on marijuana.
Our nation’s outdated stance on marijuana results in 660,000 arrests and $3.6 billion in taxpayer costs every year. We’re wasting that money when it could be used to target violent crime, serial recidivists, and crimes that impact our most vulnerable neighbors. Even worse, we’re tearing families apart.
I released my full policy stance on cannabis because voters deserve to know where we stand. You can read it here.
If you agree that we should legalized, regulate, and tax marijuana, that we should expunge low-level offenses so our neighbors can get their lives back, and that it’s long past time for us to right this injustice, I need you on my team.

Team,
Last Friday, Trump fired Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, and Lt. Colonel Alex Vindman, the National Security Council’s top Ukraine expert, after they testified under a subpoena about Donald Trump’s decision to withhold military aid to Ukraine for political reasons. They told the truth under oath and were fired for it.
Make no mistake: Donald Trump fired these two impeachment witnesses to send a message he values loyalty to him over loyalty to the Constitution. I know what it’s like to be on the receiving end of these scare tactics. After I went on national television to sound the alarm on Russian interference in our election, House Republicans tried to silence me, going so far as to force me to testify that I hadn’t leaked any sensitive information about the Trump campaign.
These dangerous moves are intended to intimidate patriots and whistleblowers from speaking out against the crimes and corruption of this President and his Administration.
Enough is enough.
We need a Congress that will stand up to Trump and protect those who tell the truth.

# Happy New Year!
""It can be hard to put a year into words. A roller coaster of 365 days, some better than others. But it is important to reflect back before we set our sights forward to 2020 and beyond. For myself, 2019 was the most challenging year of my life, but also the most rewarding. There were times when I was left with many questions and few answers. But in those times there was only one decision to make. Collapse or keep pushing forward. This is a decision that many of us have to face on a daily basis and some days, when the walls are closing in, when you feel the pain of loss, the weight of debt or any of the burdens that many of us carry through this life, the choice is not easy. I’ve faced this decision many times in my young life. In business, in athletics, in relationships. But the only difference between myself and someone who has “failed” is that I chose to keep pushing forward. And if you’re struggling with this same decision, I’m here to tell you that there is strength inside of you. You may not feel it, but it’s there, it will see you through whatever trial you are currently facing and you will be even stronger tomorrow.
In 2019, my Non-Profit organization, Diamonds in the Rough, completed our first major project in Twinsburg Township. We were able to raise $160,000 to completely renovate the baseball field in their community park from a small patch of dirt and mud into a brand new beautiful ballpark. To see all of the smiling faces of The Twinsburg Heights community, as we unveiled the new ballpark, will forever be one of the proudest moments of my life and I cannot wait to see where my next project takes me. And as you know, in October I declared my candidacy to be Ohio’s 11th Congressional District’s Representative in the U.S. House. This decision was made after taking a hard look at my great District, which is among our Nation’s leaders in poverty, crime and lack of opportunity. I understood that a new wave of leaders needs to step up. Leaders that care deeply about individuals, who truly want to serve their community and who will fight for the very freedoms that make The United States the greatest Nation in the history of this earth. I have already spoken with hundreds of concerned voters across District 11 who feel abandoned by the democrat leadership that has failed them for 40 years. I cannot wait to hit the ground running in 2020 and carry my message of love, respect and individual freedom into the new decade.
Lastly, I would be remiss not to highlight some of the great strides our Country has made in 2019. Record low unemployment around our Nation including African Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Women. Median household income has hit its highest level ever recorded. First reduction in prescription drug costs in decades. Secured trade deals with Mexico and Canada as well as preliminary agreements with China. And most importantly, the average American is seeing more money in their paycheck. But despite living in possibly the best economy in world history and having relative peace abroad, we are still at each others throats. How can this be? What is driving our division? It feels that we have so little bringing us together. Few, if any, unifying beliefs or principles, along with the media and political leadership stoking the flames of division, has driven a wedge between us. If we are to move forward as a Nation, we must learn to love and respect one another regardless of our political affiliations. Only then will we find common ground.
I want to wish each and every one of you a Happy New Year and I pray God will bless your next decade with an abundance of joy!""
\- Jonah

694,"You are wanted, you are valued and I will fight for you.
Dear Alex,
My opponent is fueling hatred and peddling division during a time when we all need to be on the same team. This time against Asian-Americans.
I am often shocked by Congressman Balderson’s votes. Truly. They absolutely shock me.
Especially those who are bent on oppression of women and minorities. But a vote he made just yesterday takes the cake and has me once again wondering in disbelief “how could he vote against that?”
Yesterday our soon to be unemployed Congressman voted against a Resolution that would ensure protections against Asian-Americans from the dramatic spike of hate crimes against them.
The Resolution provides examples of the horrific spike in anti-Asian violence since COVID hit including the attack of a woman at a New York City subway, two children and two adults stabbed at a grocery store in Texas, and a 16-year-old boy sent to the hospital in California after an attack by bullies.
The Resolution also condemns the use of phrases like “Chinese Virus” or “Wuhan Virus” or “Kung Flu”.
House Resolution 908 also:
* Condemns all manifestations of expressions of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, anti-Asian sentiment, scapegoating, and ethnic or religious intolerance;
* Calls on Federal law enforcement officials, working with State and local officials— to expeditiously investigate and document all credible reports of hate crimes and incidents and threats against the Asian-American community in the United States.
* Recommits the United States leadership to build a more inclusive, diverse and tolerant society. Full resolution here.
Again, I ask … who votes against a resolution like this?
Troy Balderson does.
Balderson is telling us exactly who he is and with every vote he casts the picture becomes clearer. This man is one of the most conservative and far-right members of Congress who votes with Trump 95.6% of the time.
He is someone who does not want to grow, to change or to accept fault for any of his actions or, more accurately, inactions. He is someone who will always be looking backward, not forward. And he is definitely no leader.
Asian-Americans make up a large and growing part of our Ohio District. There is no doubt in my mind many of them are reading this Resolution right now and for them, I can’t even imagine the gut punch to see that their Congressman voted against it.
To them I say, please don’t let this discourage you.
The men and women who voted for this bill are protected by Gerrymandered Districts and they do not reflect the feelings of a majority of Ohioans. In fact, they represent a minority. But thanks to a rigged system they are in positions of power. Soon, however, very soon, at least one of them will be out of a job.
Hang in there, friends.
We want you here, we welcome you here. We know this virus is not your fault. In fact, we know this virus’ rampant spread across our country is due to our own leaders failing us and by no means tied to you.
You make our country more beautiful, more diverse and stronger simply because of your presence. Our home is now yours and I am proud to call you my sisters and brothers and my fellow Americans.
To Troy, you astonish me, you embarrass me as a constituent, and in just a few short weeks we’ll be putting an end to your cowardice.
If you want to help me put Troy Balderson out of a job then please consider a donation today.

695,"Enough is enough. It's time to throw them out.
It seems we are all hanging on by a thread, just trying to make sure the country we know and love has a fighting chance to survive.
So many things are hanging in the balance and it is hard not to feel completely overwhelmed.
Our health.
Our economy.
And now, our civil liberties.
As we battle multiple fronts as a nation, the President of the United States continues to lead without a plan and my opponent continues to obediently follow him. At all costs.
It’s like watching a slow-moving train wreck. And guys like Troy Balderson and Donald Trump are going to drive us off of a cliff.
This morning, Troy sent an email chastising protestors for breaking windows in Downtown Columbus. Yes, clearly, we can all agree broken windows are not okay, but you cannot equate that to the murder of an innocent black man by a police officer hired to protect him from violence. In order to prevent more senseless deaths, elected officials like Troy need to act.
For centuries, years, months and now days – our country's systemic racism has gone unanswered. We need solutions, we need peacemakers, we need bravery and courage to have tough conversations. But above all, we need action.
There are immediate steps, right now, that our legislators at the local, state and federal level can make to address violent crimes against communities of color. Here's one example: a federal law banning chokeholds or strangleholds. We can also invest far more time during police training on the de-escalation of violence. We must do better and equip our officers with the tools and knowledge they need to protect and preserve life. And last but not least, we must try and convict police officers who kill unarmed black men, women and children to the fullest extent of the law. Period. End of story.
This all must end now.
If you can give, here are just a few of the organizations that are working to support our communities of color: NAACP, Southern Poverty Law Center, and The Color of Change.
In the end, on November 4th, we will all wake up and know we did everything we possibly could when history laid down her challenge. And Troy Balderson will not be counted in that tally. He is sitting this one out, so let’s throw him out.

It’s now clear they are under investigation by the FBI -- this week Senator Burr was served with a warrant, had his cell phone seized and Apple was served a warrant for his iCloud.
Inhofe said it was all just a coincidence but the women and men who investigate these crimes say otherwise. We can hold Inhofe accountable for his corruption by voting him out of office.
Please make a recurring contribution of any amount to help us beat Inhofe!

697,"Greetings,
Here are 3 alarming facts about the Criminal Justice system in Oklahoma:
1. Oklahoma still has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world.
2. 20% of our inmates are housed in private for-profit prisons.
3. We are not seeing returns when it comes to public safety or inmate rehabilitation.
It's clear that we've built a system that is neither functioning nor sustainable, and it's time to stop pouring money into it.
As your Senator, I'll take a multi-pronged approach to fighting for a system that works. I'll advocate to reduce sentences for low-level drug crimes and invest in trauma-informed rehabilitation and mental health services.
Donate to my campaign today and be a part of the change!

698,"Dear Friends,
I often get asked what separates me from other candidates in this race.
The answer is simple: I have spent my entire life working and raising my family in CD 2 and Eastern Oregon.
I was born and raised here. I grew up working on my family’s ranch near Drewsey, went to college in La Grande and own, operate and live on a farm near Ontario. I have always voted as a resident of CD2.
Not only did I grow up here, but I developed a set of conservative values that were rare in Salem and even more rare in Washington DC.
I have always stood up for life & the unborn. I have been consistently supported by Oregon Right to Life in my previous elections. In fact, the last bill I asked be drafted in the Oregon Legislature was based upon a request from Oregon Right to Life.
The 2nd amendment is something I have never compromised on. It doesn't matter if you are riding fences or walking in downtown Portland, we all have the right to defend ourselves. When I helped lead the “Oregon 11” on the walkout that denied the super-majority democrats a quorum and killed the disastrous cap-and-trade bill, we also stopped the democrats’ all-out assault on our Second Amendment rights when we killed Senate Bill 978. If you recall, SB 978 would have imposed strict liability on those whose guns were stolen and used for a crime, among other provisions.
Water issues and policies are areas I am very familiar with and have worked on for more than half my life. President Trump also recognizes the importance of water to rural economies and communities. So when Governor Kate Brown advocates for removing the four lower Snake River dams, you bet I will push back against her Portland radical environmentalist agenda.
As we know in CD 2, the Pacific Northwest's intricate dam system is vital to the survival of our communities, our livelihoods and the transportation of our crops. We are making continued advancements that protect and help the fish, particularly salmon, that are part of this ecosystem.
I vow to protect and fight in Washington DC for these four dams and the hundreds of other dams that our communities, economies, and environment depend upon.
As your next Congressman in CD 2, I will remain true to the Rural & Eastern Oregon values I was raised with and you can trust me to vote in Washington just as I talk in Oregon.
Thank you for your support!
Sincerely,
CLIFF BENTZ

Alex, Maxine Waters is hiding from me.
As the Republican nominee running against radical leftist Maxine, I publicly challenged her to a debate at the beginning of the month.
Typical of a 40+ year career politician who has done NOTHING to help her crumbing district, she has ignored my challenge.
But while Maxine Waters is hiding from me, she’s sending gangsters and thugs to my events to harass me and my supporters.
I need your help to flush radical, cowardly Maxine Waters out of hiding and hold her accountable for her failed socialist policies. Please chip in $250, $100, $50 or even just $25 or $10 to support my campaign and help me defeat Maxine.
Flush Maxine out »
Maxine Waters doesn’t care about our community, and she certainly doesn’t care about black lives.
She’s getting rich off of making a career out of viscously attacking President Trump and conservatives like you and me.
Meanwhile, her failed socialist policies have only resulted in more poverty, joblessness, homelessness, crime and violence in our district.
That’s what Maxine Waters has done to my home, and that’s what she’ll do to the rest of the country if we don’t remove her from office – which is why I need your support today.
Maxine Waters needs to face me and her constituents and answer for her failures. I need your help to flush Maxine out of hiding and force her to debate me – then I need your help to defeat her.
For the good of our country, help me hold radical Maxine Waters accountable by making a contribution of $250, $100, $50 or even $25, $10 or another amount today.

Alex,
We are in the middle of a crisis. But it is important to remember that the Democrats are exploiting that crisis to try to pass the Green New Deal and if they take back the Senate this Fall, that’s what they’ll do.
That is why I am writing on behalf of my friend Senator Steve Daines, a conservative Republican from Montana.
Steve is tough on crime, he stands up to China, and he’s against illegal immigration. He’s being challenged by failed presidential candidate Steve Bullock who is weak on China and wants open borders.
And this race will be close. If we lose in Montana, the Republican Senate majority will be gone.
Donate NOW to help protect the Republican Senate Majority.
I am asking you to make a contribution to Steve Daines’ campaign. 100% of what you donate will go to help Daines win Montana and help us keep the Senate.
We can’t afford to lose a good conservative like Steve Daines – especially to radical liberal Steve Bullock who is weak on China.
Steve will fight back against the left-wing mob and their radical agenda and that’s why they are going to spend MILLIONS to defeat him.
Will you chip in $5, $25, $50 or even $100 to help hold the Senate Majority and help my friend Senator Steve Daines?
There is so much at stake in this election and the liberal mob is more fired up than ever to defeat Trump Conservatives all across the country.
Republicans are being outraised and outspent. With November fast approaching we need to catch up and ensure we have the resources to fight back and expand our Senate Majority.
Democrats know that their path to the Senate Majority runs through Montana.
If Steve Daines loses in Montana – Chuck Schumer will become Senate Majority leader and the liberal mob will have total control.
We cannot let that happen.
Donate NOW to help protect the Republican Senate Majority.
In service,

Our LAST end-of-quarter fundraising deadline is just one week away. I can't believe Election Day is so close and yet we are still fighting tooth and nail to meet our critical fundraising goals.
Frankly, that's why I am reaching out today. I need to raise $32,427 in the next 7 DAYS to combat the Democrats' attacks.
HELP DEBBIE REACH HER GOAL ➔
The radical-Left hates that I am standing for LAW AND ORDER in our communities. They don't want to see our families safe... they want to allow rioters and looters to burn our cities to the ground.
Just last week, I introduced the Holding Rioters Accountable Act of 2020, which would allow the attorney general to withhold up to ten percent of Department of Justice (DOJ) grants from cities, states, and other local governments that fail to prosecute crimes that arose from riots and other violent protests.
I am in Washington fighting for this bill to become a law, campaigning is not my first priority – the safety of your family is.
But there is still an election in 41 days. Which is why I need your financial support today to keep me fighting for you in the House. Will you make an urgent donation of $15 or more right now to help me reach my critical goal?

706,"Yesterday on Medium, I dug into Tom Cotton’s recent remarks.
Dear Alex,
When America’s greatness comes only at the expense of others, we all lose. Sadly, I was reminded of this important truth last weekend when Senator Tom Cotton referred to slavery as being “the necessary evil upon which the union was built.”
It is easy to see Cotton’s remarks are disturbing –– even more so when we consider he made this statement to defend his opposition to teaching about the history of slavery in our schools. But, we also should remember that the notion that evil is sometimes necessary for prosperity is not a relic of history or limited to academic debates.
Yesterday on Medium, I dug into Cotton’s remarks and what they mean about how we justify evil today with a piece titled Evil Is Never Necessary In America.
Today in America, business executives accept cutting jobs as a “necessary evil” for improving a company’s quarterly earnings. Policymakers accept warehousing lawbreakers, especially if poor and Black, as a “necessary evil” to reducing crime.
The idea that slavery was a necessary part of America’s founding implies that for some to flourish in our country others must be hurt. As you can read more of my thoughts on Medium, we cannot let these kinds of ideas win out. At a time when the public is collectively examining what our responsibilities are to each other and how to account for the inequality we have tolerated for so long, it behooves us to reconsider and to reject the kinds of “necessary evils” we have accepted before.
Together we can and we must do better.
Sincerely,
Deval Patrick

Omari Faulkner
Fellow American,
The Democratic party stopped paying attention to black voters years ago.
They stood by as our communities suffered without jobs, without opportunity, and without growth. While crime, high homicide rates, underperforming schools, and high poverty rates plagued black voters, the DNC stood by with nothing to offer but liberal grandstanding.
But there's been a real awakening under President Donald Trump and black voters are finally leaving the Democrats behind. They're calling it BLEXIT (black-exit) and I hope you will join me today to support the movement and support my candidacy.

Fellow American, the truth of the matter is that Democrats cry racism while ignoring important issues such as unemployment, criminal justice reform, education, and economic opportunity — all issues President Donald Trump and conservatives in Congress have been delivering on since the day he took office.
It may not be what we expected, but a Republican president has finally achieved more tangible wins for the African American community than the Democrats ever have.
Now, all they've got left is their racist manipulations and all-to-familiar rhetoric that gets us NOWHERE.
I think it's clear: we are better than the Democrats’ games.
If you agree that the black community deserves MORE, please chip in now.
It's time to get behind a real BLEXIT movement.

708,"Mayor Tubbs shares his story with you in our next #MayorsTakeTheMic
Bloomberg Philanthropies
Friend,
Mayor Michael Tubbs took office in Stockton, California, in January 2017 -- when he was just 26 years old. He was the youngest mayor of an American city with more than 100,000 residents, Stockton's first Black mayor, and the leader of a city facing significant challenges. His story has been an inspiration to many, shared on the TED Talk stage, The Daily Show, and most recently in an HBO documentary ""Stockton on My Mind"" that premiered last month.
Today, you have a chance to hear directly from Mayor Tubbs, as he takes over Mike's Instagram account for our latest #MayorsTakeThe Mic.
#MayorsTaketheMic
[[URL REDACTED]]
Mayor Tubbs will be answering questions and sharing stories with the nation -- from how the pandemic is impacting Stockton's families, to the community's effort to #reinventStockton. Mayor Tubbs is also holding two live sessions today, one with Mayor Melvin Carter of Saint Paul, Minnesota, starting at 5:30 p.m. ET. The two mayors will discuss current events impacting our nation and their work to push for a guaranteed income. Then at 7:30 p.m. ET, Mayor Tubbs will hold a live question and answer session.
Since taking office in Stockton, Mayor Tubbs has put forward innovative, data-driven ideas to strengthen his city. Those have included a pilot program on basic income, a citywide scholarship program for high school graduates, and a public safety initiative focused on the less than one percent of Stockton's population known to commit gun crimes.
We're excited to spend the day with him on Mike's Instagram for our latest #MayorsTakeTheMic, and we hope you'll join in:

709,"Sara Gideon is ready to keep serving Maine as a U.S. Senator. But the polls show that this race is going to be competitive, and Susan Collins is a longtime incumbent who won't be easy to beat. That's Warren Democrats
Alex,
The people of Maine deserve a senator who puts them first.
They deserve a senator who fights to make our country work for everyone, not just the special interests.
They deserve a senator who isn't afraid to speak truth to power.
They deserve Sara Gideon, the Democratic nominee for this November — not their current GOP senator, Susan Collins.
Let's help elect Sara Gideon, unseat Susan Collins, and flip one of the key seats Democrats need to take back the Senate.
Alex, if making a donation makes sense for you right now, please chip in $2 or whatever you can to support Sara Gideon and Warren Democrats so we can win big in Maine and across the country.
So, let's talk about Susan Collins.
In 2018, when she cast one of the deciding votes to give Brett Kavanaugh a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, she said that he would uphold precedents that protect abortion rights.
How did that work out? Well, last month, he voted to overturn one of those precedents — and now, he's got Roe v. Wade in his sights.
Earlier this year, when Susan Collins voted against convicting Donald Trump in the Senate, she said that he didn't need to be held accountable because he'd already ""learned his lesson.""
Yeah, sure, he's learned his lesson — he's learned there are enough Republican enablers in the Senate who will let him do anything he wants. He's learned that lesson so well that last week, he rewarded Roger Stone with a presidential pardon for committing crimes to protect Trump.
Meanwhile, as Speaker of Maine's House of Representatives, Sara Gideon has been clear-eyed about the corruption that rewards the wealthy and well-connected, and committed to getting results for the people she serves.
Sara Gideon has helped protect health care for Mainers with pre-existing conditions, fight the opioid crisis by expanding treatment and prevention while pledging to hold giant drug companies accountable for causing this crisis, and stood up for reproductive justice.
Now, Sara Gideon is ready to keep serving Maine as a U.S. Senator. But the polls show that this race is going to be competitive, and Susan Collins is a longtime incumbent who won't be easy to beat.
We need to fight side by side as a grassroots movement to send Sara Gideon to Washington. Can you make a donation right now to support her campaign and Democrats like her up and down the ticket? Anything you can contribute would make a real difference in this powerfully important race.
Thanks for being a part of this,
Elizabeth

We are just hours away from our end of the month fundraising deadline, and my team has informed me that we are only $5,000 short of our monthly goal – can I count on you to help us reach our goal?
With just 34 days left until the critical election on November 3rd, we are in the final stretch, and the stakes couldn’t be higher.
My opponent, Nate McMurray, is fully on board with the radical socialist agenda of higher taxes, the green new deal, higher crime, and less freedom – and we cannot let him get the chance to enact it.
Here in Western New York – we reject those radical policies, and we reject politicians who blatantly mock our values – and he takes any chance he gets to put down our way of life.
Meanwhile, I’m proud to be an American, and I’m proud to represent our great region in Congress. Since being elected in June, I have been fighting for our small businesses, fighting for our farmers, and fighting to hold China accountable.
And I’m going to keep doing that in my next term. My opponent has crazy ideas and radical policies – but I’ve got solutions, and I am implementing them.
And I need you. Together, we will keep fighting for the America we know and love, and we are going to keep fighting for policies that make our nation stronger. Can I count on you to help us reach our goal?
We are in a battle for the future of our country, and it is going to take every one of us to stop Nancy, Nate, and Joe Biden – let’s go win this!

712,"Or at least tax them.
Alex,
It’s a tale as old as time: When a country experiences extreme levels of economic inequality, society begins to break down.
Workers riot, crime increases, life satisfaction goes down, and people take to the streets. We saw it in Greece during the height of the protests against austerity measures in 2014. We saw it in Puerto Rico with the mass protests in 2019, and we saw it in the U.S. with the Occupy Wall Street movement after the economy collapsed in 2007.
I view participatory democracy as the best way to solve the problem of economic inequality. That’s why I got into politics.
There’s a picture of me that I took in Greece next to a sign that says “Eat the Rich” -- it’s not that I hate rich people. I just want to preserve our society for future generations.
My commitment is to improving the lives of everyday New Yorkers. That’s why I’m running for Congress. Billionaires don’t need a champion in government -- the rest of us do. This is what drives me to keep fighting everyday. And your support has meant the world to me.

We hate to break it to you, Mr. President, but you are not, in fact, the chief law enforcement official. Though, our real chief law enforcement official, William Barr, isn’t much better.
By now, we know that Trump relishes abusing his power. And after the Senate acquittal, the President is feeling more emboldened than ever.
But this week, Trump did something we haven’t seen before. He went on a pardoning spree and granted clemency to 11 convicted criminals -- some are his friends and some were convicted for the same crimes he’s been accused of. And of course, let’s not forget the time Trump pardoned Scooter Libby for illegally revealing my identity as a covert CIA officer.
While Trump continues to interfere in our justice system, we need to remain focused on electing leaders who will speak truth to power and keep the president in check. Though none of his recent actions are all that surprising, we cannot afford to get complacent.

Roger Stone is the shadiest operative in politics. After decades of “dirty tricks” pulled on behalf of Republicans, Robert Mueller’s investigation finally brought Stone to [[URL REDACTED]] so we thought.
When Russia interfered in our election in 2016 by hacking emails to help Donald Trump get elected, Roger Stone coordinated with Wikileaks to make it happen.
Thanks to the Mueller investigation, a jury found Stone guilty of lying to the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee under oath, obstructing justice, and witness tampering and a judge sentenced him to three and a half years in prison.
But this week, right before Stone was set to report to prison, Trump granted his friend clemency. Stone won’t face any penalties for the crimes he committed on Trump’s behalf.
It is an outrage and an affront to our democracy.
FIGHT BACK
Last night, Politico revealed that my opponent, Elise Stefanik, supported commuting Stone’s sentence, but during a ride on Air Force 1, she asked Trump to wait until after the election so that the American public wouldn’t hold her and other Republicans accountable for being complicit in Trump’s abuses of power.
She doesn’t care about truth and justice, she only cares about herself. She truly represents the worst of Washington.
Let’s show Elise that there are consequences to shamelessly supporting Trump at the expense of our democracy. Please pitch in whatever you can to our campaign today so we can defeat her in November.

RE: Janicek Car Stolen
Earlier this week, Democratic Candidate for United States Senate Chris Janicek had his car stolen in broad daylight. “I was loading an order for Union Pacific in the middle of the day outside the shop on 50th, and someone jumped in my Honda element and made off with my car speeding north with the hatch open.” said Janicek.
Janicek filed last week to run for the United States Senate seat currently held by Republican Ben Sasse.
Janicek commented, “Thank goodness there was only one tray of cupcakes in the car. If there were anymore, if would have been a real tragedy” he said with a smile. The candidate later reported the theft to OPD who followed up an official file and a suggestion to post the incident on Facebook.
“Things like this shouldn’t happen anywhere…” Janicek continued. “Especially not here in the great state of Nebraska!” Janicek said it is up to us all to be watchful and to have each other’s back. The most recent Omaha statistics showed 4,079 annual vehicle thefts. According to recently released FBI crime statistics, the area's rate of about 442 vehicle thefts per 100,000 residents ranked 18th among the 100 most-populous cities.
“Crime happens in Omaha and it happens in Scottsbluff but we are all in this together. So, let’s watch out for everyone and have a safe and happy new year.” Janicek concluded.

716,"For Roger Williams to cartoonishly deny his participation when a reporter was standing right there and saw the whole thing is a failure and it’s hugely embarrassing for Texas.
# Julie Oliver for Congress
Team,
Women face misogyny doing the most innocuous things imaginable. So it's unsurprising — but profoundly disappointing — that Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was attacked with misogynistic, vulgar language by two of her colleagues while on her way to vote yesterday morning.
Representative Ted Yoho yelled in her face, used a sexist slur, and stalked off angrily — all because Rep. Ocasio-Cortez had the temerity to note the well-established link between poverty and crime.
The other colleague standing beside Yoho while he ranted was Roger Williams, Julie's Republican opponent. He claimed he had no involvement in the exchange, to which Rep. Ocasio-Cortez replied that he not only observed the abuse and failed to intervene, he actively participated, screaming something about “throwing urine” at the Congresswoman.
Headline
At this point, this just feels all too familiar. A woman speaks truth to power, and those who feel threatened explode about it.
For Roger Williams to cartoonishly deny his participation when a reporter was standing right there and saw the whole thing is a failure and it's hugely embarrassing for Texas.
But this transcends politics.
Too many women face sexist abuse just like this in their own workplaces. Too many men feel entitled to attack and dismiss women with ugly slurs and sexist language.
We have to change the culture of toxicity and dysfunction that has captured our politics, and our society. We're working hard to elect a representative like Julie who will lead, not follow — and it's why we hope you'll join us and support our campaign today.
CONTRIBUTE $5
The people of this district — the women of this district, many of whom have faced similar sexist abuse — deserve so much better.
Misogyny has no place in any workspace, much less the United States Congress. The first step toward ending that culture is ousting people like Roger Williams and sending more women who are unafraid to speak truth to power to Congress.
That's why we're going to continue fighting every day to win this election, and why we hope you'll stand with us all the way until November.
Thanks for being in this fight with us,
Team Julie

Last Week in Canvassing
This past weekend, we knocked more than 350 doors in East Flatbush to bring our message of finding new solutions to problems we all face. We talked about tech privacy and the need for Washington to catch up to new technology.
We also heard about the issues people in the community are facing in their daily lives. A few people talked to us about package theft happening in the area. Some mentioned fear of crime and gun violence while others spoke about the struggle around housing. Even something as simple as tree planting and disposal is something we hear this community needs.
We also ran into some other people out in the neighborhood from Attorney General Letitia James' office warning members of the community about deed theft and the dangers of scammers. You can find more information on that and other assistance here: [[URL REDACTED]]
Next weekend we'll be out in East Flatbush again near Linden Blvd E 37th St. Come out and join us or just stop by to say hello!

America is experiencing a moment of national anguish, as we grieve for the Black Americans killed by police brutality.
I know you might be feeling overwhelmed at the moment.
My heart grieves for every single victim of police violence, too.
This moment of national anguish, however, has been transformed into a movement of national action, as Americans from across the country peacefully protest to demand an end to the injustice -- and I’m so inspired to see you rising up for change.
That’s why, at this very moment, Democrats and I are working tirelessly to end police brutality.
We need to hold police more accountable, make lynching a federal crime, address systemic racial discrimination, and de-militarize the police.
But I need your help to demand this change.

Alex,
Cutting public safety budgets has officially begun, as cowardly politicians in California and New York bow down to the liberal mob and abandon their fundamental responsibility to protect people. Los Angeles politicians slashed $145 million from the Sheriff's Department - targeting the gang unit, human trafficking, crimes involving children, rape, and major crimes bureau. New York City's Mayor De Blasio goes further and cuts the NYPD by a billion dollars as shootings and violent crime surge.
Make no mistake, liberals nationwide will want to use this as a model to defund any organization that protects law and order. We will NOT allow politicians to cut police budgets and let criminals loose. We should be DEFENDING the police, not defunding them. Please stand with me to tell the left that we will not defund our police units!

Liberals are intent on taking the police officers who protect and serve off the streets while leaving criminals on the streets. This is completely backward: we must DEFEND our men and women who serve as police and first responders, not defund them. It’s up to us to to stand up to the anarchist mob.
SAY NO TO DEFUNDING THE POLICE!

Alex,
I'd like to tell you a story about Jon that you may not know. Nearly three years ago, I began doing some work in the community to stop domestic violence. A woman and her four-year old child had been murdered by her ex-boyfriend, who then killed himself. The case made an imprint on me. A mother and her child were dead. There was a vigil and some media coverage of the deaths, but nobody seemed to be asking many questions.
I had been prosecuting domestic violence cases for about four years at that time and believed more could be done in the community to stop interpersonal violence. I began meeting with experts in the field in Kalamazoo and throughout Michigan, learning about the role that trauma, and witnessing or experiencing violence as a child has on people who go on to become abusive themselves. I learned that suffering trauma is the leading indicator that a person will hurt someone else.
First, we wrestled with the question of which action or set of actions to take to create real change in the community. We knew that trauma contributed significantly to interpersonal violence in the community, but we weren't sure how to address it. After much discussion, the answer came in the form of a new treatment court - a court that treated trauma as a root cause of crime and family violence. Just as Drug Courts treat addiction to reduce crime and recidivism, this court program would treat trauma to reduce violence perpetration. The concept became known as the Kalamazoo County Trauma & Resiliency Court, a first of its kind endeavor in our country.
Next, we were faced with the question of where to turn to provide funding for trauma survivors and their families. Treatment for trauma survivors would help reduce interpersonal violence in the community, but as we all know, treatment costs money. And trauma survivors often lack the resources to pay for quality treatment out of pocket. Particularly, the kind of treatment that effectively calms trauma reactivity and heals families in the process.
Jon Hoadley answered the call. I met with Jon to discuss our efforts and he immediately offered to help. He fought for, and won, funding in the state legislature to create the new treatment court program in Kalamazoo County.
The Trauma & Resiliency Court program will fundamentally change the way we understand and treat trauma survivors in the community, offering survivors help and healing, instead of more pain and punishment. It will mean fewer trauma victims and more resilience in and through the justice system.
I want you to know the critical role Jon played in helping trauma survivors in this community. Nobody has ever done anything like this anywhere in the country or, so far as I know, the world. Unfortunately, the voices of trauma survivors are often ignored in the criminal justice system, as this survivor details in this piece. They repeatedly ask for more resources to treat and heal trauma, but are instead given pain and punishment. Jon is helping to end this injustice in Kalamazoo and bend the arc just a little more.
This is yet one more reason to support Jon Hoadley with your time and money. Jon is doing more for trauma survivors in this community than Upton ever has or ever will. He is quietly, but fundamentally, changing the way we view and treat survivors in the justice system.
I hope you’ll join me in supporting Jon’s campaign.
In politics these days, we too often see the mean and the ugly, the distortion of truth, hurtful words and misdeeds that have come to define the Trump era. Upton, through the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), benefits from this kind of politics.
Jon is different. Jon cares about people. Jon cares about this community. He's fighting for Kalamazoo in Lansing each and every day, and will do the same in Washington, D.C. when we send him to Congress this November. Let's help him get there.
I know this was a long email. If you've gotten to this line, thank you. Let's give Jon the best thanks we can in the coming weeks by voting to retire Upton.
Sincerely yours,
Joe

721,"Good evening,
I voted to impeach President Donald Trump tonight because if Congress did not hold him accountable for his actions, we would have forsaken our duty, betrayed our oaths of office, and sent the message that some people can avoid justice.
We don't let that happen in America. No one is above the law.
By abusing his power, extorting an ally to meddle in our elections, endangering our democratic process, placing our national security at risk, lying to the American people about his schemes, and obstructing legitimate Congressional investigations, the President has committed impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors.
Nobody comes to Congress to impeach a President. When you elected me in 2009, I pledged an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. Just because the President of the United States has chosen not to honor his oath, does not mean that I will abandon mine.
Today, I cast my vote to protect the future of our democracy and to preserve it for generations to come.
Thank you for all your support and kindness during these difficult times. Our country will get through this together. I promise.

Over the past few years, more than 20 states have passed new laws restricting how people can buy and carry guns in response to our nation’s epidemic of gun violence.
Over the past few years, more than 20 states have passed new laws restricting how people can buy and carry guns in response to our nation’s epidemic of gun violence.
But these common-sense reforms are undermined by gun trafficking made possible by looser gun laws in neighboring states -- about 50,000 guns are diverted to criminals across state lines every year, and it’s likely that many more go undetected.
That’s why Sean helped introduce the Gun Trafficker Detection Act, which would require gun owners to report a lost or stolen gun within 48 hours.
This legislation will help law enforcement identify and prosecute traffickers, who often claim their gun was lost or stolen when it turns up at a crime scene in another state -- and hold them liable for any damage done by their guns!
'I'm tired of hearing lawmakers offer their 'thoughts and prayers' after every new report of a tragic mass shooting. It's time to offer Americans smart, effective gun laws that will save lives.' - Sean Casten

As we take steps to address the institutionalized racism and violence that corrupts America’s justice system, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020, a critical set of reforms to make law enforcement officials more accountable to the communities they serve.
The bill will:
* remove barriers to prosecuting police officers and recover damages from officers who have violated civilians' rights;
* require body and dashboard cameras, ban chokeholds, and end no-knock warrants in drug cases;
* demilitarize the police by cutting the transfer of military weapons to state and local police departments;
* compile additional, more accurate, data of police brutality to hold officers publicly accountable;
* increase pressure on the Justice Department to actually tackle systemic racial discrimination by law enforcement; and
* make lynching a federal crime, building on the House's passage of the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act earlier this year.
We cannot take this for granted. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020 is still just a proposal. We need to make it the law of the land and then keep on going. Please add your voice to the chorus of Americans who are demanding real change, who refuse to go back to the same old way of doing things.
And then we keep moving forward, knowing that the broader, deeper conversation about race and the legacy of slavery in our country must be honestly embraced by every person of good will, but knowing as well that conversation alone is not enough.
Justice demands action.

Today is the two-year anniversary of the tragic shooting that took the lives of five staff members of the Capital Gazette. As one who has had the privilege of representing Annapolis in Congress for the last fourteen years, I join you in remembering Rob, John, Wendi, Rebecca, and Gerald. Together, we can and will carry their legacy forward.
For me, that includes fighting for critical gun safety reforms, because this cycle of violence continues to be repeated over and over again across our country. It also means standing up for journalists who play such a vital role in our daily lives.
To honor the memory of this senseless crime that shocked the Annapolis community, I invite you to support the Capital Gazette Memorial Scholarship Fund, which provides an annual award for journalism students at the University of Maryland, College Park.
In the same way that the surviving members of the Gazette newsroom refused to be silenced — regrouping to publish the paper the very next day after the shooting — so too we must not be silent in our advocacy for gun safety and for freedom of the press.
Please stand with me in support of the Capital Gazette by making a donation to their Memorial Scholarship Fund.

Dear Friend,
The vote this past week was the first entirely partisan vote for impeachment in our country’s history, representing a high-water mark of partisan politics and a new low for the standard of impeachment of a sitting president.
There have been no high crimes or misdemeanors, simply an impeachment rooted in hearsay, assumptions, and lies.
What we witnessed since even before President Trump took office is a predetermined agenda of impeachment to fulfill campaign promises made by the socialist Majority in control of half of Congress.
They don’t like him or his policies - the same policies which have led to record economic growth - so they decided to impeach and overturn the will of 63 million Americans.
As for me, I will stand by the truth and the facts and continue to fight for our President every day, just as he fights for all of us.
Sincerely,
JS

People & Planet > Profit
Hello my powerful supporter--
The past two weeks have been filled with learning, growing and grieving as I continue to consciously investigate the reality of violence and oppression that is woven into American life against black people.
My last message to you was filled with sadness about George Floyd's murder. Today, I am filled with confusion, frustration and guilt regarding how my participation in our collective compliance and silence continues to create pain, trauma and suffering for millions of people.
The only way I know how to help transform emotion into empowered action is to share my process and invite others to engage with the same tools I'm personally finding transformative on the path of becoming anti-racist.
In this video, I share the biggest insight I've gotten so far from Mehcad Brooks's 21-day Anti-racist Challenge:
# Police violence and racism is a
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.
We can’t solve a problem if we don’t make the correct diagnosis.
We must acknowledge and accept that dark-skinned Americans live with a persistent threat of violence initiated by the police-- even when they follow all of the rules and abide by all of the laws.
We must acknowledge and accept that to leave one's house with a sense of guaranteed safety is a privilege only people born into white-bodies can experience.
We must acknowledge and accept that white Americans and black Americans live in two different worlds, with two sets of rules and societal expectations for success and crime.
These are not my opinions. These are uncomfortable and inconvenient facts of American life and policies that affect safety, health, education and economic security.
We don't need to be experts in race relations or history or public policy to know that something is profoundly wrong and inhumane in dominant American culture, politics and legal system.
And if we seriously want to change our country, we must first investigate changing ourselves.
Join me on the 21-Day Anti-Racist Challenge  as your personal next step towards prioritizing people and planet over profits.
With grief and gratitude,
Christine

As a former federal prosecutor and a New York State consumer-protection regulator, I devoted myself to taking on bullies, fraudsters, and cheats, who thought the rules didn’t apply to them. I did this because I believe that no one should be permitted to stand in the way of anyone’s right to fulfill their potential and pursue their unique version of the American Dream.
I know crime and corruption when I see it, and I am proud to see our representatives stand up to the Fraudster in Chief in the White House.
Our Founding Fathers understood that if “men were angels, no government would be necessary.” But “the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.”
One of those “auxiliary precautions” was the power and duty of impeachment. Our Constitution vested in the House of Representatives the power and duty to impeach “Officers of the United States” who betray the public trust and misuse the power of their office in corrupt pursuit of personal gain.
By impeaching President Donald Trump last night, the House of Representatives satisfied its solemn obligation. Perhaps no one in our Country’s history has tried so hard as President Trump to corrupt our constitutional republic. His efforts to condition congressional aid to Ukraine upon Ukraine’s investigation of President Trump’s political rival is but one impeachable example of his craven corruption.
While I hope that the Senate now rises to their constitutional duty to conduct a fair trial, I know we cannot rest and rely upon that hope. We need leaders in Congress who will continue to stand up to bullies, fraudsters, and cheats. I hope you will join me in that effort and contribute today.

I need you to make me a promise. I need you to promise to vote this November, friends.
Because if you want police officers held accountable for crimes they commit, then you need to vote and elect prosecutors who will do so.
If you want new training practices and stronger thresholds for use-of-force, then you need to vote for officials who will make these changes and ensure real accountability.
And if you want leaders in Washington who have morals, the courage to lead with compassion, and practice love for all people -- then you must vote this November.
Do not stop demanding change, do not slow down, and do not forget to vote this November. I promise to vote for change, and I hope you will, too.
I Promise
In 2018, we ran a campaign driven by love and compassion for one another and took back our voice in Congress. Voters went to the polls in historic numbers and did what many considered impossible by flipping a red, rural district blue.
The power of our vote can reform our broken criminal system, make leaders who use violence against peaceful protestors cower, and make the dismantling of systemic racism possible. But only if we continue to speak truth and vote our conscience.
That's why I'm asking you to please promise to vote this November. Cast your ballot with love in your heart and progress on your mind. If you do, a change will come.
I Promise
With love,

As published in the New York Times:
Staring Down Impeachment Vote, Freshman Democrat Seeks Legislative Victories
As Representative Antonio Delgado, a moderate New York Democrat, eyes a politically risky impeachment vote, he is toiling to keep his focus on legislative business and district work.
RHINEBECK, N.Y. — On a recent Friday, as impeachment investigators were releasing new evidence of President Trump’s pressure campaign on Ukraine and John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, was refusing through his lawyer to tell Congress what he knew about ""many relevant meetings and conversations"" in the matter, Representative Antonio Delgado’s mind was elsewhere.
Driving through his Hudson Valley district under a light snow, Mr. Delgado, a first-term Democrat, was preoccupied with legislation he was pursuing, toxic chemical cleanup provisions he was fighting to include in a must-pass defense bill, the farmers he was scheduled to meet and his push to hold 33 town hall-style meetings by the end of December.
Before the sun set at 4:45 p.m., Mr. Delgado would trek 175 miles across the district, scarfing down a breakfast of fluffy pancakes with his wife and twin sons early in the morning so he could attend a school assembly, then making last-minute edits to a speech in the car in between events. It barely left time to brush up on the latest news in the impeachment inquiry consuming Washington.
With five legislative days remaining before Congress leaves for its holiday break, the House is charging toward a party-line vote on impeachment articles against Mr. Trump that will make him only the third president to be impeached. The vote is a politically risky one for freshman lawmakers like Mr. Delgado who won by narrow margins in districts that supported Mr. Trump in 2016, and one that the president and his political allies have argued will cost them their seats.
A spotlight on the people reshaping our politics. A conversation with voters across the country. And a guiding hand through the endless news cycle, telling you what you really need to know.
Mr. Delgado has signaled that he is willing to face the consequences. While he has not announced formally that he will support the articles of impeachment when they come to a vote next week, likely on Wednesday, he said in September that the president’s pressure campaign against Ukraine ""by itself, is an impeachable offense"" and concluded that articles were warranted.
That has made it all the more important for Mr. Delgado and Democrats like him to find ways to show voters they are getting things done in Congress, which is why he is crisscrossing his district through flurries, working on local issues and connecting with constituents.
""You feel the tempo, you feel the strain of it,"" Mr. Delgado said, describing how he has adapted to the life of a congressman. ""And then you adjust for it.""
Speaker Nancy Pelosi has had members like Mr. Delgado at the top of her mind throughout the inquiry, and it is their concerns that have compelled her to sandwich next week’s impeachment vote in between passage of critical legislation to fund the government and a sweeping revision of the NAFTA trade pact.
Ms. Pelosi knows, as many moderate Democrats do, that the important question is not necessarily how they explain a vote to charge the president with high crimes and misdemeanors, but whether they can show that they are delivering on an agenda of legislative work that affects voters’ everyday lives.
Mr. Delgado has not completely shied away from impeachment. When news broke of Mr. Trump’s phone call with the Ukrainian president that is at the heart of the charges, he announced that Congress should begin drafting impeachment articles, going further than most of his moderate colleagues, who tentatively endorsed investigating the allegations. The House Republican campaign arm, eager to tie Mr. Delgado to the liberal wing of the party, called it a ""political death sentence"" and has repeatedly accused him of ""pandering to his socialist base.""
Impeachment Inquiry Through it all, Mr. Delgado has tried to strike a balance, cultivating relationships with Republicans — with his wife, he was one of only a few House Democrats to show up this week at the White House Congressional Ball, even as the Judiciary Committee was debating the articles of impeachment — while offering unsparing criticism of the president’s conduct.
""There’s an abuse of power,"" Mr. Delgado said after the Ukraine allegations surfaced, speaking to voters in the town of Clinton. ""And the abuse of power, too, layers over that crime in a way that I think really creates a level of urgency.""
But Mr. Delgado would prefer to talk about other things: his work on three committees, the enactment of his bill to ease financial burdens for farmers, and a grueling schedule traveling to all corners of his 8,000 square-mile district.
""It matters a lot to go back home and say I introduced a bill,"" Mr. Delgado, a lawyer, Rhodes Scholar and Harvard Law graduate, said in an interview. ""Even if it’s not law, they know that their congressman is working on an issue they flagged.""
""Do you know how powerful that is?"" he added. ""That democracy is still humming ahead a little bit?""
A black congressman in a district in which voters are more than 80 percent white, Mr. Delgado is an unmistakable presence. At 6 feet 4 inches, Mr. Delgado — a former basketball player and Upstate New York hall of fame inductee — is rarely introduced without some quip about his height. And he is the only African-American who holds one of the 14 districts that flipped from voting for President Barack Obama to backing Mr. Trump in 2016. His victory came after a campaign in which Republicans used decades-old lyrics from his brief tenure as a rap artist to suggest he was misogynistic and anti-American, a line of attack widely denounced as racist.
But since January, Mr. Delgado, who was born just outside the district and moved back to the area after the 2016 election, has also amplified his engagement in one of the most rural counties represented by a Democrat. He has held nearly three dozen town hall-style meetings — three in each of the 11 counties in his district — and made a point of introducing bipartisan legislation with a number of his Republican colleagues. Sometimes, he includes his twins in his trips through the county — including a visit to a local bookstore on a recent Saturday, where he posed with a Muhammad Ali biography and his sons’ book selections. (Mr. Delgado, who considers Mr. Ali a personal hero, frequently wears a wristband that reads, ""Find greatness within."")
His first television ad — believed to be the first from a House Democrat in the 2020 campaign — focused on his litany of events and legislation introduced, even as Republicans sought to tie him to calls for impeachment and more liberal members of the caucus.
""He’s been good to work with,"" said Jake Ashby, a local Republican assemblyman who recently participated in a veterans’ event with Mr. Delgado. Pointing toward some of the bills Mr. Delgado has championed, he added, ""He’s been able to get them through, and that’s been encouraging to see.""
At one October gathering, Asejah Lazerson, from Pleasant Valley, N.Y., came to see Mr. Delgado after she wrote a letter about her challenges finding employment and taking care of her children. Mr. Delgado had followed up with a 30-minute phone call.
""It feels like my voice isn’t being heard, and there’s so much gridlock in Washington, all this bitter fighting and nothing is getting done,"" Ms. Lazerson said in an interview. ""For him to call me and let me know that he heard my letter, and read my letter, and it touched him — it was very reassuring.""
""Every time I tell my story, I don’t know if anybody cares,"" she added, after wiping away tears. Her son ended up writing a report on Mr. Delgado for school.
At a Veterans Day breakfast last month, Walter O’Neil, a Marine veteran, shook Mr. Delgado’s hand and cheerfully informed his congressman, ""I didn’t vote for you.""
""That’s all right,"" Mr. Delgado replied with a smile. ""I’m still serving you."" (In a brief interview afterward, Mr. O’Neil conceded that Mr. Delgado ""is doing a good job."")
But moments later, a couple rushed to Mr. Delgado’s side, professing to be his biggest fans and asking for a picture.
""It was like meeting a rock star,"" said Barbara Holms, 64, who came to the event with her husband, Michael, who served with the Navy during the Vietnam War. ""He doesn’t lip sync. He shows up.""

ASK MOE: POLICE REFORM IS COMING
We receive questions from voters all of the time and do our best to try to answer them. Here’s Moe’s response on policies involving police reform:
> “In the wake of the murder of George Floyd and many others, which have prompted both peaceful protests and violence in the streets across our country in recent weeks, I have been asked about police reform policies I would support.
> First, let me say that I believe this is a historic reckoning for the years and years of racial injustice. How we move forward from this moment will define who we are as a nation. We must be on the right side of history.
> As you may know, I have had many colleagues of color -- as a student at North Carolina Central University, where I earned my law degree, and as a law professor at Howard University. I have stood my whole professional life trying to fight injustice, wherever and however I encountered it. In Congress, I will do the same.
> We must change our culture and we can begin to do so by changing our laws. On the federal level, I support ending qualified immunity so that police officers can be held liable for violating the rights of people they serve. I would also push to establish a federal model policing program, adopting policies from the #8CantWait campaign that create standards of conduct and emphasize de-escalation and the use of non-lethal force. And it is long past time to make lynching a federal hate crime.
> Finally, we need to create a database to track complaints of officer misconduct, officer-involved shootings, use-of-force incidents and misuse of body cams, to begin to bring some accountability to our 18,000 police agencies across the country.
> Some of these policies are part of the House police reform bill – another effort at much needed change. And they are a good start. I look forward to continuing to improve on these when I am in Congress.
> Rest assured, change is coming. Finally.”
We will have more on this in the near future.
PRINCIPAL CHIEF SNEED JOINS MOE TALKS!
We are excited to announce that Richard G. Sneed, Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, will join Moe on Moe Talks on Thursday, July 9 at 7 p.m.
Principal Chief Sneed, a former Marine and longtime teacher, manages day-to-day operations for the 15,000-member EBCI based in the Qualla Boundary in Western North Carolina.
“I have a lot to learn about the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and what a member of Congress can do to be an effective advocate for their interests, so I’m grateful to Principal Chief Sneed for taking time to talk to me,’’ Davis said. “He and I are both military veterans and former educators, so we share a common commitment to our country and our communities.”
SAVING DACA
Imagine growing up in America, working hard to gain an education, earning a job and paying taxes like everyone else. Imagine living that American dream and then being told after doing everything right for years that you will have to move to a country you have never known because you weren't born here.
It's un-American. We are a nation of immigrants and those who were brought here as children and worked to fully contribute to our society have earned their place in it.
So we wholeheartedly support the Supreme Court decision handed down today that President Trump cannot end DACA -- Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals -- that protects these immigrants from deportation.
It is our hope, after the November election and when a new Congress is sworn in, that immigration reform will be a top priority and a path to citizenship is created for DACA recipients.
Once and for all.
ATTACKING WILDFIRES AND CLIMATE CHANGE
Wildfires are a reality for Western North Carolina, as many who were here in 2016 well know. We lost about 62,000 acres during a severe drought that fall.
We need to be better prepared for the next drought. To that end, the McDowell Community Wildfire Network has been created.
According to The McDowell News, “This is a partnership between local agencies including the city of Marion, McDowell County, Marion Fire Department, U.S. Forest Service, N.C. Forest Service, Mountain Valleys Resource Conservation and Development Council, the Nature Conservancy and others.
“The partnership was recently granted $40,000 from the Action, Implementation and Mitigation (AIM) grant program offered by an organization called Coalitions & Collaboratives, Inc. out of Lake George, Colo. This grant will support the partnership with program coordination, tracking mitigation activities, and acquiring mitigation equipment.”
You can read more about the partnership in this link, along with ways you can help prevent wildfires from damaging your home in the future.
Droughts are likely to become more common because of climate change. It is in our best interest in Western North Carolina to elect leaders who will actually listen to scientists and push for green energy and green technology to protect our environment.
We have too much to lose.
A JUNETEENTH TO REMEMBER
Last Friday was Juneteenth, the annual commemoration of the end of slavery in the United States. But this year it felt a little different, didn’t it?
There are still protests and marches in the streets across the U.S. over police violence against people of color. We are 155 years past June 19, 1865, when slavery ended in Texas, and yet there is still a need to speak out and demand equality.
So today, let’s speak out about the monuments across the country that celebrate Confederate war generals and other symbols of division. As petitions are submitted and heated arguments ensue in town halls and city councils everywhere, let’s remember on this Juneteenth what those monuments truly stand for and why they must come down.
The Confederate flag — that whole issue — was a battle to divide the country. It was a group of people that didn’t want United States. They wanted dis-United States. That was treasonous. So to have monuments glorifying this effort to divide the country, particularly knowing the message — what that conveys to a significant segment of the population — there’s just no sense in it.
This is an issue that should have been settled long ago, so it’s one that we need to settle. We ought to be focusing on issues that really matter, like getting healthcare and education. We ought to be focusing on those and not on honoring the past when that past is not something that was honorable.
So we support the efforts to remove the monuments and relocate them to an appropriate place that’s not public property.

APPLY FOR ABSENTEE BALLOT SOON
Given the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic and how it could impact voting in November, we are urging everyone in the 11th District to apply to vote by absentee ballot. You can go to this link for an application. You might want to wait until after Tuesday’s Republican runoff election to submit an application.
Voters have until Oct. 27 to request an absentee ballot, but we would recommend it be submitted well in advance so that the State Board of Elections isn’t inundated at the last minute and there isn’t any delay in getting the ballot back in time.
Reminder, you don’t have to vote by absentee ballot if you apply. But it is a great back-up if there are any disruptions and a reduction in polling locations due to the pandemic. Keep in mind that even if you apply now, you won’t actually receive an absentee ballot until September.
WE’LL KNOW OUR OPPONENT TOMORROW
The Republican runoff between Lynda Bennett and Madison Cawthorn will be held tomorrow, June 23, so we will finally know our opponent in the November election.
Not that it makes a difference. Republicans want to hold onto Mark Meadows’s old seat in Congress, and they have already spent $2 million to try to buy it even though the two candidates have no relevant experience for the job.
Don’t let them get away with it. Please.
We aren’t accepting corporate PAC money, so we need your contributions to fight for this seat.
Help us. Donate here.
Stay home. Stay safe. Stay healthy.

By some estimates, over half the U.S. prison population is comprised of nonviolent drug offenders – disproportionately poor people and people of color, most of whom posed little risk to the community when originally sentenced and certainly pose no threat today.
People in our prisons who can't practice social distancing or protect themselves from the coronavirus, are being infected at extraordinary rates, effectively sentenced to death for minor crimes.
Read my 4/20 op-ed in The Hill calling for an end to the War on Drugs and a new system of support for those who've borne the brunt of that failed policy.
""With prisons serving as COVID-19 hotspots, Congress needs to act to end the failed war on drugs"" -- Earl Blumenauer, Guest opinion, The Hill
As we are dealing with unprecedented upheaval and understanding of the flawed nature of so many policies and practices, the need for cannabis reform and urgent economic stabilization amidst this health crisis is a small but important opportunity to get the policies right, save lives, lower the cost of healthcare, and strike a blow for racial equality and personal freedom.

Donald Trump has always believed he is above the law – even before he was elected. But since Senate Republicans voted to leave him in office despite his crimes, he's pushed his authoritarianism to new heights.
He's punished war heroes who told the truth and followed the law.
He's attacked federal judges by name.
Yesterday, he pressured the Department of Justice to go easy on his friend, convicted criminal Roger Stone. Not long after, his Attorney General Bill Barr (who's never met a Trump order he wouldn't sell our country out for) obeyed, ordering the prosecutors recommend less jail time for Stone.
Disgusted by Trump and Barr's willingness to politicize justice, the entire team of prosecutors has resigned.
None of this happened behind closed doors, Alex. It wasn't subtle. Trump issued his demands on Twitter, for all the world to see. The DOJ has become a political tool for Trump to use as he pleases, and he wants everyone to know it. He's destroying our institutions and our democracy in plain sight.
And Republicans in Congress have the nerve to act surprised that Trump and Barr would abuse their power in this way. More than one has expressed ""concern.""
As if no one saw this coming.
Enough, Alex. This charade has to end. Republicans in Congress have no intention to hold Trump accountable or to set any limits on him. And at this point, none have the courage or the moral standing to even try. That's why I'm going to be campaigning with and fighting for Democrats across the country in 2020.
We've got to hold the House and take back the Senate this year, and we've got to fight with everything we've got. That means all of us. Please chip in $3 now to keep building the movement to end Republican control of our government in 2020.

In December, I voted to impeach Donald Trump because I saw overwhelming evidence of his efforts to obstruct justice and abuse the power of his office.
Then, I was proud to lead the effort to hold onto the Articles of Impeachment and not rush them to the Senate. The time allowed more information to come out.
This strategic move paid off. Since the start of the trial, even more - and more damning - evidence has steadily emerged.
Last week, Lev Parnas, a man at the heart of the impeachment inquiry (and whom Trump claims to not know) said that he was asked directly to sacrifice himself for Trump, and that Trump was unquestionably the driving force in the Ukrainian scandal.
Yesterday, we learned that the not-yet-published memoir of John Bolton,Trump's former National Security Advisor, includes several pages detailing Trump's plan to shake down Ukraine to investigate his political opponents.
There's no end in sight, Alex.
What will we learn tomorrow? Next week?
Each new item uncovered makes it harder for Republicans to justify their denial and rush to judgement. Even so, Mitch McConnell and the Senate GOP are still scrambling to cover up Trump's crimes.
They're seriously making the argument that jurors in one of the most important trials in our nation's history shouldn't hear any evidence.
If this isn't the greatest cover-up by a sitting president our country has ever seen, it's well on its way.
Our way forward? Win in 2020. Keep the House. Take back the Senate. Defeat Trump. Win back our country.
I plan to spend a lot of 2020 making sure they don't get a free pass. But I can't do it alone.
It's going to take all of us working together to restore the promise of government by the people, for the people. Our movement has to stretch from coast-to-coast, from Oregon outward. We built up some serious momentum in 2018. Now, we have to not just sustain it, but keep building it, all the way to November 3 – and beyond.
Donate today and let's take back our government.

Last week, my fellow Democrats and I laid out a way forward for post-Trump America.
We talked about values: compassion, democracy, justice.
We talked about action: universal health care, a Green New Deal, gun safety reform.
And we talked about bringing the reality of this country closer to our ideals, making government work for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-connected.
That means our movement needs to not only take back the White House and the Senate, but to protect and strengthen our majority in the House, Alex. Contribute now to make sure we've got what we need to win those fights!
This week, it's the Republicans' turn.
They're talking about one thing, and one thing only: fear.
On Monday night, we listened to one speaker after another work themselves into a frenzy, describing our movement as a ""vengeful mob that seeks to destroy our way of life, our neighborhoods, schools, churches, and values"" that will ""bring crime, lawlessness, and low-quality apartments into thriving suburban neighborhoods.""
That's not vision, Alex. It's a cynical, divisive, fear-mongering rant.
Yesterday, they doubled down, attacking the LGBTQ+ community, diplomacy, and truth itself.
We're not interested in hearing what they say tonight. The Trump era has written enough horror stories. It's time to close the book on them and build the progressive future our country needs.
Are you with me? Chip in $3 now and let's keep building this movement!

Last night, the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to impeach President Donald Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors against the Constitution and our democracy.
But Senator Mitch McConnell says he is ""not impartial"" and ""working in lockstep"" with the President's team.
That is not acceptable.
That is why I led the call to hold back the impeachment referral until Sen. McConnell agrees to adhere to the rules – and to do his job – by allowing a fair trial that upholds the Constitution. I am grateful to Speaker Pelosi and my House colleagues for taking up that call and holding the line on this battle for our democracy.
Add your name to tell Mitch McConnell: ""No kangaroo court for impeachment. Americans demand a fair trial.""
It's time for Senate Republicans to stop playing politics and uphold their oaths of office. It's time for Donald Trump to be held accountable.

Friend,
As a Navy SEAL who deployed five times to fight for our country, I am dedicated to keeping the American people safe. I’m continuing that fight now in Congress.
But radical Democrats are threatening the security of our country, advocating for open borders and defunding the police. Americans must wake up to the reality of far-left extremists winning in November: the safety of our communities is at stake.
That’s why we need to elect leaders who will fight for border security and support our law enforcement officers.
Border security is critical to national security. But right now, the radical-left is trying to undermine our border security, advocating for open borders, a return to catch-and-release policies and sanctuary cities.
Meanwhile, we are witnessing in real time the effects of Democrat governance. Radical calls to defund the police and constant demonization of law enforcement have resulted in a rise in crime that is tearing our communities apart.
Enough is enough.
It’s time we put the safety of our nation first. That’s exactly what my friend and colleague, Brian Fitzpatrick, is fighting for in Congress.
As a former FBI Agent, Brian knows how to keep the American people safe from all enemies, both foreign and domestic.
He is fighting to secure our borders, support our police officers, and keep our communities safe.
Brian stands for strong border security, including physical barriers and increasing manpower to go against not just drugs and guns from cartels, but also criminals and terrorists. And as a former FBI agent, Brian supports giving our law enforcement officers the resources they need to keep the peace and maintain law and order, and is fighting back against radical efforts to dismantle police departments.
And that’s why I stand with Brian.
We need his leadership in Congress as we fight to secure our border and keep our families safe.
Stand with me and support Brian’s campaign and tell the country we want a safe country.
This issue is too important to ignore.
We need action NOW

Friend,
Our country is facing a crossroads. The far-left extremists are calling to defund the police at a time when they need us most. The far-left simply does not understand.
They are threatening our law enforcement heroes in Bucks and Montgomery Counties and across our nation who protect us and keep us safe.
Defunding our police isn’t the answer.
Our communities need the police, they should be fully funded, and they deserve our utmost respect. This is why Brian has been working on bipartisan legislation to support our men and women in law enforcement, who put their lives on the line on a daily basis.
Stand with Brian and support our police!
Our community doesn’t want the far-left extremist “defund the police” policy, which would leave our communities open to a drastic increase in crime.
This just isn’t acceptable.
Sign our petition today to stand with Brian and say NO to defunding the police!

TRUMP PENCE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
BREAKING: Joe Biden picks PHONY Kamala Harris as running mate.
Alex,
Wow.
Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn't get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?).
Next, she ends her pathetic run at President.
Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP.
And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it's obvious that this radical duo is PERFECT for each other but WRONG for America.
They are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working tirelessly to restore LAW AND ORDER.
It's going to be up to Patriots like YOU to save our Nation from that dark fate, Alex. Election Day is right around the corner, and now that we know what we're up against, I'm going to do something HUGE:

TRUMP PENCE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Alex,
It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
For the sake of American strength, jobs, law and order, our lives, and our liberties, we must defeat this radical duo on Election Day. The stakes have never been higher, and we need your help to send a message that this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS.
For the NEXT HOUR, all contributions will be 600%-MATCHED!

Electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November would be a grave mistake for this Nation with irreversible consequences. They will raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators.
We cannot allow our Nation to go down that path, Alex.

Abigail Spanberger to vote to Impeach President Trump
This is ridiculous! After months of testimony, evidence, and witnesses, it’s clear that President Trump did not commit ANY crimes. Abigail Spanberger hates President Trump so much that she’s willing to do anything it takes to undo the 2016 Presidential election.
We deserve someone in Congress who doesn’t play political games just to score points from her donors. We deserve someone who is going to fight back against the Democrat’s radical agenda. We need Nick Freitas in Congress.

Today Senate Republicans voted to ACQUIT PRESIDENT TRUMP OF ALL IMPEACHMENT CHARGES!
This is great news after the countless impeachment conspiracy theories perpetuated by Adam Schiff and the impeachment-crazed Democrats. Now after MONTHS of witnesses, testimony, and transcripts we get the truth -- President Trump didn’t commit ANY crimes.

752,"Trump's numbers have come up
Four years ago, Wisconsin gambled on Donald [[URL REDACTED]] and we lost.
Bad numbers
Boy was that a bust! But even as the odds of a second Trump term continue to dwindle, a new Supreme Court decision to throw out mail ballots in Wisconsin that are postmarked by Election Day but arrive after November 3rd, makes it clear that although a Joe Biden victory is not guaranteed, collusion and cheating by Donald Trump, his Republican lapdogs, and now the illegitimate US Supreme Court, is. Will you help me stop it by helping me GET OUT THE VOTE IN WISCONSIN?
Contribute
We cannot place the same bet again.
A vote for Trump is a lot like playing the lottery. Your odds of winning are low, but your odds of losing are high. Play Trump’s numbers and see where that gets us:
226,000 \- The amount of Americans dead so far due to COVID-19
26 -The amount of women who have accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct
5,500 -The number of children separated from their parents at the US/Mexican border
7.9% \- The US jobless rate in September
8 \- The number of Trump associates arrested or convicted of crimes
$750 \- The amount of taxes Trump paid in 2016 and 2017
Donald Trump has gambled away people’s lives and livelihoods to enrich himself and to serve his personal and financial interests his entire life. And he’s played with house money to do so.
In a few days, we have a chance to reshuffle the deck and deal ourselves a winning hand with a Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ticket. But it doesn’t just stop at the Presidential race. To #WINsconsin, we have to max bet on BLUE and vote for every Democrat in every race, everywhere.

Alex,
I've never been a politically active person.
I was always wary of corporations and big money in politics, but I gave in to cynicism. I skirted by on voting once every two to four years, until recent events inspired me to take action.
Children were separated from their parents and forced into cages, right-wing terrorism and hate crimes soared, and foreign governments tampered with our democracy.
Meanwhile, I felt powerless, held down and kept out of protests because I relied on my job for healthcare and my next meal. Who could afford to leave work for justice when they had mouths to feed and tuition and medical debts to pay?
But this election cycle felt especially urgent, so I volunteered for Jessica Scarane.
Sign up to volunteer!
I am not a talker, but I signed up for a phone bank, and I signed up to canvass. Much to my surprise, doing so was the best thing I could have done for my mental well-being.
I'd spent so many years feeling alienated and believing that my friends and I were alone in a ""progressive bubble.” I didn’t know that things like Medicare for All, free public college, a living minimum wage, and a housing guarantee are such popular proposals.
I gave my time, and I got back more in return in knowing that we're not alone, that our goals are shared with others.
I have hope that if we just put in the effort to organize, then we can achieve something truly amazing.

Dear Friend \--
The war on drugs has been a disaster, leaving deep wounds in our society and around the world. Mass incarceration has skyrocketed, tearing communities apart and disproportionately impacting people of color. Prohibition policies have created an illegal underground drug market, fueling violent organized crime throughout the US and the world.
Billions of dollars have been squandered on misguided efforts to criminalize substance use issues, while the stigma created around drug use has contributed to a worsening crisis of opioid abuse and overdose deaths. The overdose death crisis, skyrocketing rates of overdoses, Hepatitis C and HIV have been driven by tainted substances and lack of access to safe use supplies.
The good news: we have solutions for these problems. We can end the failed, destructive drug war, and begin the road to recovery and healing.

❌HB 994 - The Gang Bill❌
I do not support gang organized crime. The reality is that gang prevention and intervention does not happen with stricter sentencing but rather with funding of programs like after school activities and education opportunities and reentry programs.
Despite bipartisan dislike of this bill from state DA's, this bill passed in the House. Georgia has the toughest gang law in the country already and this bill was an unnecessary act that only exists to further false claims of a nonexistent gang crisis within the state. This bill is based on scare-tactics and enforces a ""tough on crime"" approach that endangers minority communities by allowing law enforcement to categorize more crimes as gang-affiliated. This bill makes trying gang crimes harder for prosecutors, who now have to try three additional charges which require different sentencing to each crime for the same behavior, it also allows the state to categorize hindering a law enforcement officer as a felony offense, meaning talking back to an officer or fighting back when arrested can now be considered a felony in gang cases.

The Lopez Report: Week 8
This week at the capitol
How did your legislator vote this week?
HB 555 - This bill will grant access to juveniles who have been issued arrest warrants to a state appointed public child welfare case manager from the Department of Family and Children's Services. Voted Yes
HB 752 - This bill would requires that in order to receive their license, a physical therapists and physical therapist assistants must submit fingerprints to the Georgia Crime Information Center. Voted Yes
HB 444 - Dual Enrollment Budget Cuts
Governor Kemp said his budget cuts would exempt QBE school funding but that doesn't protect critical funding for other education programs.
This bill does not fix standing issues within the budget like the tax credits without analysis of its return of investment to our state, it only restricts opportunities to our students.
Those that voted green, voted to cut a successful program used overwhelming by women, people of color, and rural students.
From GBPI:
Dual Enrollment represents less than 1 percent of total public K-12 and higher education spending. Georgia has limited resources, yet chooses to forgo billions of dollars through tax credits and other breaks, with an unclear return on investment. Dual Enrollment’s benefits are shown through other states’ assessments of their programs, such as shorter time to graduation, increased postsecondary attainment, increased lifetime earnings and tax revenues, and decreased spending on social safety net programs.

👀 On the Lookout! 👀
❌HB 915 - Anti Sanctuary act \- This bill forces law enforcement, judges, localities and universities to collaborate with ICE. This bill is dangerous to immigrant communities!
* Forces law enforcement to comply with unconstitutional ICE hold requests, and prohibits them from requesting a judicial warrant
* Requires ALL local jails to contract with ICE/DHS to hold detained immigrants for ICE
* Forces judges to enforce transferring individuals arrested with ICE holds to ICE custody at the end of their sentence
* Also requires college campus police departments to comply with ICE, and allows campus police to keep tabs on a student's immigration status and send that information to ICE
❌ HB 994 - ""Street Gang Bill"" - This bill is based on scare-tactics and enforces a ""tough on crime"" approach that endangers minority communities by allowing law enforcement to categorize more crimes as gang-affiliated.
* This means that groups of three or more individuals can be categorized as a gang.
* This is pushing to lower the age for juveniles to be tried as an adult, which is already at 17.
* This bills expands the death penalty as well to ""gang related crimes"" as well.

_________________________________
State Representative Lopez Romero and her team have led a competitive race for Georgia's 7th congressional district in a year that has been full of unexpected, but most important clear rejection of being quiet to injustices from the child immigration detention camps to police violence against black men and communities of color. Rep. Lopez Romero states:
""These last few days have taken several twists and turns to be sure. Due to the irregularities and mismanagement of this election cycle, clear election results have yet to be finalized. It appears we may not have certified election results until later this week. But at the moment, it also appears that a runoff election may not occur.""
""I am about to walk into legislative session and just walked out of our streets as I protested and stated that #BlackLivesMatter, this impresses upon me how vital our work is and that there is still a great deal to do for our state and country. As I finish out my last term in the state legislature (for now), I will continue to fight for the hate crimes bill and justice-for-all legislation, push back against cuts to our education budget, and reform our state’s election laws so every citizen can exercise their sacred right to vote with ease and security. Furthermore, I will concentrate on supporting efforts to flip the 16 state house seats we need in order to prevent disastrous gerrymandering in 2021.""
""I am immensely proud of what my team has accomplished. Despite COVID-19 shutting down our grassroots efforts and person-to-person outreach, a heavily biased media, and pundits dismissing our people powered campaign from the beginning, we still ran a competitive race. We have shown that money and the status quo does not establish a candidate as a shoo-in nor does it make a candidacy viable and, rather, community outreach and hard work can (and should) make a difference.""
""I want to state unequivocally that I remain committed to the advocacy work that I have been doing for the last 15 years for immigrants, civil rights, and racial justice. I am excited to be working on a project to continue to provide opportunities for young people of color to be a part of the political and legislative process. Young people like the 28 legislative aides I was privileged to work with in the Capitol. Young people like the 10 campaign fellows who have been a vital part of our team. For them and for you, I will continue to work for a new generation of diverse grassroots advocates of color to run for office.""
""I am humbled every day that I continue to grow an endless list of individuals to whom I owe too much to ever be able to repay or be able to express my eternal gratitude. I also want to thank each person that has underestimated me, they also motivate me to work even harder for the young girl or boy who would otherwise be told not to dream big or dream at all.""
""No one is voiceless. Rather, there are those whose voices are always heard and those whose voices continue to be ignored. It is my goal to magnify the voices and perspectives of those who are ignored.""
Rep. Lopez Romero continues her work in the state Capitol and in our district and state. She awaits official certified election results from Gwinnett and Forsyth.

762,"Biden for President
JOE BIDEN’S AGENDA AND THE LATINO COMMUNITY
Joe Biden believes that the story of America is one of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. The Latino community is a core part of the American story and their contributions are evident in every part of society.
Joe Biden Statement:
Our nation’s ability to draw hard-working, aspirational people from every culture, from every nation is an indisputable strength. Our diversity is the source of America’s constant renewal — the reason we’ve been able to remake ourselves over and over. As president, Joe Biden will ensure everyone is treated with dignity – no matter their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disability. Everyone means everyone. Biden’s health care policy will ensure that quality, affordable health care is a right. Biden will raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour so that people can live with dignity. Biden’s investments in education will ensure that your income or zip code don’t determine your future. And Biden’s immigration policy will treat those seeking safety and a better life and those hiding in the shadows with dignity and respect.
Today, a full quarter of all children in the US are Latino. Our collective success depends upon the success of the Latino community. Biden has worked with and supported the Latino community for decades, standing shoulder to shoulder with President Obama to pass the landmark Affordable Care Act, strengthening worker’s rights and defeating the National Rifle Association to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines. Further, during the Obama years, the high school dropout rates among Latinos was reduced by more than half. The Administration’s economic recovery programs helped to slash Latino unemployment to 5.9% in 2016, down from a nearly 13% peak in 2009. And, Biden led the Administration’s Central America strategy, securing $750 million to invest in the security and prosperity of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, so fewer families would ever have to make the unforgiving journey north. Joe Biden knows the Latino community and they know him. He will be ready on Day 1 to implement the changes needed for the Latino community to thrive.
Biden is running for president to restore the soul of the nation and rebuild the middle class so that this time everyone comes along. As president, he will:
Expand Access to Quality, Affordable Health Care
* Nearly twenty million Americans gained health coverage under the Affordable Care Act – including more than 4 million Latinos, the largest gain in coverage for any race or ethnic group. Trump is attempting to rip that coverage away. Joe Biden opposes every effort to get rid of Obamacare – whether by Republicans or by Democrats. As president, he will protect and build on the landmark law by giving everyone an affordable public option. Biden’s plan lets individuals choose whether to use that public option or to keep their private coverage. Biden’s plan will lower premiums, and automatically cover the 5 million low-income Americans who would be eligible for Medicaid but for their state government’s refusal to expand it. And, he’ll double funding for the community health centers that so often provide care to undocumented immigrants. Biden will also restore funding for Planned Parenthood, which treats more than a half-a-million Latino patients.
Make Sure Latinos Have a Fair Shot at Joining the Middle Class
* Latinos are becoming an increasingly important part of our economy. Between 2010 and 2017, despite making less than one-fifth of the overall U.S. population, Latinos accounted for more than 80% of the growth in labor-force participation. But, many Latinos are stuck in low wage jobs and have lower rates of homeownership and wealth in comparison to non-Hispanic whites. Biden is running for president to rebuild the middle class so that this time, everyone comes along. He’ll start by increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, restoring overtime pay to millions of workers, and getting rid of non-compete clauses and unnecessary licensing requirements that make it harder to move to higher paying jobs. And he’ll continue his life-long fight for workers’ rights to form unions and bargain.
Invest in Education from Birth Through 12th Grade
* Joe Biden will make sure that every child in America – including nearly a quarter of K-12 students who are Latino – has the chance to realize their full potential starting at birth, regardless of their zip code, race, or family income. Biden will make pre-K available to every child and triple funding to Title I schools, giving teachers the higher pay they deserve and narrowing the gap between rich and poor districts. He’ll expand “community schools” that serve the needs of students and parents; and double the number of school psychologists, nurses, school counselors, and social workers, giving kids the support they need to grow. And, through partnerships between high schools, community colleges, and employers, Biden will make sure that all kids have a chance to graduate with an industry credential, ready to compete in the 21st century workforce.
Expand Access to Quality, Affordable Education and Training Beyond High School
* For too many, earning a degree or other credential after high school is unaffordable today. For others, their education saddles them with so much debt it prevents them from buying a home or saving for retirement, or their parents or grandparents take on some of the financial burden. But, roughly six in 10 jobs require some education beyond high school. As president, Biden will provide two years of community college without debt, and halve the cap on student loan payments to just 5% of discretionary income (that’s income, minus taxes and essential expenses, like housing and food) above $25,000. He’ll double the maximum value of Pell Grants, providing bigger subsidies to lower-income students and helping many middle class families for the first time. And he’ll make an unprecedented $70 billion investment in Hispanic- and other Minority-Serving Institutions, as well as Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Importantly, under his plan, DREAMers will qualify for these benefits for the first time.
Reform Our Immigration System
* It’s past time to overhaul our broken immigration system. As Vice President, Biden backed reforms that would have established a path to citizenship and when Congress failed to pass them, the Obama-Biden Administration created the DACA program to give DREAMers a chance to pursue their lives without fear of deportation. Biden also led the Administration’s work with Central America – securing $750 million to address the root causes of migration. We can secure our borders in a way that is humane and establishes a rational set of rules for aspiring immigrants. Biden will prioritize a comprehensive immigration reform that will finally give some 11 million undocumented immigrants a roadmap to citizenship. DREAMers are Americans, and Congress needs to make it official. He will invest in smart technology at our ports of entry and streamline the asylum system, hiring more immigration judges and asylum officers. He’ll ensure those seeking refuge in the United States are treated with dignity and get the fair hearing they’re legally entitled to receive. Moreover, a Biden Administration will immediately review every TPS decision made by the Trump administration and overturn all those that do not appropriately consider the facts on the ground. Additionally, Biden will extend TPS to Venezuelans seeking relief from the humanitarian crisis brought on by the Maduro regime.
Pass Common Sense Gun Laws
* Gun violence is a public health epidemic that shatters lives in schools and neighborhoods nationwide. But Trump is hiding from the problem – and soliciting political help from the NRA. Biden is the only candidate who has taken on the NRA and won — twice – passing Brady Bill background checks and a 10-year ban on assault weapons. He’ll beat the NRA again. Biden will enact legislation requiring background checks on all gun sales, closing other loopholes in our background check system, and keeping weapons of war off our streets. He’ll also support survivors of gun violence by funding school counselors and create a network of trauma care centers to help survivors heal.
Protect Communities of Color from Environmental Impacts and Ensure Polluters Pay
* Climate change poses an existential threat to our public health, economy, environment, national security and economic well-being. And Latinos and communities of color are disproportionately impacted by the climate emergency and pollution. It’s wrong – and Donald Trump is not only denying the problem, he is rolling back existing regulations to benefit his pals and donors in polluting industries. In contrast, Joe Biden has been fighting against climate change for decades, introducing the first related bill in the Senate in 1986. Now, he’ll invest $1.7 trillion in building a clean-energy economy, creating 10 million good-paying jobs and ensuring that the communities most harmed by environmental injustice benefit first. But the United States is only 15% of the problem, so he’ll also rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, and rally the world to increase their climate targets. Biden will take action against fossil fuel companies and other polluters who put profit over people and knowingly harm our environment and poison our communities’ air, land, and water, or conceal information regarding potential environmental and health risks. And, he’ll hold polluters and their executives personally accountable for threats to clean air and drinking water.
Reduce Incarceration and Make Our Communities Safer
* Today, too many people are incarcerated in the United States – and too many of them are black and brown. Joe Biden will strengthen America’s commitment to justice, reduce both the prison population and violent crime, and root out the racial, gender, and income-based disparities in the system. As president, Biden will spur states to shift from incarceration to prevention. He’ll eliminate mandatory minimums for nonviolent crimes and get rid of cash bail, so income doesn’t determine how long someone is in jail. He’ll invest $1 billion a year in juvenile justice reform; decriminalize cannabis; and end incarceration for drug use alone, diverting people to drug courts and treatment, and expanding access to mental health care. His Justice Department will prioritize the prosecution of hate crimes; and Biden will continue his life’s work of supporting survivors of violence, helping them to rebuild their lives.

764,"We Need YOU To Help Pass Hate-Crimes Legislation
Friends,
Thanks to your calls for racial justice in our state, we are just a few steps closer to finally passing a hate-crimes bill into law! While a state senator did try to poison the bill with an irrelevant and unnecessary amendment, they has since reversed course. Georgia is one of just a small handful of states that have yet to pass hate-crimes legislation. As the tragic deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and Rayshawn Brooks and the resulting demonstrations have shown, our marginalized communities in Georgia deserve and demand real hate-crimes legislation.
Finally, we have a clean hate-crimes bill that will help us better understand and combat systemic and racial injustice in our state. I have spent my career fighting alongside advocates and activists against discrimination and standing strong for equity. If turned into law, HB 426 would not only be a great victory for civil rights advocates throughout our state, but it would be a great victory for all Georgians in the pursuit of justice.
Call your Senator today!

Tell them to vote YES on HB 426 as amended by Senate Rules Committee
We are so close, but we can't take any chances. NOW is the time to help! Our community needs YOU!

Friend,
On January 17th, 2017, over 5 million people worldwide turned out to protest the inauguration of President Donald Trump. The Women’s March was the largest single day protest in the entire history of the United States.
Since that day, women have only dug in harder, organizing in grassroots efforts to bring affordable healthcare to people, protect voting rights, create prison reform, enact common sense gun laws, bring attention to the murders of indigenous women across the US, and the epidemic of black trans women being killed in hate crimes at alarming and consistent rates.
Women have always been at the forefront of advocating for justice, and this year’s Pioneer Valley Women’s March is a reflection of the strength, leadership, and community here in Western MA I am honored to support and be a part of it.

Alex,
This year has shown Michiganders what our priorities are. Our family, our freedom, and our financial security have become more precious to us than ever. They have also been threatened like never before.
Before you vote this November, ask yourself who you trust on these four fundamental issues:
* Who do you trust with your job security and getting the economy back on track?
* Who do you trust to fight for the safety and security of your families?
* Who do you trust to uphold First Amendment rights to free speech and free expression for ALL Americans?
* Who do you trust to love this nation and fix it—rather than dismantle and destroy it?
That is what’s at stake this November.
We’ve seen the Democratic vision for America these past months. Violent crime running rampant, Americans silenced by censorship and economic devastation across the country. We cannot let that be our future. We cannot give the mob a mandate this November.
TAKE ACTION
We will recover from this as a stronger nation, but we need Republican leadership to make that possible.
We want to make sure that hardworking small business owners have a future and their boarded-up businesses can re-open and prosper.
Higher taxes and burdensome regulations proposed by the Democrats will crush resilient Michiganders and the future of our country.
As your Representatives, we know that Republicans win on the economy every time. We win on keeping your families safe, championing free speech, and leaving your money where it belongs: your pocket.
CHOOSE AMERICAN PROSPERITY
We believe that this American comeback will make us stronger than ever. We want to lead a Michigan where ALL people can enjoy the prosperity of the American Dream.
Help us win in November!
We’re Fighting For You,
Michigan Republican Congressional Delegation

Alex,
I am deeply saddened by the horrible “Defund the Police” movement that has taken over some parts of our country.
Our brave men and women in uniform deserve respect and appreciation for risking their lives every day to keep us and our communities safe.
STOP THE DEFUND THE POLICE MOVEMENT
DEFEND THE POLICE
Our police officers are good people, they work hard to make us all feel safe, and it is not right to drag them through the mud for the horrid actions of a few.
Unfortunately, this year, the crime rate has spiked and police suicides are increasing, while recent violence across the nation, including Portland and Chicago, shows why we need to appreciate the hard work of the men and women who protect us from lawlessness.
We must DEFEND our police and thank them - not get RID of them!
STAND WITH THE THIN BLUE LINE
We must stand together as one people, united, against violence and anarchy. Our officers need our support. Will you help me show our Thin Blue Line that we stand with them and oppose defunding the Police?
SHOW YOUR SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT
Thank you,
John Moolenaar

Trump's corruption was on full display at the RNC:
[1] He broke campaign laws by giving his RNC speech from the White House
[2] The GOP tricked non-supporters into appearing in propaganda videos

JUSTICE FOR BREONNA TAYLOR: DEMAND THE INVADING OFFICERS ARE CHARGED WITH MURDER ➞
We need you to remember this name: Breonna Taylor.
Breonna Taylor was an award-winning EMT and First Responder from Louisville, KY who risked her own health and safety to serve her community during Covid-19. Her life mattered.
Breonna Taylor
But Breonna was murdered by the Louisville Police Department at her home while sleeping. They barged in without identifying themselves to look for drugs that were never found and for a person who did not even reside in Breonna’s residence.
Breonna’s life was stolen. But the three police officers who invaded her home are STILL gainfully employed and have yet to be arrested and charged with murder.
The only person who was charged was Breonna’s boyfriend, who shot at the door in self-defense when the officers refused to identify themselves.
We’re beyond disgusted at this horrific disregard for Black life. So we’re calling for justice.
We won’t rest until these offenders are held accountable for their crime. Sign on to demand the invading officers are charged with the murder of Breonna Taylor →
JUSTICE FOR BREONNA TAYLOR: DEMAND THE INVADING OFFICERS ARE CHARGED WITH MURDER ➞
Black Americans, especially Black essential workers like Breonna, deserve the right to sleep peacefully in their own home, free from harm.

Donald Trump
At the RNC, Trump said he's ""done more in three years for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years.""
Let’s check the facts:
\-- He called African nations “sh*thole countries”
\-- He’s told Black Congresswomen to “go back to the crime-infested places of which they came”
\-- And he won’t do ANYTHING to stop police brutality.
So we need EVERY good Democrat to join our fight to END Trump’s racist attacks. We're $27,094 short of our goal to fuel this fight. Donate $5 to stop Trump’s racist attacks now >>
For decades, Black Americans have risked everything to fight for equality.
That fight is FAR from over.
Police are still taking innocent Black lives.
And Trump won’t do anything to help. He’ll just spew racist lies.
The President will not do the right thing unless will force him. We need $45,000 to fund our campaigns. Every dollar will go to electing Black Democrats who will stand up to Trump’s racism.
But if we miss this goal, Trump will continue to ignore us.
So please, don’t wait another minute. Rush $5 to end Trump’s racist and bigoted attacks on Black Americans >>

779,"BREAKING: Thousands call for immediate resignation of Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis and County Sheriff David Beth after brutal attack on Jacob Blake
Jacob Blake is innocent. But that didn’t stop Kenosha police officers from shooting him 7 times in the back for no reason.
With Daniel Miskinis and David Beth at the helm, there will NEVER be justice for Jacob Blake.
That’s why we’re demanding their immediate resignation. We need 100,000 activists signatures, sign now >>
JUSTICE FOR JACOB BLAKE: DEMAND THE POLICE CHIEF AND SHERIFF RESIGN IMMEDIATELY >>
justice must be served.
Jacob Blake was shot 7 times in the back while getting into his car. He was shot in front of his three small children. He spent the following days in the hospital fighting for his life.
“Dismantling systemic racism in our nation starts with demanding justice & holding offenders accountable.”
\-- Kamala Harris
Jacob Blake is innocent. But his innocence couldn’t protect him from the horrors of police brutality. Just like it couldn’t protect George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and countless more.
What makes this all even worse is that Kenosha cops were seen cozying up to white supremacists in the ensuing protests. Their racism runs deep.
We know that as long as Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis and Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth remain in their positions, there will NEVER be justice for David Blake.
So we’re calling for their immediate resignation in protest of racist police brutality.
We won’t rest until these offenders are held accountable for their crime. Sign on to demand the police chief and sheriff in Kenosha RESIGN →
JUSTICE FOR JACOB BLAKE: DEMAND THE POLICE CHIEF AND SHERIFF RESIGN IMMEDIATELY >>
Black Americans deserve the right to get into their own car, free from harm.
This is an injustice that cannot be ignored. And it will take an army of grassroots activists like you to finally be taken seriously.
Sign your name to demand the immediate resignation of Daniel Miskinis and David Beth >>

Trump escaped impeachment simply because the GOP saved his hide.
But in the impeachment trial, we saw hard evidence that Trump obstructed justice.
So Kamala Harris, speaking as a former prosecutor, is simply trying to uphold the law. Trump is not above the law and he must be held accountable.
But charging an ex-President (even one as CORRUPT and CRIMINAL as Trump) is controversial, so we need to gauge support among informed Democrats.

790,"homicides are up by double-digits in major cities across America this year – and it’s a wake-up call that our country can’t afford the Left’s agenda
Claudia for Congress
Friend,
This year has devastated so many communities across America, and the situation is only being made worse by Democrats who are terrified of facing the facts about their failed leadership.
We need to address what’s going on in our major cities right now.
* Homicides have risen by double-digits in 36 out of America’s 50 largest cities so far this year.
* Recent polls show that 77% of Americans are concerned about rising crime in our cities.
Democrats know why this is happening, but they’ll never admit that they’re the reason!
The Left’s radical crusade against law enforcement is taking a devastating toll on lives and communities across our country, and it will only get worse if we don’t stand up to their anti-police agenda before it’s too late.
CHIP IN TO RESTORE LAW & ORDER THIS NOVEMBER
Our men and women in blue are watching our communities fall apart right now, and they’re calling for backup from Washington – but Democrats like Anthony Brindisi refuse to answer the call!
That’s because Brindisi is more loyal to Pelosi than he is to our police departments, our district, and even the voters who supported him in 2018!
That’s why the New York State Troopers PBA just endorsed our campaign. They’re sick and tired of being abandoned by Congress, and they’re counting on us to change that.

Friend,
New campaign ads. New endorsements. New quotes from top Democrats that you have to read to believe. This week on the campaign trail had it all. Here’s all the top headlines to catch up on from this week before you head into the holiday weekend!
⬇️ TOP HEADLINE FROM THIS WEEK ⬇️
These Veterans Aren’t Taking Brindisi’s BS in Our Latest Ad
Brindisi’s BS
America’s military veterans deserve more than cheap lip service from career politicians – but that’s all Anthony Brindisi has to offer them. Instead of fighting for veterans like Brindisi promised back in 2018, he’s only fought for Nancy Pelosi’s America-last agenda, and our vets have paid the price ever since.
Watch the ad and chip in to keep it going!
United We Stand with the Remington Arms Workers’ Union!
United We Stand
Remington Arms isn’t just the oldest gun manufacturer in the country still in operation – it’s a cornerstone of our local community, an important piece of our nation’s history, and an institution that our district can’t afford to lose. I’m honored to have earned this endorsement, and I’m ready to get back in the fight for Remington Arms from Washington!

Once Again, Cuomo Chooses to Divide – Instead of Choosing to Lead
The Divider
Governor Cuomo called President Trump the “worst president in history” and said that he “better have an army” if he ever plans to return to New York. Cuomo has never been more out of touch with Upstate New York voters than he is now, and it’s time for him to focus on the real issues at hand – rising violence, crime, and anarchy in NYC!

Pelosi’s Blow-Out Doesn’t Go As Planned
LOL
Pelosi’s hypocrisy was on full display this week after she was seen getting a blow-out at a San Francisco salon without wearing a mask – and according to Pelosi, it was all a “setup” by the salon owner to damage her reputation. Brindisi’s boss doesn’t deserve two more minutes in Washington – much less two years!

792,"Anthony Brindisi is working hard to let lawlessness and crime take over our district. Not on my watch.
Claudia for Congress
Friend,
Americans in big cities across the country are suffering under the weight of rising crime right now, and it’s easy to see why.
Democrat mayors in charge of Seattle, Chicago, and New York – just to name a few – have abandoned their police officers and let lawlessness, looting, and violence take over their cities.
Now, Anthony Brindisi is working with Nancy Pelosi to let lawlessness take over our own district by voting to defund the police and voting to release dangerous prisoners early.
Not on my watch.
This is just the tip of the iceberg of failed Democrat leadership – and it’s only going to get worse if Brindisi, Biden, and Pelosi win on November 3rd and take over Washington.
That’s why I need to know where you stand.
Friend, the rising crime that we’re seeing across the country right now could have all been avoided – but Democrats chose to sit on the sidelines and do nothing to stop it.
America can’t prosper without a strong rule of law and strong police departments to keep us safe, and that’s why I’m running to strengthen law & order starting right here in NY-22.
With just 77 days to go until we cast our votes, I need to know that you’re with me on this issue.
What will you choose on November 3rd?

National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day
Law Enforcement Appreciation Day should be recognized every day in our communities. We are thankful for the sacrifices made by those who answer the call to serve in this noble profession. Political leaders in Albany have enacted dangerous laws under the guise of reform that put our communities and those who serve at risk.
Sadly, towns and cities within New York’s 22nd Congressional District have been ranked among the most dangerous in New York in terms of recent crime rate statistics. Politicians in Albany and Washington must act now to repeal and amend those laws to protect our citizens and law enforcement officials, not put them at greater risk.

With America in crisis, President Trump and conservatives in Congress have worked hard to prioritize solutions, provide relief, and support our small businesses.
Nancy Pelosi and her pals, like our own Anthony Brindisi have been using this same time to push their unpopular, radical agenda.
They’re out there promoting things like the green new deal, demanding reparations and tax cuts for their millionaire pals. They’re calling for “crimes against humanity” charges against President Trump.

This is NOT the time for radical tactics and partisan policies. Our families and our business are at stake! Our hospitals and health providers are fearing the worst and our small businesses are struggling.
There is NO EXCUSE for pushing these unpopular Democrat priorities when people are truly suffering.

Friend,
It’s official: President Trump just nominated Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court!
Amy Coney Barrett is a proven defender of religious liberty, life, and the Constitution, and that’s exactly the type of justice that we need on the bench at a time like this when America is at a crossroads.
And just like clockwork, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and the rest of the Swamp are obstructing her confirmation with threats of another baseless impeachment against President Trump for the crime of performing his Constitutional duty.
Friend, you and I both know where Anthony Brindisi stands on impeachment.
Claudia for Congress
Brindisi has never been more out of touch with Upstate New York and his record proves it.
His values don’t represent the values we stand for and his agenda doesn’t come close to addressing the real problems we’re dealing with on a daily basis in our district.
It’s time to strengthen our police departments, work alongside President Trump to move America forward, and create jobs right here within our own communities.
We’re running out of time to make that happen.
Election Day is just 38 days out – but our quarterly fundraising deadline is only four days away and I need your help to prove to Brindisi that our grassroots team is still stronger than Pelosi’s blank checks.
Everything we do right now can make or break this fight for NY-22’s future.

Once again, the Christopher Columbus statue in Utica has been vandalized by radicals who would rather trample on our history than learn from it. We must create a better future for our nation and that starts with taking an honest look at our past – not vandalizing or trying to rewrite it!

797,"In Albany, Governor Cuomo and far-left Democrats are letting criminals go free after passing sweeping bail reform. What do you think?
Claudia for Congress
Friend,
Every day, there are new stories of dangerous criminals who are now roaming the streets thanks to dangerous bail reform policies implemented by Anthony Brindisi’s closest ally in Albany, Governor Cuomo and the out of control Democrats in Albany.
So far, robbers, murderers, and drunken hit-and-run drivers have been set free under bail reform. Unsurprisingly, many of those released have committed more crimes.
This issue affects everyone in New York, so we need to hear from you directly.
Sign our petition if you oppose New York’s short-sighted, dangerous bail reform law!
Add your name!
Instead of trusting New York’s law enforcement and judges, liberal Democrats in Albany upended the criminal justice system with soft-on-crime bail reform. As a result, these criminals’ victims and the general public are at risk, and the authorities responsible for holding them accountable have been constrained.
The General Assembly rushed to craft dangerous, headline-grabbing reforms instead of working with law enforcement officials to craft a policy that would make public safety a top priority. The future of our state is at risk thanks to short-sighted and dysfunctional actions in Albany.
Because this policy is so dangerous, we need signatures from 5,000 New Yorkers by midnight!
Do you oppose New York’s failed bail reform?
Add your name!
It’s time to stand up to the dysfunction in Albany! Make your voice heard on bail reform now: [[URL REDACTED]]

Friend,
From launching new ads, to meeting more voters across the district, backing the blue, and watching the Democratic Party’s National Zoom Convention, it’s been a massive week for our campaign – and our country. Here’s the top headlines that affected our race this week:
⬇️ FEATURED HEADLINE OF THE WEEK ⬇️
Brindisi Failed NY-22’s Cops – Hear it Straight From Them in Our Latest Ad!
Brindisi Failed
Officers Murphy and Salce said it best – Anthony Brindisi failed to do his duty, he only serves his party, and he only protects Nancy Pelosi. These police officers know exactly what’s at stake in this election, and our campaign needs your help to spread their message to every corner of NY-22 over the final 74 days of this campaign.
Watch the full ad and chip in to keep it on the air.
Ending Qualified Immunity would Bankrupt Cops – and Brindisi would Profit From it!
B.S. Brindisi
Brindisi’s efforts to undermine law enforcement are extreme – but they aren’t new. Brindisi has been working for years to expose police officers by stripping away legal protections of qualified immunity. National Review revealed this week that if he’s successful, he and his inner circle would receive tens of thousands in lobby donations – another brick to add to his wall of fraud.

Voters across the district know exactly what’s at stake in this race – and they’re doing everything they possibly can to protect the future of every man and woman who faithfully defends the thin blue line in our communities.

Biden’s Record of Failure was on Full Display at the DNC – and Brindisi’s Ready to Back It Up 100%
Biden-Brindisi
Joe Biden wrapped up the Democratic National Convention last night by outlining his plan to raise taxes, drive businesses off our shores, and put the needs of violent protesters ahead of our police. Anthony Brindisi is all-in on his radical agenda just like he was all-in as a Hillary delegate back in 2016 – and it’s our job to stop it in November.

President Trump Marks 100 Years of the 19th Amendment in a BIG Way!
Susan B. Anthony
This week marked the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment which gave women the right to vote – and President Trump honored the legacy of Susan B. Anthony by pardoning her for her crime of voting. That history has roots right here in our district as the first women voted in Lisle, and I commend President Trump for this decision!

Friend,  in a time of crisis, Americans should be coming together…
And in so many ways, we are. I’ve seen great things from our communities and our great businesses working to help one another in this time of need.
But in Congress - you don’t see that - not from the partisan liberals like Nancy Pelosi and Anthony Brindisi, anyway.
They’re not using this time to remember their duties or patriotism, they’re using it to push a partisan, anti-Trump agenda, NO MATTER WHO IT HURTS.
And it’s time to say ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
I AGREE: TELL LIBERALS IN CONGRESS TO GET TO WORK >>
Anthony Brindisi should be fighting for New York right now. We’ve been hit HARD by the Coronavirus and our community, our healthcare workers, and our small businesses are truly struggling.
But instead of fighting for THEM, he’s looking to earn favor with the radical elites who are out there promoting things like the green new deal, demanding reparations and tax cuts for their millionaire pals, and calling for “crimes against humanity” charges against President Trump.
This hyper-partisan game playing has passed the point of offensive and entered the territory of pure madness. It’s time to send our own message on behalf of the people of NY-22: ENOUGH IS ENOUGH - Congress needs to get to WORK for US!

800,"The Swamp is threatening another baseless impeachment against President Trump – and we already know where Brindisi stands on that issue
Claudia for Congress
Friend,
It’s official: President Trump just nominated Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court!
Amy Coney Barrett is a proven defender of religious liberty, life, and the Constitution, and that’s exactly the type of justice that we need on the bench at a time like this when America is at a crossroads.
And just like clockwork, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and the rest of the Swamp are obstructing her confirmation with threats of another baseless impeachment against President Trump for the crime of performing his Constitutional duty.
Friend, you and I both know where Anthony Brindisi stands on impeachment.
Claudia for Congress
Brindisi has never been more out of touch with Upstate New York and his record proves it.
His values don’t represent the values we stand for and his agenda doesn’t come close to addressing the real problems we’re dealing with on a daily basis in our district.
It’s time to strengthen our police departments, work alongside President Trump to move America forward, and create jobs right here within our own communities.
We’re running out of time to make that happen.
Election Day is just 38 days out – but our quarterly fundraising deadline is only four days away and I need your help to prove to Brindisi that our grassroots team is still stronger than Pelosi’s blank checks.
Everything we do right now can make or break this fight for NY-22’s future.
Can I count on you to help us finish this quarter strong and send our campaign into October with the wind at our backs?

These past few weeks have been busy for our campaign. We’ve held Anthony Brindisi accountable on impeachment, received endorsements from some of the biggest names in the Republican Party, participated in the Fidelis Care Stuff the Bus drive, and more.
Anthony Brindisi Votes “Yes” on Impeachment
Anthonhy Brindisi
This week, Anthony Brindisi and the do-nothing Democrats impeached President Trump. Our district elected Trump in 2016 by over 15%, but Anthony has supported impeachment at every step of the process. He has betrayed the hard-working people of Upstate New York.
Brindisi Votes to Kick Millions off Medicare
Bridisi Votes to Kick Millions off Medicare
One day after voting for impeachment, Anthony Brindisi voted against opposing a government takeover of healthcare that could kick millions of American seniors off Medicare. We deserve better than the false promises of Anthony Brindisi.
Endorsed by Kevin McCarthy, Minority Leader in the U.S. House of Representatives
Kevin McCarthy
A couple of weeks ago, I was endorsed by Kevin McCarthy, Minority Leader in the U.S. House of Representatives. He has a proven track record of delivering real results for this country, and he knows I have what it takes to beat Anthony Brindisi in 2020.
ICYMI: Other Major Endorsements
Steve Scalise
A few weeks ago, I was endorsed by Republican Whip Steve Scalise. We have also received endorsements from major groups in the Republican Party including the Oswego County Republican Committee and Winning For Women. Republican leadership and conservative groups are paying attention to this race because we have a real shot at taking this seat back from Anthony Brindisi and liberal democrats.
Stuff the Bus Toy Drive
Toy Drive
Last week, I took gifts to the Stuff the Bus Drive hosted by Fidelis Care in Utica. It’s a great cause that brings our community together and something I look forward to every year!
Dysfunction in Albany on Bail Reform
Albany Bail Reform
Bail reform signed into law by Governor Cuomo has been disastrous for our state, and showcases the dysfunction in Albany. Their plan isn’t even fully implemented yet, but each week there are new stories of dangerous criminals back on the streets committing more crimes.
House Passes United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
Unites States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
Yesterday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Anthony Brindisi and Democrats in Congress prioritized impeaching the President over passing USMCA all year costing Upstate New York millions of dollars and putting the state of our dairy farmers at risk. I am glad to see the provisions I fought so hard for including those for our dairy farmers and small businesses included in this USMCA package and I am glad the President will finally sign the agreement.

Friends,
Ever since Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats seized control in the House of Representatives, they’ve done nothing but abuse their power to further their witch hunt.
While my Democrat opponent votes to impeach the President with no evidence of any crime, I’m running for Congress to solve real problems.
We have real problems facing our nation --- including a broken healthcare and multiple never-ending wars --- but instead of working with our President to develop solutions, they are only interested in obstruction.
This farcical impeachment is such an embarrassment that a Democrat member of the Senate left the hearings early to go train for an upcoming triathlon, according to a D.C. columnist.
Democrats are running from the truth.
Can you imagine a world where the Democrats hadn’t won control of the House chamber in 2018?
Here’s what I imagine:
* No impeachment hoax
* More tax cuts for the middle class and small business
* More badly needed funding to secure our borders and fight illegal immigration
* Pelosi, AOC and Schiff would be an amusing sideshow, not the drivers of the national policy debate
But as is usually the case, the midterm elections are a backlash against the sitting President.
My opponent, Jared Golden came in on that wave and even voted to impeach President Donald J. Trump despite everything we know about the lack of evidence and total inversion of reality by the Democrats.
Over a month ago, I and some of our supporters delivered petitions to Jared’s office calling him to reverse course on impeachment of the President. He did not listen to his constituents and it’s time for him to go.
The great news is that the 2020 election will be a different story with President Trump on the ballot. He won this district by 10 points.
We can win this seat back. I am giving this race my all. But I cannot do this alone.
I need your support to win this battle for Congress. Can you make a donation of $10, $25, $35 or even $100 to help us Free America and President Trump?
Our team is all over the 2nd District talking to Maine people to let them know that the message of Liberty, low taxes, healthcare freedom and the end of burdensome regulations can win.
Please join the fight with me and we won’t have another 2 years of this impeachment hoax nightmare.
Free Maine,
Senator Eric Brakey
P.S. We are making great strides to taking back this seat. But I cannot take my foot off the gas now. Can you make a donation of $10, $25, $35 or even $100 to help us Free America and President Trump?

Eric Brakey for Congress
Fellow Conservative:
Jared Golden’s decision to impeach the President is an insult to the people of Maine’s 2nd District. We elected Donald Trump to root out corruption and Drain the Swamp — and his only crime is following through on that promise.
Let’s be clear, Jared Golden is supporting impeachment. His announcement today is another example of trying to have his cake and eat it too — but there is no halfway between serving the Maine people and serving party bosses in Washington. You can't halfway remove a President from office. It’s not like we would get to keep him on weekends and holidays.
We deserve better.
As Northern Maine’s next Congressman, I will always put the Maine people first and Washington politics dead last.
And with the end of the quarter coming up at the end of this month I am asking you to please step up and chip in a donation of $25, $35, $50, $100, $250, $500, $1,000 or more to help my campaign get all the resources it needs to go up against the Democrat Machine.
Jared is trying to serve Pelosi, Schiff and Nadler while appearing that he is serving the people of Maine’s 2nd District too, but we are not fooled.
This is why we have over 1,500 signed petitions to deliver to Jared’s office today in Lewiston. There is still time to sign and to join us if you can make it.
This impeachment is a total inversion of reality and I will personally be in Lewiston to deliver that message.
What the facts actually point to is that former Vice President Joe Biden abused his power to give his son Hunter a very lucrative position with a Ukranian gas company and then obstructed justice by ordering the firing of a prosecutor in that country who was investigating the Biden's corrupt arrangement.
Biden is on video bragging about threatening to withhold $1 Billion in aid to the country if the prosecutor was not fired the same day that he was demanding it. What the Democrats in Congress, including Jared Golden, are doing is projecting Joe Biden’s admitted crimes on to President Trump, pure and simple.
Jared Golden will officially sign on to this Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler created impeachment scam today by voting for one of the articles on the floor of the U.S. House.
This is despite Maine’s 2nd District voting for Donald Trump overwhelmingly -- a 10 point margin in 2016. Yet Jared Golden is perfectly willing to vote to reverse those results, which shows contempt for the voters in his own district.
We cannot afford another term of Jared Golden, democrat majority and the endless witch hunts of President Trump, which is why I’m running to replace him in 2020.
As a state senator I was an independent voice for the freedoms and paychecks of Maine people who put principles first - not the lobbyists and the whims of party leadership.
I will bring that same dedication to principled leadership to Congress and will always fight for Free Maine and Free America.
Free Maine,
Senator Eric Brakey

Friends,
The double standards we are seeing from the Washington political class is a betrayal of the American people and should land many of them behind bars.
The inversion of reality from the left is stunning, but not totally unexpected.
Joe Biden proved once again over the weekend that he has no problem trying to cover up the corruption that he, his family and his Democrat cohorts have engaged in by projecting it onto President Trump.
Biden has done and continues to do everything that the President is being accused of.
On Friday, Biden bragged about his plans to refuse to comply with a subpoena, should the US Senate issue one for his testimony in an upcoming impeachment trial. He was forced to backtrack via Twitter on Saturday, but his original statement shows his contempt for any kind of due process in this sham impeachment.
I know Maine people are fed up with Biden’s corruption and are ready to drain the swamp.
The good news is we are ready to win this race for Congress in 2020\.
We can win Northern Maine and take back the House of Representatives to end the witch hunts and get on with the business of restoring this country.
That’s why I’m asking for your help. With just over 24 hours left before the end of the Quarter, we’re very close to hitting our $20,000 goal. Please consider a donation of $25, $35, $50 or more if you can afford it.
Getting President Trump elected was a great start towards rooting out corruption in D.C., but he can’t do it alone.
The Democrats have proven that simply talking about investigating their crimes is worthy of an unprecedented impeachment. They are so desperate to hold on to power that they’ll destroy the Republic if we don’t fight back.
I fought and won battles for Constitutional Carry, Right to Try, and Welfare reform in the Maine Senate. I can win these same kinds of battles in Congress, which is exactly what I plan to do when you send me to Washington.
Please help our campaign’s momentum going strong into 2020. If we reach our $20,000 fundraising goal by midnight on December 31st, we’ll be over $500,000 in total fundraising. Every dollar counts, so please consider a donation to help us reach our goal.
Joe Biden thinks that he can get away with the massive corruption in the Ukraine involving himself and his son Hunter by blaming it all on President Trump. He thinks that this partisan impeachment will keep the heat off him and give the Democrats their wish by overturning the 2016 election.
When you send me to Washington, I will expose the guilty parties and demand that they be brought up on charges for their crimes. Anything less will continue to put our Republic in peril and at the mercy of the radical left.
Free Maine,
Senator Eric Brakey

Friends…
Yesterday, the people of Maine's second district spoke loud and clear when we delivered boxes of petitions to Jared Golden's office demanding he stop this partisan witch hunt against President Trump.
Unfortunately, our voices were ignored and Golden voted to impeach the president. This, after it was learned that the Obama Administration’s FBI submitted inaccurate, incomplete, or unsupported by appropriate documentation to the FISA courts to obtain a warrant to spy on the Trump Campaign. Golden’s vote is an insult to the Maine people, and only proves he is serving the Pelosi liberals and not the people of Maine.
If the Democrats are wanting to root out corruption and abuse of power, they simply need to look each other in the face.
Can you help our campaign fight this corruption by chipping in $25, $50, $100 or even $250 right now?
It appears that the only “crime” committed by the President was taking on a corrupt system, and now that same system is fighting back. Golden siding with that corrupt system and ignoring corruption in his own party only strengthens our resolve to take back Maine's 2nd district seat.
As Northern Maine’s next Congressman, I will always put the Maine people first and D.C. politics dead last.
Will you join me in that fight?

Friends,
Our firearm rights are under assault.
As the Washington establishment pushes for targeted gun confiscation without due process through “Red Flag” Gun Confiscation Orders, Virginia’s Democrat Governor is taking the gun control agenda to new extremes — threatening to order the national guard to seize firearms and imprison those who don’t comply.
As the author of Maine’s Constitutional Carry law, I've been winning fights against the gun grabbers for years. I’m running for Congress to send a message: “Our 2nd Amendment is not up for negotiation.”
As soon as Democrats took control of government in Virginia, they leapt into action to destroy the 2nd Amendment.
At the urging of one of their largest donors, NYC billionaire Michael Bloomberg, Virginia Democrats introduced bills to:
* Seize guns from anyone deemed to be “dangerous,” with no due process or a conviction
* Ban guns in public places

* Limit handgun purchases
The gun control movement stopped pretending they weren’t coming after our guns. That’s why 30,000 American protested in Richmond this Monday. And that’s also why we need to elect champions to fight back.
I defeated the gun grabbers in the Maine Senate, and I’m running for Congress to defeat them again in Washington.
I will fight until my last breath for our Constitution, and I need your support to win this battle for Congress. Can you make a donation of $10, $25, $35 or even $100 to help us Free America and defend our gun rights?
The people of Virginia are standing against the gun grabbers in their state capital. We can join the fight by standing against the gun grabbers in in our nation’s capital.
In the Maine Senate, I passed Constitutional Carry to ensure all law-abiding people in Maine have the right to keep and bear arms — without a government permission slip!
Garnering nearly 100 co-sponsors — including Democrats, Republicans and Independents — I even managed to get my Democrat opponent to sign on...
… at least until Michael Bloomberg’s money started flowing into local anti-gun interest groups, then Jared Golden joined the gun grabbers and voted against Constitutional Carry three times!
So we passed it without him.
Gun control groups said Maine would become the Wild West. After five years of Constitutional Carry, Maine is ranked the safest state in America with the #1 lowest violent crime rate.
We beat “Jared and the Gun Grabbers” to pass Constitutional Carry, and we are going to beat them again in November.
Maine deserves a champion. I’ve won countless battles for our 2nd Amendment in Augusta, and I’m ready to take the fight to Washington.
Please donate today to send a proven champion to Congress and put a stop to the assault on our 2nd Amendment rights.
The people of Virginia are standing up. Let’s stand and fight together.
Free Maine,
Senator Eric Brakey

Dear Friend,
For those of you who haven't joined in our gun raffle for the Maine-made VEX SS from Wyndham Weaponry, you have less than one week to enter!
Supporters who sign up to be a monthly contributor by 11:59 p.m. on Saturday February 29th will be automatically entered to win this rifle. Sign up here to enter.
We are seeing the political left race to pass ""Red Flag"" or gun confiscation bills all over the country, from state house to state house, just in 2020.
They are using any tactic they can to destroy the 2nd Amendment and due process while they are at it. The worst part is that members of Congress are actually encouraging them to do it.
They want to take your guns, but I want to give you one!

The people of Northern Maine know that I will do whatever it takes to protect the 2nd Amendment when I get to Washington. I led the charge for gun rights in the Maine Senate with my successful Constitutional Carry bill, but I know the fight is far from over.
My opponent, Jared Golden, didn't stand with me on Constitutional Carry. He opposed protecting the right to self defense of Maine people. We passed it without Jared, and now Maine is now the safest state in the nation, with the lowest violent crime rate.
Gun rights are human rights and my opponent is out of step with Northern Maine.
Please don't hesitate to sign up as a monthly contributor to help us send Jared packing. Consider a monthly donation of $25, $50 or even $100 to give us the resources we need to win this fight.
You must act soon, because the deadline is 11:59 p.m on February 29th.
The gun grabbers in D.C. know that if we take back control of the House it will severely cripple their planned gun confiscations through ""Red Flag Laws,"" ""Universal Background Checks"" and ""Assault Weapons Bans.""
They're afraid because they know our message is resonating. They have shown their cards and can no longer claim that they're not coming for your guns.
If the 2nd Amendment falls, our entire Republic is in jeopardy.
Help me win this fight today by becoming a monthly contributor. You have less than a week left!
Together, we will win the fight to take back Congress and protect the 2nd Amendment.

Friend,
I want to thank everyone who attended the Waldo County GOP Straw poll for the great showing of support I received.
I am honored that a majority of those present cast their votes of support for our campaign to #FreeMaine and #FreeAmerica. It was an informal poll, but we ended up with 59% of those in the room supporting us and a double digit victory.
I also want to thank both of my Republican primary opponents. They each had supporters present who believe in them, and for good reason.
I have worked with each of them over the last decade in service to the conservative cause, and I respect their accomplishments.
Their willingness to put their names forward in this race for Congress is a credit to them.
Over the last eight years, I have had the tremendous honor to work side-by-side with thousands of grassroots Maine Republicans, winning many great victories for freedom.
I want to take those successes and bring them to Washington. We need all the resources we can get to wage this fight against the political establishment.
Please consider a donation of $35, $50, $150 or even $250. We will make the most of every single dollar!
Like our President Donald Trump, I came into the Maine Republican Party like a wrecking ball. At the age of 23, I helped lead a broad grassroots coalition of Ron Paul Republicans to victory in the 2012 caucuses and convention.
Many of those who came into the party with me that year are some of the most active members of the Maine GOP today.
For my part, I’ve been working to unify our party and win conservative victories often thought unwinnable. Together, we passed constitutional carry and reformed welfare.
Together, we defeated “Red Flag” Gun Confiscation laws and the National Popular Vote.
In 2018, I had the honor to help lead the GOP as our U.S. Senate nominee, and 2nd district Republican activists ranked our campaign the most exciting race at the top of the ticket.
I’m running for Congress today to #FreeMaine and #FreeAmerica. To accomplish this, we must unite Maine Republicans to defeat Jared Golden and take on the big challenges ahead of our American union.
Our healthcare system is broken; our federal government is $23 trillion in debt;
Our gun rights are under assault;
Our men and women in uniform are still fighting the 18th year of a missionless war that never ends halfway across the world;
and the corrupt power establishment that created this mess is going after the President we elected to fire them. We have to stand up for ourselves.
I believe we can fix healthcare by firing the bureaucrats and putting patients and doctors back in charge;
I believe we can control spending by restoring constitutional limits to our federal government;
I believe we can defeat “Red Flag” Gun Confiscation orders in Washington with the same grassroots might we used in Augusta;
I believe we can stand up for our soldiers to secure them a clear mission or a plane ride home;
and I believe we can hold the corrupt power establishment accountable, prosecuting those who have committed crimes.
There are four months until primary day. We have a lot of work to do.
If there’s one thing I can tell you for certain about this race, it’s that we have a great chance to win and help take back the House. Please consider a generous contribution today to keep us on top.
Our grassroots supporters are out in the snow knocking doors. Our message is hitting mailboxes and televisions. And I am personally working everyday to earn your support.
We inherited the torch of liberty from our Maine ancestors, who set it aflame in the American revolution. Now the responsibility falls to us (as past generations have done), to kindle the flame and pass it forward.
We have real challenges ahead of us, but the future need not be so dark if we can keep our torch of liberty burning bright.
Free Maine,
Eric Brakey (R-ME)

P.S. This is a very winnable race. The incumbent Jared Golden continues to show that he is out of step with our district, including voting to impeach President Trump. It’s time to send Jared packing.

Friend,
It looks like we are going to see finally some justice in the premeditated entrapment of General Michael Flynn. And that is great news for the Republic.
But don't expect an apology, not from CNN or MSNBC.
And not from the likes of the DOJ's James Comey, Robert Mueller, Andrew McCabe, Lisa Page or any of the Russiagaters who promoted this dangerous hoax all over social media.
With the vindication of Michael Flynn, we must pursue and expose the malfeasance of officials at every level of the of Justice Department.
Now that Flynn's case was dropped by the DOJ, we should start to see the term #Obamagate everywhere, with an all-important question:
What did President Obama know and when did he know it?
When you send me to Washington, I will fight for justice at every turn in this #Obamagate scandal.
Can I count on your donation of $25, $35 or $75 today?
DONATE
Friend, if you missed it, documents released last week right before the dismissal of the Flynn case showed that the F.B.I. agents were setting up Flynn before their infamous interview and had written plans to ""get him to lie.""
This is outrageous!
The FBI knew he was innocent before that interview. They set him up to get him out.
The real target was President Trump and they used the Flynn case as a weapon against him.
The Deep State never rests. And my well-funded opponent will be getting big dollars from Soros, Bloomberg, and groups that have propped up the Russiagate hoax.
They took control of Congress in 2018, and now it's time for us to take it back.
It's time to boot out all the Bloomberg-and-Soros-funded cronies that helped Democrats take over, like my opponent Jared Golden.
Your donation of $25, $35 or even $100 will ensure that our campaign reaches key voters across the district with the message that this injustice will be exposed. Can I count on your support today?
DONATE
It's clear now more than ever that political bias was at the very heart of the persecution of Gen. Flynn. The Obama holdovers in the F.B.I. wanted him out of Trump's administration.
They were willing to do whatever it took, including altering documents and even threatening his son to force him to plead guilty to lying.
Frankly, those admissions are terrifying.
And the crimes that were committed to frame Michael Flynn in order to down the President cannot go unpunished.
If there's one thing I know about my opponent, it's that he will remain silent in the face of the abuses by the F.B.I, while I will fight for justice in this quickly unraveling fraud on the American public.
We must rebuild trust in our institutions and punish the guilty to #FreeMaine and #FreeAmerica.
Please join with me by donating today.
Sen. Brakey (R-ME)
P.S. It's going to take a significant fundraising effort to defeat my well-funded opponent Jared Golden. A donation of $25, $50 or even $150 will go a long way to winning in November. Thank you.

Dear Friend,
In these unprecedented times, our campaign is picking up new supporters and volunteers, attracted by our message of freedom and liberty in response to the virus.
Whether you've been with me since I first ran for office, or just signed up after one of our Facebook live events, I want to share a bit more in-depth who I am and why I'm running.
When you have a few free moments this weekend, I'd ask for you to please take 30 seconds to forward this email to 10 friends or family who may be interested in joining our campaign, but who we're not likely to reach on social media.
For those of you who are new, let me tell you a bit more about me.
I believe in a Free Maine and a Free America.
I am a proven conservative champion who gets things done, defending our constitutional freedoms, and our hard-earned paychecks.
As a 10th generation Mainer, I believe in the “Way Life Should Be.” That means the freedom to work hard, help our neighbors, and tell big government to mind its own business.
As a state senator, Eric Brakey fought for liberty on issues large and small, like helping a 6th grade class legalize hedgehogs as pets
In the Maine State Senate, I reformed welfare to protect taxpayers, passed Constitutional Carry to restore our gun rights, and fought for Healthcare Freedom by passing Right to Try to ensure “we the people” make our own life-or-death healthcare decisions, not federal bureaucrats.
I’ve worked hard to restore our freedoms, whether it’s addressing small issues (like working with local 6th graders to legalize hedgehogs as pets), or tackling complex issues (like reforming the healthcare bureaucracy).
I know together we can take power back from Nancy Pelosi and the socialist Democratic Party -- but I need your help.
You see, our President is under constant attack from the DC Swamp, and Democrats like my opponent are embracing radical leftist policies like we’ve never seen before.
They pursued a lawless course of action on impeachment and started our nation down a road to socialism from which we may never recover if we don’t fight back now.
I want to help America get back on the road to freedom, and that’s why I’m running for US Congress in Maine’s 2nd District.
A little over three years ago, President Trump won this district by 10 points.
But in the so-called ""Blue Wave,"" socialist Democrat Jared Golden shocked this state and narrowly won. And predictably, he’s been supporting a Big Government Agenda in Washington ever since.
If defeating Golden and his Leftist cohorts in Congress is enough motivation for you, feel free to sign up by clicking here.
But if you need more convincing, let me tell you a little about my record and my plans in Congress.
When I first ran for Maine Senate in 2014, they told me I couldn’t win.
As a young Republican running in a blue district against a 36-year incumbent Democrat, it shocked the political establishment when I won in an 18-point landslide.
And with the support of freedom-loving Mainers, look at what we were able to accomplish together in the Senate:
● WELFARE REFORM \- As Chairman for the Health and Human Services Committee, I sponsored and passed legislation to end the use of welfare dollars to buy alcohol, cigarettes, and lottery tickets.
I fought for work requirements on able-bodied adults to ensure folks are encouraged and not penalized when they strive for independence off the taxpayers’ dole.
● HEALTHCARE \- In the era of Obamacare, I couldn’t stand by and watch as the D.C. Swamp ripped away our fundamental healthcare freedoms -- and that’s why I worked tirelessly to pass Right to Try.
Eric Brakey authored and successfully fought to pass Maine’s Constitutional Carry law. Eric will always stand for our 2nd Amendment rights, and work to expand our freedom of self-defense.
Washington bureaucrats have no right to tell patients they can’t try certain medications to save their own lives, so I passed a bill to nullify the FDA’s authority within our state borders on this issue.
● 2ND AMENDMENT \- With the support of grassroots conservatives across this great state, I led the charge to restore our gun rights by authoring and passing Constitutional Carry.
Now, all law-abiding citizens of Maine can legally carry a concealed handgun without a government permission slip.
And despite the dire predictions of gun grabbers that this would “turn Maine into the Wild West,” Maine is now the safest state in America \-- with the #1 lowest violent crime rate nationwide, four years in a row.
As a freshman State Senator, I accomplished so much for the people of Maine that even the liberal Portland Press Herald titled me ""Rookie of the Year.""
The American Conservative Union ranked me the ""most conservative"" member of the Maine Senate.
And despite warnings from the political establishment that I would lose re-election in my Democrat-leaning district for sticking to my conservative principles, I won even bigger the second time.
In our state senate, not only was I able to bring people together, I was also willing to stand alone against bloated budgets, corporate welfare, and the nanny state taking our money and telling us how to live.
Now I want to take my record of campaign and legislative success to Washington.
And I’m asking that you join my team today -- so we can get a head start on this huge task of taking on Democrat Jared Golden.
Eric Brakey fought for us in the state senate, while Jared Golden votes in lock step with leftist Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez..
While I was fighting to get our state on the right track in the State Senate, my opponent did the opposite in the State House, whipping votes to drag the Democratic Party to the Left.
Voting in lockstep with Democratic leadership, Jared Golden:
● Voted to allow welfare dollars to be wasted on alcohol, cigarettes and lottery tickets while expanding welfare for non-citizens.
● Sided with federal bureaucrats over sick patients, voting against their Right to Try potentially life-saving drugs.
● Opposed our gun rights and voted three times to defeat Constitutional Carry.
Now that he’s in Congress, my Democrat opponent has been just as terrible -- voting with socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Speaker Nancy Pelosi 86% and 82% of the time respectively.
This is simply unacceptable. We deserve better.
That’s why I’m running: to be a real champion for our Maine values, liberty, and the Constitution.
While our campaign is growing and remaining positive in unprecedented circumstances, we cannot let up now.
My platform is simple:
● Protect our 2nd Amendment rights. We must reject the sweeping gun-control measures being brought forth by leftists exploiting tragedies.
● Fight to repeal regulations hurting Maine jobs. From our lobstermen to our nursing homes, regulations by unelected bureaucrats are crushing us. I will work to rein them in.
● Fix healthcare with freedom, not socialism. I will work to personalize healthcare, empowering patients to directly access their doctors and cutting out the bureaucratic middlemen standing in our way.
● Defend our President. The Democrats threatened the very fabric of our democracy with their lawless impeachment, and we need to stop their witch hunts against our president.
● End the cycle of dependency by reforming welfare. Current laws penalize citizens trying to get back on their feet. We can bring the progress we’ve made in Maine to the rest of the nation by reforming welfare and eliminating welfare cliffs.
● Support our veterans. We must bring our troops home from Afghanistan, and keep the promise to address challenges -- like PTSD -- faced by my veterans when they return.
I will always stand for freedom, and stand with the people of Maine. I need your help to bring my message for a Free Maine and Free America to the voters of our district.
Can I count on you to join my team today?
Will you join our campaign to Restore Freedom and Defeat Socialism?
We're in uncharted territory responding to the coronavirus.
We want to be sure we can communicate with folks via email, as we likely cannot reach them at their doors any longer.
Reaching voters through email and mail will be crucial. And mail can get expensive. So I ask is that you please sign up for updates.
Eric Brakey stands with our veterans.
For those of you who are able to pitch in financially during these tough times, I pledge to spend every dollar wisely -- to continue to build the grassroots movement online that will carry us to victory.
We must stay vigilant, and get everyone involved to get past this crisis, and to defeat Jared Golden.
Maine’s Second Congressional District promises to be one of the most competitive districts in the country.
With your help we can win. I am excited to hear from you that you’ll be a part of our team, so please get back to me as soon as possible.
Thank you in advance for your support.
Free Maine,
Sen. Eric Brakey (R-ME)
Candidate for U.S. Congress
Maine’s 2nd Congressional District
P.S. Our campaign for Congress to Free Maine and Free America is off to a strong start. My opponent is a vulnerable, freshman Democrat, who has voted consistently with Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez!

Friends,
Every June, we celebrate Pride month here in Colorado and across the country. It's a time to lift up the LGBTQIA+ community and activists who have fought -- and continue to fight -- for their right to full equality under law.
And this June in particular, we must remember that the first Pride was a protest against discrimination, bigotry, and police brutality. Pride is certainly a time for celebration and parades, but until everyone in the LGBTQIA+ community has the same rights and protections as everyone else, it will also always be a national protest against inequality and injustice.
When President Obama repealed Don't Ask, Don't Tell, I was proud to stand up with him and for Colorado values at the 2012 Democratic National Convention -- but we still have a ways to go. Victories like this week's landmark Supreme Court decision have been hard-fought. From marriage equality and hate crimes legislation to federal nondiscrimination protections, the LGBTQIA+ community has continued to face violence and discrimination throughout their decades of activism.
And still today, too many members of the LGBTQIA+ community -- especially BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) transgender women -- experience high rates of violence. It is vital we address this often deadly prejudice head-on and ensure that all Americans have the support and protections they need to not merely survive, but thrive.
Join me in honoring the activists who ignited the movement for equality, and recommit to combating injustice against the LGBTQIA+ community. Add your name now to pledge to keep fighting alongside them every step of the way towards full, lived equality in this country >>
Happy Pride,
Jason

814,"A Message from Laura Ahearn for State Senate
[[URL REDACTED]]
Dear Fellow Supporter,
First and foremost, I hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy.
My name is ​Laura Ahearn and I am a Democrat running to represent us in the New York State Senate in Senate District 1, in Suffolk County. In June, I won a five way democratic primary and voters are energized for the November 3rd election. ​Let’s not let COVID-19 stop us from being heard. Now more than ever we need your support and your vote.
We are seeing first hand that the government only functions effectively with experienced and focused leaders who are truly committed to the values we represent and to public service, not politics.
I was born and grew up in Suffolk County, raised in a single parent household where my mom worked full-time to put food on the table and also attended school full-time to build a better future for herself and for her children. My mom taught me to be a fighter and that overcoming adversity builds character, shapes who we are, and teaches us resilience. This is one of the many reasons why I have dedicated my professional career to advocating for our most vulnerable. I graduated from Stony Brook with a Masters Degree in Social Work and founded The Crime Victims Center/Parents for Megan’s Law, a not-for-profit victims’ and community rights organization that provides services to child and adult victims of sexual assault, victims of domestic violence, gang violence, hate crime, and to the elderly and veterans. For over 20 years, I have worked to prevent crime and provide help to those in need in Suffolk and across New York State. While running the organization I went to law school at night and obtained a law degree to fight more effectively for our most vulnerable and for our community.
I am running for State Senate because right now we need a fighter with proven leadership skills, not someone like my opponent who is just looking to advance themselves politically. We need someone who has spent her whole career giving help to those who need it most. As we come out of this pandemic so much work must get done.

815,"At every turn, Attorney General William Barr has abdicated his responsibility to this country. He has been complicit in this president’s lawlessness.
Plain and simple: William Barr must resign.
Barr’s list of malpractice is long, but nothing is more damning than what happened this week.
Acting as a political puppet for the president, Barr intervened in the case of Roger Stone – a Trump ally who has been convicted of many felonies – calling for prosecutors to shorten his sentence. In the face of blatant corruption, most prosecutors withdrew from the case, knowing that the fix was in.
No one should disrespect our institutions the way William Barr has, let alone the Attorney General of the United States.
No official who is willing to be complicit in the crimes of the president, or willing to make it easier for the president to commit corrupt offenses should hold power. That’s not how our institutions are supposed to work.
No more lawlessness in this country. We must hold those in power accountable.

China’s utter lack of transparency and total mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak has cost so many lives, tens of millions of jobs in the United States alone and left massive economic destruction in its wake!
That’s why I’ve called for a Congressional investigation into the origin of the virus, but whether it started in a Chinese lab, at a disgusting Chinese wet market or somewhere else, the communist Chinese officials who hid what was happening need to be held accountable for their crimes against humanity!
So, today, I introduced a bill in Congress to hold China accountable and make them pay back the American taxpayers for every dollar we have spent combating this invisible enemy!
We will do this by withholding payments on debts owed to China until the full cost is repaid to American taxpayers! If you agree that we must make China pay, please sign our petition ASAP:
SIGN THE PETITION
I won’t stop fighting until the Chinese government is held accountable for their failure in managing this outbreak. Your support is critical to getting this bill passed and recovering taxpayer dollars from the communists in China!

We are reaching out to thank everyone who helped us meet our fundraising goal for the month of August! As a result, we are in a good position to fight off national Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from trying to flip our community's seat blue.
More than 4,000 individual donors donated last month, and I can’t thank our supporters enough for making this possible!
KEEP UP YOUR SUPPORT
Yet with a little over two months to go until the election, September will be our biggest challenge yet. I completely understand if you weren’t able to make a contribution in August for a host of reasons, but I am asking that you please consider making a donation this month if you can spare a few dollars.
Having the far-left win in our district would mean their weak stance on crime and immigration would come to our community. It also would likely mean a massive tax increase on all of us.

I know it is Labor Day weekend, so I’ll keep this short…
The stakes couldn’t be higher in this election. An Open Borders + Defund the Police platform would only exacerbate the violent riots and crime that have skyrocketed in 2020.
I am on a mission to stop this, and I know what it takes to do so. I came within an inch of my life fighting to defend our nation in Afghanistan, and I will continue fighting with everything I have in Congress!
Patriot, to help me in this important mission, I am asking for a $5 contribution this weekend. This will help us buy yard signs, distribute literature and fund TV ads.
But most importantly, it’ll help us fight back against the destructive mob that my opponent is egging on. She even went as far as to publish a hit list of Republicans that could be targeted during an “open season” of violence.
That is beyond the pale, and we can’t let her win. So, do you think you could take a couple seconds this weekend to make this contribution and help us defend the greatness of our nation?

Nancy Pelosi just ordered articles of impeachment.
Yet again, extremists in the House of Representatives continue to fail the American people. They refuse to recognize there was no collusion, no obstruction, and no crime.
While they focus on trying to remove a duly elected President, critical issues go unaddressed: lowering the cost of healthcare, stopping drug cartels and human trafficking, expanding trade opportunities for American companies and workers, and passing a budget to fund our military.
Now, more than ever, we have to stand up. I’m calling on every Team Van Duyne supporter to make your voice heard and donate whatever you can right now, to send a message that we will not stand for Democrats putting propaganda and partisan games ahead of progress for the American people.

Alex Brown,
Across the country, we are seeing cowardly politicians bow down to the liberal mob and abandon their fundamental responsibility to protect people by defunding their police departments. Following Los Angeles County slashing $145 million from the Sheriff's Department - targeting the gang unit, human trafficking, crimes involving children, rape, and major crimes bureau, New York City's Mayor De Blasio went further and gut-punched the NYPD with a billion-dollar cut as shootings and violent crime surges.
Instead of supporting these foolish policies of defunding our police, we must defend our police departments and the vital public safety they provide our families. Will you stand with me in defense of our courageous officers who are putting their lives on the line every day?
Stand with our Police
In our district, we even have a leading liberal candidate inciting violence and calling for rioters to ""Burn it to the ground.""
These statements to defund our police and burn our communities to the ground are no longer a fringe argument. Public safety or protecting our citizens and businesses isn't remotely a priority in the eyes of the extremists who run the Democrat Party.
I need your help today to stand against these destructive policies, will you join our campaign to support public safety for our families and communities with a $10 donation?
DONATE $10 >>>
With your help, we can continue to push back the extremist mob and remind folks how vitally important the men and women in blue are to the health, well-being, and safety of our children, families, and communities.

Before President Trump even took the oath of office, Democrats made it their mission to destroy his presidency. They had an agenda and hard core partisans placed in our intelligence community to take unprecedented and illegal actions in order to manufacture an investigation of ""crimes"" and ""collusion"" that never  existed.
A string of recently released documents has confirmed the entire Russia-Trump investigation, which eventually entrapped General Michael Flynn, was an extraordinary abuse of power and an organized effort by liberals to nullify the results of the 2016 presidential election. It was, in effect, an attempted coup.
Help reveal the truth about the liberal coup >>
These deep state bureaucrats think they run this country because Liberals and the media empower them. This is far more insidious than standard party-line politics. Our country's most valuable intelligence and law enforcement organizations cannot have a party affiliation or agenda. Please add your name to our list to help stop the weaponization of our intelligence community so this never happens again.
Don't let dems empower our intelligence community!
It is easy to get overwhelmed and tune it out, fall behind, or accept the national media's dishonest reporting. The ongoing revelations about the targeting of Michael Flynn can't be ignored. No matter how high this may go, the American people deserve to know who initiated this abuse of power and what they did to carry out their mission to destroy the Trump presidency, even as it was just getting started.
DONATE >>>
As your Representative, I will be a first line of defense to expose and stop these destructive acts from occurring. As Texans, we won't tolerate this abuse of power. With your support TODAY, we can continue to expose, and bring to justice, those who think they are above the law and above the people of our great nation!

Across District 24, folks will be seeing our first TV ad, and I wanted to make sure you saw it!
The ad focuses on the work I did as Irving Mayor, and a city councilwoman, to coordinate our police force with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to take illegal immigrants, who committed crimes in our city, off the streets, and out of our country. Plain and simple: when criminal illegals commit crimes, they must be deported.
As a result, we cut the crime rate citywide. Irving had the lowest crime rate 9 years running and was named one of the top 10 safest cities in America. We were also one of the fastest-growing cities in the nation.

Sen. John Cornyn: How we can police our communities better
Reforms at the state and local levels will be the biggest drivers of change.
By John Cornyn
As published in the Dallas Morning News.
Facebook Twitter
Alternate text
Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., center, accompanied by from left, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, [[URL REDACTED]], and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., speaks at a news conference to announce a Republican police reform bill on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, June 17, 2020, in Washington.(Andrew Harnik)
The killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis was a brutal, senseless and avoidable tragedy, and one our country has witnessed countless times before. In many ways, his death was the match that ignited nationwide conversations about the racial injustices that have existed in our country for generations. These systemic problems have led to inequalities in everything from education, to health care, to housing, and while each of these must be addressed, the most important place to start is with police reforms.
In a recent poll conducted by The Washington Post and George Mason University, nearly 70% of Americans agreed that Floyd’s death was a sign of broader problems in the treatment of Black Americans by police. While there’s widespread agreement that change is needed, there’s no consensus on what that change should look like. In order to get there, it’s important to listen and learn from a variety of voices.
Over the past few weeks, I’ve teamed up with the mayors of both Dallas and Houston to host roundtable discussions with law enforcement, faith and community leaders. During our conversation in Dallas, Sheriff Marian Brown said, “We have to reach a point where we are comfortable having uncomfortable conversations.” Whether in Congress, workplaces or homes, these discussions aren’t easy, and for too long the topic has been avoided altogether. But progress can only happen if we’re having these important conversations and following up with action.
Reforms at the state and local levels will be the biggest drivers of change. This is where decisions are made about hiring, data sharing and day-to-day police activities. By and large, that’s a good thing — a one-size-fits-all rulebook would create more problems than solutions. But there are basic practices that should be standard across the board, and Congress has a responsibility to ensure all police departments are transparent, accountable and well-trained.
In the Senate, I’ve worked closely with Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., in developing the Just and Unifying Solutions to Invigorate Communities Everywhere Act to reform, retrain and restore trust in America’s police officers. This legislation helps end chokeholds and addresses no-knock warrants, two practices which — for good reason — have been brought into question by recent events. It ensures our officers receive critical de-escalation trainings, properly use body cameras, report critical data and are held accountable for mistakes. This legislation also improves minority hiring in police forces, orders a top-to-bottom review of our criminal justice system, and makes lynching a federal crime.
It takes a number of steps to deliver both immediate and lasting changes in communities across the country, and last week, the Senate took a routine procedural vote to begin working on this bill. Those voting yes – as I did – agreed to start the process of discussing, debating and amending this police reform bill. This wasn’t a vote to pass the bill, or preclude any changes, just a simple, straightforward step to get the process moving.
Unfortunately, Democrats blocked the bill. They prevented the Senate from even debating this legislation by claiming it was “inadequate.” They refused to negotiate, offer amendments, or try to engage in any meaningful or productive way. When given the opportunity to follow their calls for action with actual progress, they chose to simply vote “no.”
It was a disappointing show of priorities and a tremendous loss for our country, which is hungry for reform. Despite this setback, however, I will continue to press forward and encourage my colleagues to pass the sensible reforms we all agree are necessary.
During a roundtable discussion in Dallas a few weeks ago, Police Chief Renée Hall discussed how policing strategies over the years have created a wedge between law enforcement and their communities, and we’re going to have to work to fix it.
I don’t claim to have all the answers, but I’m confident that stonewalling the Senate will not lead to progress. Every person — regardless of skin color, political party, age or background — must be willing to do the work. This uncomfortable national conversation is long overdue, and it’s time we seize this opportunity to create real reforms. Instead of accepting “no,” it’s time to demand, “yes.”

Friend,
Nancy Pelosi’s impeachment effort has been wrong for our country from day one. It was a rushed process. It was an incomplete process. It was a process that identified a punishment, then searched for a crime… It was a complete circus, and Nancy was the ringleader.
The Democrats have been at this charade for years. First it was Russian collusion, then obstruction of justice, then campaign finance law abuses and then violations of the “Emoluments Clause.” In each case, these outrageous accusations turned out to be untrue. Yet Democrats only looked harder for another excuse.
Now, we find ourselves heading into an official trial which could result in President Trump’s expulsion from office. Having tried every other trick in the book, the Democrats have now pushed our Constitution to the limit.
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… As someone who served as a district judge, state Supreme Court justice and Texas Attorney General and now sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, I want to know…
* What happened to the presumption of innocence in all this?
* While Democrats say no one is above the law, why can’t they point to the law they think the President violated?
* What happened to fundamental fairness? The House sat behind closed doors and concentrated all control in the hands of six Democratic committee chairmen. Where is the fairness?
As your Senator, I will be called upon to respond after House Democrats have rushed to impeach the President. That day has arrived.
Chuck Schumer and Liberal interest groups are already stepping up efforts to pressure me. They want to use impeachment as a tool to beat me and turn Texas blue.
But friend, I won’t budge.
I will start with the presumption of the President’s innocence. I will neither be sucked in nor fan the flames of wild rumors and political accusations.
The next few days represent a critical moment for America, and I need to know that you’re with me as I stand firm as the firewall between outrageous partisanship and the Constitution of the United States.

Friend,
Imagine your town, but with Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer in charge…
The Liberal Mob runs rampant through your streets.
Your local police force is defunded and reduced to nothing.
Leaving no one to defend you from the crime spewing out of our wide open borders.
You can’t see your doctor anymore because of Medicare for All.
And your friends with well-paying energy jobs? They’re now unemployed thanks to the Green New Deal.
This is the future the Radical Left wants for us. They want to bring it to Texas, and they want to bring it quickly.
But friend, one man stands in the way of these dangerous leftists: John Cornyn. He’s fighting to keep Texas red. To defend the Senate majority. To keep our president in the White House.
But he needs your help, friend. In just a few days, he’ll hit an all-important deadline… the August End of Month deadline. He needs YOU to do anything you can to boost his fight. Will you chip in immediately?

She won’t fight for Texas like my friend John does, friend… she’ll just help force the Radical Left’s agenda through the Senate. After all, they’re the ones bankrolling her campaign.
Friend, if you chip in RIGHT NOW, I’ll even see that your donation is TRIPLE MATCHED, so you can make your dollar go three times as far in the fight against the Liberal Mob.
Will you chip in immediately to unlock your 3X MATCH, help Senator Cornyn BEAT his goal, and keep our state safe from the liberal threat?
Time is running out, friend. We need to be quick here!

Friend, following up on Senator Cornyn’s email.
Need evidence of what’s at stake this election? Look no further than cities run by Democrats across the country.
Chaos and crime has filled the streets of Portland, Seattle, Atlanta, and Chicago... to name just a few. The Left's response: “these are peaceful protests.”
Friend, there is nothing peaceful about vandalizing small businesses, there is nothing peaceful about intimidating homeowners, there is nothing peaceful about stealing.
We need to stand up. We need to be UNITED. We need your help.
Last week Democrats raised a lot of money. We need to answer back.
For a limited time, to celebrate Day 2 of the convention, we have decided to DOUBLE MATCH all donations for the next 3 hours. If we hit 200 donors, the match will be extended. Will you help us hit our goal and keep the match going?

Friend,
Nancy Pelosi’s impeachment effort has been wrong for our country from day one. It was a rushed process. It was an incomplete process. It was a process that identified a punishment, then searched for a crime… It was a complete circus, and Nancy was the ringleader.
The Democrats have been at this charade for years. First it was Russian collusion, then obstruction of justice, then campaign finance law abuses and then violations of the “Emoluments Clause.” In each case, these outrageous accusations turned out to be untrue. Yet Democrats only looked harder for another excuse.
Now, we find ourselves heading into an official trial which could result in President Trump’s expulsion from office. Having tried every other trick in the book, the Democrats have now pushed our Constitution to the limit.
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… As someone who served as a district judge, state Supreme Court justice and Texas Attorney General and now sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, I want to know…
* What happened to the presumption of innocence in all this?
* While Democrats say no one is above the law, why can’t they point to the law they think the President violated?
* What happened to fundamental fairness? The House sat behind closed doors and concentrated all control in the hands of six Democratic committee chairmen. Where is the fairness?
As your Senator, I will be called upon to respond after House Democrats have rushed to impeach the President. That day has arrived.
Chuck Schumer and Liberal interest groups are already stepping up efforts to pressure me. They want to use impeachment as a tool to beat me and turn Texas blue.
But friend, I won’t budge.
I will start with the presumption of the President’s innocence. I will neither be sucked in nor fan the flames of wild rumors and political accusations.
The next few days represent a critical moment for America, and I need to know that you’re with me as I stand firm as the firewall between outrageous partisanship and the Constitution of the United States.
I’m asking you to join me by chipping in $25 to DEFEND our constitution.

Friend,
We’ve been saying this for a while but liberals from across the country want nothing more than to flip Texas blue. They know that if they win Texas, they will control all facets of government.
With a massive investment this year, they are banking on outside money putting them over the top.
They’re calling in all the Far-Left liberals from around the country to help: Chuck Schumer. Nancy Pelosi. Kamala Harris. Elizabeth Warren.
These coastal elites have no business here in Texas.
Friend, we simply can’t allow these radicals to buy our state.
KEEP TEXAS RED
Schumer knows that if he gets his way, he will have another rubber stamp for his radical agenda.
The top items on Schumer and the Far-Left’s list:
* Higher Taxes.
* Socialized Medicine.
* Open Borders.
* Defunding the Police.
Don’t let Schumer get another puppet in the Senate.
Team Cornyn
\--------Forwarded Message Below------

Friend, our opponent has been enlisting outside help to try and change Texas for good.
The latest Far-Left radical to try and meddle in Texas…. KAMALA HARRIS!
Take a look at what Kamala had to say about Texas:
KEEP TEXAS RED
Friend, she’s right. The impact would be catastrophic not only for Texas but the entire country.
WE CAN’T LET THIS HAPPEN.
Our opponent would rather pander to Far-Left radicals from across the country than defending the values of Texans right here in our state. Her campaign is being bankrolled by Coastal Elites and DC special interest groups. The question is: With all this outside help, what are they expecting in return?
Has she promised to turn Texas into the new California?
Higher Taxes.
Massive crime.
Uncontrollable cities.
We must keep Texas representative of and for Texans, NOT elites from California and New York.
Are you ready to take a stand and defend Texas?
KEEP TEXAS RED
Polls have shown a close race in Texas. Schumer and the DSCC have made a historic investment into flipping Texas this year.
It is vital we have the resources to answer back.

Friend,
This just happened – you may not have heard yet. I needed to bring you up to speed immediately… read carefully:
Today, Nancy Pelosi made a surprise, early-morning announcement about the impeachment of President Trump: She has asked the House to proceed with official articles of impeachment.
The Democrats have officially taken their politically-motivated impeachment process to the next level.
They have decided to abuse our Constitution… to use powers reserved for the highest crimes to remove a president that Democrats personally dislike.
During her announcement, Pelosi said that “the facts are uncontested...” despite the fact that these sham hearings have failed to produce a single verifiable fact.
It’s shameful, and tugs at the fabric of our democracy.
This is serious, friend, which is why I am asking you to take IMMEDIATE action to defend President Trump… Today, the impeachment of our president is officially closer than ever, and he needs to know we’re in his corner.

Friend,
Imagine your town, but with Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer in charge…
The Liberal Mob runs rampant through your streets.
Your local police force is defunded and reduced to nothing.
Leaving no one to defend you from the crime spewing out of our wide open borders.
You can’t see your doctor anymore because of Medicare for All.
And your friends with well-paying energy jobs? They’re now unemployed thanks to the Green New Deal.
This is the future the Radical Left wants for us. They want to bring it to Texas, and they want to bring it quickly.
But friend, one man stands in the way of these dangerous leftists: John Cornyn. He’s fighting to keep Texas red. To defend the Senate majority. To keep our president in the White House.
But he needs your help, friend. In just a few days, he’ll hit an all-important deadline… the August End of Month deadline. He needs YOU to do anything you can to boost his fight. Will you chip in immediately?

Senator Cornyn will be a central figure in this trial, and he WILL fight against the Left’s radical tactics… he will fight FOR President Trump.
Friend, we need your help to defend our innocent president. Are you with us? Will you chip in $25 now to show support of our 45th president?
CHIP IN $25 NOW
This whole impeachment process has been a sham. The Left has found no evidence against President Trump. Not a single Republican voted with the Democrats. This has been a partisan SHAM.
The clock is ticking. We are running out of time. We need you to reaffirm your commitment to our president. I need you to show me you are still committed to this fight. If you don’t show us, we will just take it as you wanting our president impeached AND removed.
I look forward to seeing your name on our donor’s list.
Thanks, friend.

Friend,
Senator Cornyn asked me to pull a fresh list of folks who took action to defend President Trump from impeachment.
Remember, now that Pelosi decided to stop her power grab, and articles of impeachment have been delivered to the Senate, President Trump is standing trial.
This is a critical moment in the history of our nation.
Senator Cornyn wants to see exactly who is standing with him. Will you make sure your name is on the list?

Friend,
Nancy Pelosi’s impeachment effort has been wrong for our country from day one. It was a rushed process. It was an incomplete process. It was a process that identified a punishment, then searched for a crime… It was a complete circus, and Nancy was the ringleader.
The Democrats have been at this charade for years. First it was Russian collusion, then obstruction of justice, then campaign finance law abuses and then violations of the “Emoluments Clause.” In each case, these outrageous accusations turned out to be untrue. Yet Democrats only looked harder for another excuse.
Now, we find ourselves heading into an official trial which could result in President Trump’s expulsion from office. Having tried every other trick in the book, the Democrats have now pushed our Constitution to the limit.
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… As someone who served as a district judge, state Supreme Court justice and Texas Attorney General and now sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, I want to know…
* What happened to the presumption of innocence in all this?
* While Democrats say no one is above the law, why can’t they point to the law they think the President violated?
* What happened to fundamental fairness? The House sat behind closed doors and concentrated all control in the hands of six Democratic committee chairmen. Where is the fairness?
As your Senator, I will be called upon to respond after House Democrats have rushed to impeach the President. That day has arrived.
Chuck Schumer and Liberal interest groups are already stepping up efforts to pressure me. They want to use impeachment as a tool to beat me and turn Texas blue.
But friend, I won’t budge.
I will start with the presumption of the President’s innocence. I will neither be sucked in nor fan the flames of wild rumors and political accusations.
The next few days represent a critical moment for America, and I need to know that you’re with me as I stand firm as the firewall between outrageous partisanship and the Constitution of the United States.
I’m asking you to join me by chipping in $25 to DEFEND our constitution.
In times like these, with so much on the line, we CAN’T afford to sit by idly...

Friend,
It’s official. Donald J. Trump is now the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. The Democrats have taken their charade to the nth degree, using our Constitution as a partisan weapon.
This process began the day he was duly elected president, and culminated yesterday in a one-sided vote void of any fact or truly impeachable offense.
Yesterday was a sad day in American history. Democrats should be ashamed of their actions.
But friend, the longer we sit in silence, the more credibility we give Pelosi, Schiff, and Nadler.
We need to ban together and make a loud statement in defiance of the Left’s disgusting abuse of our Constitution, and we need to make it quickly.

Friend, Democrats have had their minds made up from the outset. In their minds, President Trump was guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors before he even took office.
In the Senate, I assure you our president will be treated differently. We’ll give him a fair shake and wrap up this sham impeachment with an acquittal.
But before we do that, I’m counting on you to embrace this chance to make a statement that will go down in history…

Chaos and crime has filled the streets of Portland, Seattle, Atlanta, and Chicago... to name just a few. The Left's response: “these are peaceful protests.”
Friend, there is nothing peaceful about vandalizing small businesses, there is nothing peaceful about intimidating homeowners, there is nothing peaceful about stealing.
We need to stand up. We need to be UNITED. We need your help.
Last week Democrats raised a lot of money. We need to answer back.
For a limited time, to celebrate Day 2 of the convention, we have decided to DOUBLE MATCH all donations for the next 3 hours. If we hit 200 donors, the match will be extended. Will you help us hit our goal and keep the match going?

I will FIGHT to make sure that their radical argument for removal goes NOWHERE. I will fight our president’s exoneration…
I need to know that you’re with me. That you’re with the president…
Why haven’t you answered the call?
If I don’t hear from you, friend, I’ll have to assume you’ve fallen into the Left’s clutches. I need to know that you’re with me in my fight for President Trump! Will you chip in $25 now?

Friend,
Nancy Pelosi’s impeachment effort has been wrong for our country from day one. It was a rushed process. It was an incomplete process. It was a process that identified a punishment, then searched for a crime… It was a complete circus, and Nancy was the ringleader.
The Democrats have been at this charade for years. First it was Russian collusion, then obstruction of justice, then campaign finance law abuses and then violations of the “Emoluments Clause.” In each case, these outrageous accusations turned out to be untrue. Yet Democrats only looked harder for another excuse.
Now, we find ourselves heading into an official trial which could result in President Trump’s expulsion from office. Having tried every other trick in the book, the Democrats have now pushed our Constitution to the limit.
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… As someone who served as a district judge, state Supreme Court justice and Texas Attorney General and now sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, I want to know…
* What happened to the presumption of innocence in all this?
* While Democrats say no one is above the law, why can’t they point to the law they think the President violated?
* What happened to fundamental fairness? The House sat behind closed doors and concentrated all control in the hands of six Democratic committee chairmen. Where is the fairness?
As your Senator, I will be called upon to respond after House Democrats have rushed to impeach the President. That day has arrived.
Chuck Schumer and Liberal interest groups are already stepping up efforts to pressure me. They want to use impeachment as a tool to beat me and turn Texas blue.
But friend, I won’t budge.
I will start with the presumption of the President’s innocence. I will neither be sucked in nor fan the flames of wild rumors and political accusations.
The next few days represent a critical moment for America, and I need to know that you’re with me as I stand firm as the firewall between outrageous partisanship and the Constitution of the United States.
I’m asking you to join me by chipping in $25 to DEFEND our constitution.
In times like these, with so much on the line, we CAN’T afford to sit by idly...

John Cornyn calls impeachment case ‘half-baked,’ says it has bolstered Trump’s reelection prospects—and his own
Texan accuses Democrats of power grab and insists it has backfired
By Todd J. Gillman and Tom Benning
Published in the Dallas Morning News
February 5, 2020
Facebook Twitter
WASHINGTON — Hours before the Senate would vote on two articles of impeachment, Texas Sen. John Cornyn accused Democrats of trampling on the Constitution in service of a “crusade” to oust President Donald Trump.
In a floor speech Wednesday, he characterized the allegations as well short of the standards required to remove a president, particularly without bipartisan support and as Trump seeks reelection.
Unlike a handful of GOP colleagues, Cornyn expressed no dismay over the actions at the heart of the impeachment: a pressure campaign aimed at prodding Ukraine to announce a corruption probe targeting a political rival, Joe Biden, using U.S. military aid as leverage.
“Certainly the House managers did not meet the high burden required to remove the president from office, effectively nullifying the will of tens of millions of Americans, just month before the next election,” Cornyn said, who previously has called the effort “insane.”
“I hope our Democratic colleagues will finally accept the results of this trial, just as they have not accepted the results of the 2016 election,” he said.
The outcome of the trial is not in doubt. A two-thirds majority of senators is required to convict. Republicans control 53 of 100 seats and none have signaled an intention to vote for conviction. Still, a few have chastised Trump for his behavior. Others, among them Texas’ junior senator, Ted Cruz, have rallied behind Trump, conceding no hint of wrongdoing and vehemently accusing Democrats of pursuing a case that is factually baseless and constitutionally inadequate.
“Impeachment is an extraordinary remedy,” Cruz said during his 10-minute slot on Tuesday ahead of the vote. ""It’s not designed for when you have political differences or policy differences. It’s designed for when the president crosses the constitutional threshold.”
Cornyn is seeking a fourth six-year term in the fall, and Democrats hoping to unseat him have aggressively sought to turn his stance on impeachment to their advantage.
“Senator Cornyn has proven that he is uninterested in evidence and testimony and instead will continue to put political loyalty ahead of doing his job,” one of those Democratic contenders, M.J. Hegar, said earlier in the trial.
When Senate Republicans shot down demands from Democrats to call witnesses at the trial, Texas Democratic Party chair Gilberto Hinojosa said they “shamelessly... chose to support McConnell’s cover-up over upholding their constitutional oath.”
Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie noted that during the Senate trial, lawyers played snippets of testimony from 13 witnesses at the House impeachment hearings, and the trial record included 28,000 pages of documents. Democrats sought testimony from witnesses Trump ordered not to cooperate with the House, and to subpoena documents the administration refused to turn over to the House.
But even as Democrats insist that acquittal will give Trump and future presidents license to abuse their power, Cornyn argued that conviction in a “politically motivated impeachment sets a dangerous precedent.... If successful, this would give a green light to future congresses to weaponize impeachment to defeat a political opponent, for any action, even a failure to kowtow to Congress’s wishes.”
He previewed his floor remarks on conservative talk radio, telling host Hugh Hewitt earlier Wednesday that the case presented at trial “was simply half-baked. [[URL REDACTED]] the private sector, if lawyers had presented a case the way the impeachment managers did, they’d be sued for legal malpractice. It was just a disaster from the start, and so the president will be justly acquitted.”
On the Senate floor, Cornyn asserted that “they’ve failed to bring forward any unassailable evidence” of a high crime or misdemeanor of the sort required for impeachment.
Like nearly all GOP senators, Cornyn voted against calling any witnesses or demanding any documents from the White House, State Department or Pentagon that prosecutors sought, including testimony from Trump’s chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and former national security advisor, John Bolton.
Trump blocked testimony from those and other key players and issued a blanket refusal to turn over administration documents.
Democrats accused him of stonewalling. And they accused his allies in the Senate of enabling a cover-up, willfully blinding themselves to evidence that would have been even more persuasive than what the House did manage to collect despite the obstacles.
But impeachment, Cornyn said, should be used only “when absolutely necessary…. We should be extraordinarily vigilant to make sure that the impeachment power does not become a regular feature of our differences, and in the process, cheapen the vote of the American people.”
He ascribed partisan motives to Democrats, accusing them not only of trying to remove Trump — whose successor would be his hand-picked vice president, Mike Pence — but of flipping control of the Senate so that Democrat Chuck Schumer would replace Republican Mitch McConnell as majority leader.
Trump is the third president to be formally impeached. Richard Nixon resigned to avert impeachment over Watergate. No president has been removed from office.
“I’ve done my best to listen intently to both sides… and I’m confident in saying that President Trump should be acquitted, and not removed from office,” Cornyn said.
As for the implications on his reelection prospects, Cornyn told The Dallas Morning News off the Senate floor that “This isn’t just about this president. This is about the presidency itself and whether we trust the American people to choose their own leaders.
“If my Democratic friends who are running for the Senate have different views, I’d love to engage with them on the campaign trail on that. I think the Texas voters would be with me and not with this idea to remove a president from the ballot just months before the next presidential election.”
In fact, he said, the assault on Trump’s presidency has backfired.
“Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats are doing everything they can to see that he’s reelected,” he asserted.

Friend,
It’s official. Donald J. Trump is now the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. The Democrats have taken their charade to the nth degree, using our Constitution as a partisan weapon.
This process began the day he was duly elected president, and culminates today in a one-sided vote void of any fact or truly impeachable offense.
Today is a sad day in American history. Democrats should be ashamed of their actions.
But friend, the longer we sit in silence, the more credibility we give Pelosi, Schiff, and Nadler.
We need to ban together and make a loud statement in defiance of the Left’s disgusting abuse of our Constitution, and we need to make it quickly.

Image
Radical Left-Coaster Kamala Harris is barnstorming Texas today in a last ditch effort to do damage control after Joe Biden’s “transition from the oil industry” threat. While we don’t expect Harris’ apology tour to win over many voters, one Texan is all in with her radical agenda: MJ Hegar.
“Kamala Harris is the most liberal senator in DC. She co-sponsored Bernie Sanders’ Medicare-for-All plan and wants to tear apart ICE, and seems to have found a radical equal in MJ Hegar,” said Krista Piferrer, press secretary. “While their big government goals might resonate on Kamala’s Left-Coast turf, Texans aren’t interested in becoming California.”
Below is a dire warning of what Texas would look like with a Harris-Hegar Duo...
On energy, the two would impose cap and trade and a carbon tax, pursue the “intent” of the Green New Deal, and ban fracking as rapidly as possible -- killing hundreds of thousands of jobs, increasing electricity and gas prices on households throughout the state, and undercutting America’s energy independence.
Employer health coverage? Gone. As MJ said, “single payer is the future” -- music to the ears of Medicare for All’s co-sponsor, Harris.
Both candidates are comfortable standing by while cities defund and “reimagine” the police. And a Harris-Hegar duo would raise taxes significantly by rolling back the 2017 tax cuts and raising the payroll tax -- creating even greater financial hardship for families and our economy as we work to dig out of a recession.
ENERGY
ANTI-OIL ATTACKS
Hegar And Harris Agree: They Both Attack The Oil Industry
Speaking To Reporters This Week, Hegar Refused To Criticize Or Condemn Vice President Biden’s Comments That Pledged To Transition Away From The Oil Industry. QUESTION: “MJ, Lizzie Fletcher said those Biden comments failed to address the complexity of the situation in Texas. Do you agree with that – even if you agree with the sentiment he was expressing, he was maybe a little too flippant with those comments?” HEGAR: “I gotta be honest with you, I’m not really paying attention that closely to the national stage. I’m talking to energy workers, I’m paying attention to my –” QUESTION: “Well, Lizzie Fletcher represents Houston.” HEGAR: “Year, I understand that. But, you know, maybe she was, I don’t know. I can’t speak for Lizzie and I can’t speak for Biden. I can just pseak for me and my, you know, business acumen. My executive MBA tells me we need to lean in to disruptive innovative technology when an industry is dominating and then technology comes along that transitions that energy into the next chapter. You’ve got to get onboard or you’re gonna get left behind.” (Patrick Svitek, Twitter, 10/27/20)
* Hegar Previously Criticized Texas’ History Of “Leading In All The Wrong Places,” Naming The Oil Industry And Likening It To “Gun Violence” And “Lack Of Health Care.” HEGAR: “I don't know about y’all—and I keep saying this—I feel like the whole world is watching what's happening in Texas right now. And they're paying attention, and we are the biggest battleground state in the country. And, you know, they look at us and for so long they've seen a low voter turnout state, they've seen we're leading in all the wrong places, in lack of health care, and gun violence, and the oil industry. And now they see people, they see the results of what we've been working so hard for and the momentum and the excitement across the state.” (MJ Hegar, Remarks At Virtual Northeast Tarrant County Democrats Brunch, 8/29/20; 16:13-16:47)
As A Presidential Candidate, Harris Pledged To “Convene A Meeting Of Major Emitters” To Engage In The “First-Ever Global Negotiation Of The Cooperative Managed Decline Of Fossil Fuel Production.” “As a follow up to the G7 meeting being hosted by the Trump Administration in 2020, and the G20 meeting to be hosted by Saudi Arabia in that same year, Kamala will propose and convene a meeting of major emitters in early 2021, focusing on climate change and the global economy. The meeting will focus on renewed commitments to fossil-fuel subsidy phase out and the first-ever global negotiation of the cooperative managed decline of fossil fuel production.” (“A Climate Plan For The People,” Kamala Harris For The People, Archived 4/17/20)
The Biden-Harris Ticket Has Promised To “Transition From The Oil Industry.” WELKER: “OK, I have one final question—"" TRUMP: “Would you close down the-- Would you close down the oil industry?” BIDEN: “I would transition from the oil industry. Yes.” TRUMP: “Oh, transition.” BIDEN: “It is a big statement because I would stop—"" WELKER: “Why would you do that?” BIDEN: “Because the oil industry significantly — but here's the deal —"" TRUMP: “That’s a big statement.” BIDEN: “Well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time. Over time. And I’d stop giving to the oil industry-- I’d stop giving them federal subsidies. You won't give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind. Why are we giving it to the oil industry?” (Vice President Joe Biden, Remarks At Presidential Debate, 10/22/20; 1:53:04-1:54:05)
CARBON TAX
Hegar And Harris Agree: They Both Want A Job-Destroying Carbon Tax
Hegar In August 2020: “I Stand With The League Of Conservation Voters And The Sierra Club, Who Support A Carbon Tax…” “If Biden wins, and if you’re in the Senate, it’s pretty likely that there’s going to be climate legislation. I think it’s widely agreed among economists and others that meaningful climate legislation will mean, in some form or another, a carbon tax. Will you support that? You know, I stand with the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, who support a carbon tax but also understand that it needs to be done in a way that doesn’t just pass the burden on to the middle class and to economically disadvantaged areas that are going to have to pay more for gasoline and for milk and for transportation and things like that.” (Jeff Goodell, “Is Texas Ready For A Democratic Senator? MJ Hegar Thinks So,” Rolling Stone, 8/14/20)
Sen. Kamala Harris Has Supported A Carbon Tax. “Other candidates who say they would support a carbon tax include Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren; former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former housing secretary Julian Castro; and California Sen. Kamala Harris.” (Emma Newburger, “‘Hit Them Where It Hurts’: Several 2020 Democrats Want A Carbon Tax On Corporations,” CNBC, 9/20/19)
* Harris’s Climate Plan: “A Climate Pollution Fee Can Play An Important Role As One Of Several Interrelated Policies To Reduce Emissions And Hold Polluters Accountable.” “Harris is no longer running for president. ‘A climate pollution fee can play an important role as one of several interrelated policies to reduce emissions and hold polluters accountable,’ Harris's climate plan said. ‘As Governor Inslee noted, a price on pollution is not a silver bullet, but by placing a progressively increasing fee as far upstream as possible, we can drive down pollution while raising government revenues that can be used to address the harms of greenhouse gas emissions. However, history shows us that reliance on market mechanisms alone can often leave communities behind. That’s why [Harris] will involve frontline communities in the fee development process, and would ensure that the fee revenues are invested back into those communities to improve environmental conditions and local economic development.’” (The Washington Post Website, Accessed 10/27/20)
CAP & TRADE
Hegar And Harris Agree: They Both Have Defended A Cap And Trade System
On A February 2020 Questionnaire, Hegar Said She Supported A Cap And Trade System For Carbon. QUESTION: “Would you support a cap-and-trade plan in an effort to reduce carbon emissions?” ANSWER: “Yes. Climate change is the greatest threat to the health and safety of our communities, the world we are leaving for the next generation and our national security. We must set aggressive goals for the expansion of clean, renewable energy, and invest in clean energy manufacturing and sustainable transportation. Texas has the opportunity to be America’s leader in wind and solar energy, and we should use our natural, renewable resources to create jobs in our state.” (Matthew Watkins, Darla Cameron And Anna Novak, “How Are The Top Democratic U.S. Senate Candidates In Texas Different? We Asked Them 11 Questions To Find Out.,” Texas Tribune, 2/12/20)
As California AG, Harris Defended The State’s Cap-And-Trade Program And The EPA’s Clean Power Plan. “Kamala Harris has dedicated her career to public service and fighting for justice. As California attorney general, Harris has defended key environmental laws, including California’s cap and trade program and the EPA’s Clean Power Plan. During her tenure, California led the nation in developing innovative measures to fight climate change. Harris was elected attorney general in 2010 and previously served as district attorney of San Francisco. Harris will work to bring California’s ambitious environmental leadership to the U.S. Senate. She will make it a priority to pass comprehensive legislation to address climate change and continue to grow California’s clean energy economy. Harris will also work to develop solutions to mitigate the effects of the drought in California and protect California’s majestic public lands and natural treasures.” (League Of Conservation Voters Website, Accessed 10/27/20)
GREEN NEW DEAL
The Hegar-Harris Position On The Green New Deal: It’s Complicated
In 2020, Hegar Has Said She Supports “The Intent” Of The Green New Deal, Noting The Need For “A Course Of Action On Climate Change.” “Hegar said she is not on board with the Green New Deal and never mentioned it during a recent 45-minute online environmental town hall with supporters. ‘I support the intent. I think we need a course of action on climate change; I don't support the Green New Deal specifically,’ she said. ‘It politicizes the most important issue facing our kids, which is climate changes, and I would like to sever the politics away from it as much as possible and build a broad bipartisan coalition.’ Hegar, who prefers talking about clean energy investments rather than climate regulations, concedes she is not an expert on environmental issues and said she would work on proposals with groups like LCV and the Sierra Club.” (George Cahlink, “Texas Senate Fight Offers Dueling Visions Of Energy's Future,” E&E News, 9/30/20)
“Ms. Harris Was An Original Co-Sponsor Of The Green New Deal, A Plan To Curb Planet-Warming Greenhouse Gas Emissions While Also Addressing Economic Inequality.” “But in other ways she has been leading. Ms. Harris was an original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, a plan to curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions while also addressing economic inequality. She has called for abolishing the filibuster if Republicans stand in the way of passing climate change legislation. She also favors a ban on fracking, a position that could put her at odds with Mr. Biden, who has called for a ban on new leases on federal lands but stopped short of calling for a comprehensive ban. President Trump’s campaign on Tuesday criticized Ms. Harris’ position on fracking as well as her support for the Green New Deal, saying both positions will lead to ‘economic catastrophe in natural gas states like Pennsylvania.’” (Lisa Friedman, “With The Biden-Harris Ticket, Environmental Justice Is A Focus,” The New York Times, 8/12/20)
HEALTH CARE
MEDICARE FOR ALL
Hegar And Harris Agree: Single-Payer Would Be “Great”
Hegar In 2018: “I Think A ‘Medicare For All’ Model Could Be Great…” EVAN SMITH: “This year ‘Medicare for All’ is a bit of a bauble on the charm bracelet for Democratic candidates. It is a test of your progressiveness as a candidate running for office. Are you for ‘Medicare for All’ or not?” HEGAR: “So, I have been the recipient of multiple single-player models.” SMITH: “You know government health care, right?” HEGAR: “I certainly do.” SMITH: “You have been the recipient of government health care.” HEGAR: “I have been the recipient of one called TRICARE, which is actually very similar to Medicare, and my mom is on Medicare now and I think it’s a great program. I think a ‘Medicare for All’ model could be great, but I’m also pragmatic and I’m fiscally responsible. I want to know how we’re going to pay for it. I also do think, we’re actually already paying for it, just not with taxes but with high health care costs and with people who are getting primary care in emergency rooms.” (MJ Hegar, Remarks At Texas Tribune CD-31 Conversation, 9/13/18; 49:20)
* Hegar: “I Think That Single-Payer Is The Future Of Our Health Care System…” MODERATOR: “Would you support a single payer health system in the United States. Yes or no? This is from someone named Joseph.” HEGAR: “The answer is yes. I think that single-payer is the future of our health care system, like it is in most industrialized countries. However, I think we need to focus on the right single-payer model. I myself have been the recipient of two single-payer models: One that worked really well and one that did not work. So I am committed to – I think we need to hold our candidates to a higher standard than just asking yes-or-no.” (MJ Hegar, Remarks To Texas Tribune, 3/21/18, 8:26–10:00)
Sen. Kamala Harris Was A Cosponsor On Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare For All Plan And Offered Her Own Version Of A Medicare For All Plan While Running For President. “California Sen. Kamala Harris has released a health care plan just in time for the second Democratic debate, offering a role for private insurance in a ‘Medicare for All’ system and outlining new taxes to pay for it. The plan comes after months of questions about whether she supports scrapping private insurance — and as former Vice President Joe Biden appears to be gearing up to attack her at the upcoming debate on her support for Medicare for All. To review, Bernie Sanders' single-payer health plan is called ‘Medicare for All,’ and Kamala Harris is a co-sponsor on that plan (along with several other presidential candidates, including New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren). His plan would cover all Americans with a government-administered health care plan.” (Danielle Kurtzleben, “Kamala Harris Releases 'Medicare For All' Plan With A Role For Private Insurers,” NPR, 7/29/19)
* Harris Raised Her Hand At A 2019 Debate In Favor Of Eliminating Private Insurance And Said At A CNN Town Hall She Would Support Eliminating All Private Health Insurance. “On the debate stage Thursday, Senator Kamala Harris raised her hand, seemingly in support of a government insurance proposal that would eliminate employer insurance. On Friday, she said she had misunderstood the question. The wording of the question left room for confusion, but Ms. Harris also has a history of making conflicting statements on the issue. In a CNN town hall in January, she said she’d favor eliminating all private health insurance. The next day, her campaign walked it back. A single-payer health plan requires people with other forms of comprehensive health insurance to switch. That is a politically risky position. Some Democrats have hedged by backing more gradual, optional expansions of public coverage. Others have decided that they can persuade voters that the advantages outweigh the disruption. Ms. Harris, so far, hasn’t chosen either one.” (Margot Sanger-Katz, “Where Is Kamala Harris On Medicare For All Vs. Private Insurance?,” The New York Times, 6/28/19)
POLICE
FUNDING
Hegar And Harris Agree: Funding Should Be Examined To Secure Police Reforms
When Asked About The Movement To Defund Police Departments, Hegar Said She Would Consider Using Funding As A Means Of Securing Policing Reforms. HOST: “Sen. Bernie Sanders last week tweeted that every police department that violates the civil rights of an individual should be stripped of federal funding. If you’re in the Senate, you may have to consider such legislation. Do you agree with Sen. Sanders?” … HEGAR: “Funding is definitely one of the tools we should be considering using. However, as someone who has been granted the authority to use deadly force when I was in the military as a combat-search-and-rescue helicopter pilot, as you know Gromer, when we were shot down and surrounded by 150 enemy fighters, we got everybody out alive and I was very cognizant of the fact that we had the authority to use deadly force. So I sympathize. But at the same time, the standards are so high for when we can pull the trigger in the military. I would like to see a similar standard in our police force. And I am dedicated to supporting the leaders within the law enforcement community who want to see that same transparency and accountability.” (MJ Hegar, Remarks At Democratic Senate Runoff Debate, 6/6/20; 10:30-12:05)
Hegar Has Said She Supports Police Reform “Proposals That Are Outlined In Places Like Campaign Zero.” “The conversation about climate is also a conversation about racial justice, environmental justice. And that leads into the other big thing that happened since you declared your candidacy, which is the Black Lives Matter movement and the killing of George Floyd, who was from Houston. How has this changed your candidacy and your politics? I’ve been talking about the need for reforms in policing [and] criminal-justice reform for years, like so many people have. And I think what’s different now is that our calls for reform will finally not fall on deaf ears. I think that this election is really our opportunity to be heard loud and clear. Every day, I am profoundly and deeply aware that I’m asking to represent folks across Texas who have been let down and sold out by a system, and by the people, by the way, who have been holding up that system, that refuses to enact the reforms that will make a difference in our communities. I support proposals that are outlined in places like Campaign Zero, that include ending for-profit policing practices and ensuring that police departments are a part of and representative of their communities. But I also think that we need to support leaders in the criminal justice system and in the police who want transparency and reform.” (Jeff Goodell, “Is Texas Ready For A Democratic Senator? MJ Hegar Thinks So,” Rolling Stone, 8/14/20)
* Campaign Zero Has Called For De-Prioritizing Of “Minor” Offenses, Including Disorderly Conduct, Trespassing, And Prostitution. “End Policing of Minor ‘Broken Windows’ Offenses The following activities do not threaten public safety and are often used to police black communities. Decriminalize these activities or de-prioritize their enforcement: Consumption of Alcohol on Streets Marijuana Possession Disorderly Conduct Trespassing Loitering Disturbing the Peace (including Loud Music) Spitting Jaywalking Bicycling on the Sidewalk Prostitution” (Campaign Zero Website, Accessed 7/21/20)
* Campaign Zero’s “8 Can’t Wait” Website Has Listed Among Its Goals: “Divest From Police” And “Fully Defund Police.” (8 Can’t Wait Website, Archived 7/21/20)
During An Appearance On “The View,” Sen. Kamala Harris Spoke Of “Reimagining How We Do Public Safety In America.” “During this summer of tear gas and turmoil, Kamala Harris has not been quiet. On ‘The View,’ the California senator spoke about ‘reimagining how we do public safety in America.’ On the Senate floor, she sparred with Rand Paul after the Kentucky Republican blocked a bill to make lynching a federal crime, and she is among the Democrats sponsoring policing legislation that would ban choke holds, racial profiling and no-knock warrants.” (Danny Hakim, Stephanie Saul and Richard A. Oppel Jr., “‘Top Cop’ Kamala Harris’s Record Of Policing The Police,” The New York Times, 8/9/20)
* In A “Good Morning America” Interview On Policing Reforms, Harris Said We Have To “Re-Examine What We're Doing With American Taxpayer Dollars And Ask The Question: Are We Getting The Right Return On Our Investment?” “Though Mayor Eric Garcetti has received significant backlash over his proposal to redirect funds earmarked for Los Angeles' police force, California Sen. Kamala Harris is speaking out in favor of the idea. Garcetti's proposal would invest some $250 million into health care, jobs and ‘healing’ aimed largely at the black community. The union representing LAPD officers fired back at the mayor, labeling him ‘unstable’ and accusing him of political pandering after he referred to ‘killers’ in remarks about the proposed spending change. In an interview on ‘Good Morning America,’ Harris voiced her support for investing in communities, noting that many American cities spend over one-third of their entire budget on policing, while defunding public schools. ‘We've got to re-examine what we're doing with American taxpayer dollars and ask the question: are we getting the right return on our investment? Are we actually creating healthy and safe communities?,’ she said. ‘That's a legitimate conversation and it requires a really critical evaluation. I applaud Eric Garcetti for doing what he's done.’” (“Sen. Kamala Harris Voices Support Of LA Mayor Garcetti's Call For Police Reform, Budget Cuts,” ABC 7, 6/9/20)
TAXES
INCOME TAXES
Hegar And Harris Agree: “Walk Back The Tax Reform” And Raise Taxes On Individuals And Job Creators
Hegar In 2020: “We’ve Got To Walk Back The Tax Reform – The Tax Scam.” HEGAR: “You know, we’ve got to walk back the tax reform – the tax scam. It was not a middle-class miracle. I am fighting for the middle class. I believe we’re leaving the lower middle class completely out. We have programs that help people in poverty. The upper middle class is doing okay. We’re leaving out this group of people.” (MJ Hegar, Remarks At A Campaign Event, San Antonio, TX, 2/19/20; 15:40-16:05)
As A Presidential Candidate, Harris Pledged To “Reverse” The GOP Tax Reform And Raise Taxes On Individuals And Job Creators. “But a much higher-profile priority for Harris is the reversal of the GOP-backed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act decreases in tax rates for businesses and rich Americans. ‘Much like Biden, she’s an advocate of higher taxes on businesses and higher-income, wealthy households,’ Zandi said. The platform laid out on Harris’s website promised to ‘reverse President Donald Trump’s trillion-dollar tax cut for big corporations and the top 1 percent.’ Those funds would go toward one of her signature policy initiatives: a refundable tax credit that would effectively function as a big expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit.” (Martha C. White, “Kamala Harris’ Economic Policy: Roll Back Tax Cuts, Expand Health Care And Middle-Class Tax Breaks,” NBC News, 8/13/20)
SOCIAL SECURITY
Hegar And Harris Agree: Hike Payroll Taxes
Hegar Has Vowed To “Raise The Income Cap” On The Social Security Payroll Tax. PADILLA: “MJ, MJ, if you get to be the Senator, look about making sure that we raise the cap, spread the cap on Social Security. Some of those that are making enough money can pay the—” HEGAR: “The income cap. I agree with you completely, Tony. Thank you for bringing that up. We should have talked about that. Raise the income cap.” (MJ Hegar, Remarks At Social Security & Medicare Virtual Town Hall, 10/6/20; 37:25-37:45)
In 2019, Harris Co-Sponsored Bernie Sanders’ Bill To Remove Social Security’s Taxable Income Cap For Taxpayers Making More Than $250,000. “Today, U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) joined her colleagues to introduce legislation to expand Social Security benefits and strengthen the retirement program for generations to come. The legislation would increase benefits by about $1,342 a year for seniors now making less than $16,000 annually and increase cost-of-living adjustments by more accurately measuring the spending patterns of seniors… The bill would ensure that Social Security could pay every benefit owed to every eligible American for the next 52 years, according to the retirement system’s chief actuary. It would extend the program’s solvency by making the wealthiest 1.8 percent of Americans – those with incomes of more than $250,000 a year – pay the same rate into the retirement system as everyone else already pays. Current law caps the amount of income subject to payroll taxes at $132,900. In addition to Senator Harris, the bill is cosponsored by Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR).” (Sen. Kamala Harris, “Harris Joins Colleagues to Introduce Bill to Expand Social Security,” Press Release, 2/13/19)

Alex, we should always be working to make sure police are accountable to the people and doing their job fairly and safely. Unfortunately, Democrats like AOC and Shady Shalala have either actively encouraged or stayed silent as that message has been hijacked by radical socialists.
They stay silent as:
❌ Police officers are assaulted and attacked by radical socialists.
❌ Police officers are defunded during a rising violent crime wave.
❌ Police officers are targeted by arsonists and violent radicals.
Socialists around the country are hijacking a movement meant to make American society better. Their attempts to dismantle our police and destroy our cities must be stopped. If you agree, sign the petition now and Defend Our Police!

Meet Dr. Cameron Webb, one of our NewDem Frontier candidates who is running to flip Virginia’s 5th district blue in November.
Service and hard work are in Cameron’s blood - his mother worked in a public school and his father worked as a law enforcement official in the Drug Enforcement Administration. Cameron took these values to heart, first as a fellow in the Obama Administration, and now as a practicing physician.
That’s a record of service to be proud of. And his right-wing Republican opponent Bob Good knows it.
Dr. Webb will be the first Black doctor elected to Congress. And Bob Good knows that Cameron has momentum in this race. That's why he started a smear campaign. He’s out with an ad that tells voters to “look past [his] smooth presentation” and tries to connect him with rioting and crime.
I’ll be blunt - this ad is racist and it has no place in our politics. That's why I'm asking our supporters to kick in for Dr. Webb today and help him fight back.
But these racist lies won’t scare Cameron. He’s firing back with an ad that sets the record straight and highlights his support from the law enforcement community. Now he needs to make sure he has the resources to keep it on the air. Will you chip in to help Cameron spread his message and stop the Republican lies?
Fear-mongering has no place in politics. Will you chip in to show that you stand with Cameron against this hateful smear campaign?
Cameron can win this and make history as the first Black doctor elected to Congress. He’s ready to get to work. Chip in now to ensure he has the resources to set the record straight and make sure this race is fair and honest.
Be well,

Republicans are desperate to take down Dr. Cameron Webb.
He is the Director of Health Policy at UVA, has both a medical and law degree, and served on both the Obama administration’s healthcare team and the My Brother’s Keeper Initiative.
Now, polls show him TIED for the lead for Virginia’s GOP-held open seat in the fifth Congressional District and Bob Good is fanning the flames of racism to pull ahead.
This isn’t the first time Bob Good has relied on hatred to advance his political interests, one of his campaign surrogates defended him by saying:<
“You had a black man in the presiden[cy] for eight years and you're crying foul, or white supremacy? You give the devil an inch, and he'll be your ruler. These minorities will not be satisfied.”
We can’t let Bob Good win this race. Now more than ever before, Cameron needs to know we’re with him.
That’s why we told him we would help his campaign raise $50,000 before midnight so he could respond to these disgusting attacks and continue to put in the work organizing locally that will win this race.

Trump is facing a $100 million-plus tax bill for attempting to defraud the IRS— and that’s on top of almost half a billion dollars in loans he personally guaranteed coming due in the next four years.
It’s more clear than ever before: Donald Trump will do anything to hold on to the presidency and avoid accountability for the crimes that built his fortune and allowed him to freeload off the American people.

Friend,
FIRST: AG Barr tried to publicly oust New York Attorney Geoffrey Berman from his post for investigating Trump’s corruption and his buddies like Guiliani and Michael Cohen.
THEN: Trump took matters into his own hands and fired Berman, continuing his dangerous purge of officials who make any attempt to hold his administration accountable for their corruption, sketchy backroom deals, and questionable relationships with foreign powers.
NOW: It’s clear what Trump is up to and it’s time to hold him and his partner in crime — AG Barr — accountable.
NEXT: We need to show Trump and AG Barr the door this November. Barr has made one thing crystal clear: he serves the personal interests of Trump and nobody else. If Barr won’t hold Trump accountable then it’s up to us — the American people.

Alex,
Today is the first day of early voting in Illinois, and I want to tell you about two Cook County candidates who could use your support in the final weeks of the Illinois primary:
Kim Foxx has taken crucial steps in her first term as Cook County State’s Attorney to reform our criminal justice system, declining to prosecute low-level offenders, and pursuing alternatives to prison, all while increasing resources to combat violent gun crimes.
Mike Cabonargi is running for Cook County Clerk of the Circuit Court and is committed to joining Kim in making our criminal justice system fair for everyone. Mike is a proven reformer who fought corruption and fraud as an attorney at the SEC, and I know firsthand that he’s the right person for the job.
Can you contribute $5 today to give Kim and Mike a critical final boost as early voting gets underway?
Illinois prisons are over capacity and our state spends millions of dollars incarcerating low-level offenders -- money that can be better spent on priorities like preventing crime and treating drug addiction.
We’ve made significant strides in the past year at the federal level to ensure fairer sentencing and reduce our incarceration rate. I’m glad to see Kim Foxx making similar progress in Cook County, and I’m eager to see her and Mike Cabonargi continue this important work going forward.
I’m proud to support Kim Foxx and Mike Cabonargi. Please join me in contributing $5 to their campaigns now to support them before Illinois’ primary.
Thank you,
Dick Durbin

Last week, I marched alongside survivors calling for the resignation of Cy Vance as Manhattan DA.
He has perpetuated a two-tiered system that helps powerful men evade justice for sex crimes. Of course, as we know, Cy Vance is not the only one. So many of our leaders have been complicit in a long history of assault against women.
Please sign our petition to demand Cy Vance resign as Manhattan DA.
The abuse of women — and of power — will continue until our elected leaders step up and hold these offenders accountable to the fullest extent of the law.
It was only a couple years ago that Eric Schneiderman sent shockwaves across New York when news broke about his abusive behavior towards women. Yet in an official statement, Rep. Jerry Nadler — who championed Schneiderman into his elected position — said his resignation was the ‘right thing to do.’ He never called for legal action beyond that.
In Eric Schneiderman’s case, resignation was not nearly enough. #MeToo has ushered in a new era. We need a new set of leaders who will fight for justice over protecting their powerful friends.
All my best,
Lindsey

Dear Alex,
Yesterday, Trump sent a letter of desperation to Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats denouncing his imminent impeachment. The letter — which was nothing short of unhinged — included an astonishing reference to me as Rep. Jerry Nadler’s “socialist challenger” who is “driving impeachment.”
As most of you know, I am a progressive Democratic candidate, not a socialist, who knows impeachment is not about partisanship — it is our constitutional duty. And it is the job of every member of Congress to make sure Trump does not get away with his lawless behavior.
I have been calling on Rep. Nadler to impeach President Trump since I announced my candidacy. As Judiciary chair, he has moved too slowly with the impeachment process given his power to act.
Today’s impeachment vote is the least Trump deserves for his rampant abuse of power. His high crimes and misdemeanors are numerous, from ripping migrant families apart at the border, to obstructing justice, to enabling Russian interference in our election, to violating the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. He should face the consequences for all these acts.
We need to get Trump and his defenders out of office so that we can begin to mend this country and focus on critical issues like housing, climate change, jobs, mental health, and healthcare.
As always, thank you so much for your support of my campaign. I can’t fight this fight without you.
All my best,
Lindsey

Alex,
The protests that have erupted across the country have brought the issue of police brutality to the forefront of the public eye. Peaceful protesters across the country are facing violence at the hands of the police and are being arrested even though they have not committed a crime. It has long been a part of my platform to abolish the cash bail system that keeps hundreds of thousands of Americans behind bars before they’ve had a fair trial, simply because they cannot afford bail.
There is so much more we need to do address racism, police brutality, and unlawful arrest, but one thing anyone can do right now is donate to Manhattan’s local bail fund:
Will you donate to COVID Bailout NYC right now?
With COVID-19 still spreading throughout the country, it is not safe for anyone to be incarcerated right now. We should do everything we can to ensure that anyone who can’t afford it, can post bail.
Please rush a donation to COVID Bailout NYC.
This organization is prioritizing the medically vulnerable and people of color. Please join me in supporting this fund. It’s the least we can do.

Dear Alex,
Members of our community are under siege. In the past several weeks, there have been a series of anti-semitic hate crimes across New York City and neighboring areas. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has reported the number of anti-semitic incidents rose almost 60% in the year that Trump took office. Anecdotally, we have witnessed the tragic results of his destructive rhetoric ever since.
On Sunday, I marched in solidarity with thousands of New Yorkers to say the rising hate perpetrated against our Jewish community has no place in New York — or anywhere else. And this fight doesn’t stop with that march. This is only the beginning of the action we’ll take to make sure our communities are safe and civil rights are protected.
Lindsey marching in the No Hate, No Fear walk against anti-semitism
Lindsey speaking about why she's marching against antisemitism.
I felt incredibly hopeful upon seeing so many New Yorkers unite for a common cause — to stand up for our community and uphold common human decency. Together, we sent a strong message to those individuals sowing hatred and division: You will not win.
If you are interested in learning more or supporting this cause, please visit the ADL website.

Friend,
Did you see the latest?
Ilhan Omar attacked the law enforcement community yet again, this time going after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for doing their jobs and deporting dangerous illegal immigrants.
Well, ICE responded, noting that of the 39 illegal immigrants they deported, 36 of them were criminals, with crimes that include “murder, rape, domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, crimes against children, drug trafficking, and conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.”
So just to review. Law enforcement did their job to keep families safe from some of the most vile criminals… and Ilhan Omar attacked them.
We need to beat Ilhan Omar in November. With your help, we can get the job done.

Friend,
At this point, nothing that Ilhan Omar does surprises me, no matter how reckless.
Apparently Ilhan Omar wasn’t satisfied with her attacks on law enforcement.
It’s clear now that her calls to defund the police – which have led to a spike in violent crime in Minneapolis – were just the tip of the iceberg.
And even her assault on our free markets and our entire American system of government were just a start.
Now, she wants a lawless Southern border. Just look at what she posted this weekend:
Make no mistake, the hard-working men and women of ICE protect every single American. Ilhan Omar’s recklessness will open our Southern border to human traffickers, drug smugglers, and MS-13 gang members, putting our lives at risk.
With your help, we’ll defeat Ilhan Omar this November.
It’s time to elect someone who will stand with law enforcement and ICE, someone who believes that America is the greatest nation on the face of the Earth.

Today is #GivingTuesday, a global day of good works and unity. It’s a day for people to come together and give to non-profits in response to the unprecedented need caused by the pandemic.
Chester and Berks Counties have not been spared by COVID-19. Local groups have been working hard to help people get through this crisis, but we still have a long way to go before life returns to normal. There are many organizations doing great work in our communities - too many to name them all. We put together a list of groups in Chester and Berks Counties, as examples, that need your help to continue to serve people affected during this extraordinary time.
Chester County
* Chester County Women’s Services: This group is providing crucial services to families and individuals – providing for children’s basic needs (food, diapers, formula, etc), helping with medical appointments, and providing other basic needs that arise.
* Friends Association for the Care and Protection of Children: Your gift will go directly to helping financially fragile families get through the crisis caused by COVID-19.
* Safe Harbor of Chester County: They offer shelter for men and women, along with meals, laundry access, and support services. They also provide a community lunch daily and a pop-up food pantry six days a week for the food insecure of the County.
* Crisis Victims Center of Chester County: This organization provides services to anyone who has found themselves in a dark situation as a victim of crime. They provide free counselling, victim advocacy, assistance with court hearings/interviews, and financial assistance for anyone who needs help in Chester County.
* Octorara Food Pantry: They provide food for those in need in the southern Chester County community. The need is heightened during this pandemic.
Berks County
* Hope Rescue Mission and the Lighthouse: Providing a place of refuge for the homeless in Berks County. They help people transition back into the community.
* Mercy Ministries: This organization provides Biblically-based peer counseling and support for individuals and families. They provide basic supplies (diapers, wipes, personal hygiene items) as well.
* Salvation Army: They are providing monetary assistance for food, rent, utilities, and medications as well as regular food distributions and homeless support services.
* New Journey Community Outreach: They offer a daily soup kitchen, weekly food pantry, and a weekly clothing handout for individuals and families in the Reading area.
* Olivet Boys and Girls Clubs: Sadly, they have had to close their after school programs but are working hard to provide Grab and Go Dinner and snacks at 8 locations, Monday through Friday, and Family Food Pantry Box giveaways weekly at 4 locations.
Please consider giving a small donation of money, goods, and / or your time. A gift to any of these in our area go a long way to helping others less fortunate.

Impeachment
Following the House vote on impeachment this Wednesday, I released the following statement. You can also find it on my website here.
""The impeachment of a duly-elected President of the United States is something to be undertaken under the most extreme circumstances. Since before President Trump was even sworn into office, Democrats have been advocating for impeachment. The first articles of impeachment were drafted in 2017, just a few months into the president's administration. Today, the Democrats finally voted for two articles of impeachment that include no crime, let alone anything approaching a 'high crime and misdemeanor.' Today, the Democrats have made a mockery of a grave Constitutional responsibility.
""When Chrissy Houlahan ran for Congress in 2018, she promised the voters that she would be different. Her campaign ads bemoaned the 'anger and partisanship' in Washington. She proclaimed herself to be a moderate voice. Over the past two months, she has revealed herself to be just another partisan Democrat, taking a role as a 'leader on impeachment' according to CNN.
""This is a sad day for America. It is a sad day for the voters of the 6th Congressional District who trusted Chrissy Houlahan to live up to her campaign promises. In the end, she turned out to be just another vote for Nancy Pelosi. Chrissy Houlahan needs to be defeated next November. That is what I intend to do.""
On Social Media
Last month we launched a ""Beyond the Bio"" series to help you get to know me as a person and how my unique background has shaped my deeply-held political beliefs.
Be sure to like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter, and find us on Instagram to keep up-to-date with the campaign and see the rest of the ""Beyond the Bio"" series.
In Case You Missed It
﻿When I launched this campaign in September, we released a short video to share why I was running for Congress and to showcase some of the important issues that must be addressed in this election.
I hope you will take a couple of minutes and view the video by clicking here.
I also released a video calling out Chrissy Houlahan. She ran as a so-called ""moderate,"" complaining that ""anger and partisanship"" were the reason Congress wasn't getting anything done. Now she's Nancy Pelosi's leader on impeachment... and Congress isn't getting anything done.
You can watch the full video here. .

Madeleine Dean for Congress
Dear Friend,
Reform and action are necessary from our leaders at every level, and with our collective mourning must come swift action.
That’s why I am standing with Representative Jeffries to support the Eric Garner Effective Use of Force Prevention Act—a bill that bans chokeholds and pressure to the neck by police.
And just this week, I joined my colleagues as an original cosponsor to The Justice in Policing Act of 2020, which will:
* Hold police accountable in our courts
* Improve transparency into policing by collecting better and more accurate data of police misconduct
* Improve police training and practices
* Make lynching a federal crime
Yes, this is long overdue—and it continues to not be enough—but we must take the immediate steps we can with the promise of continued action.
Stand with me by adding your name.
History will repeat itself unless we make a change
Something I cannot get past: If these bills had been passed, we could have immediately held the police responsible accountable for the death of George Floyd.
And for 5 years we have not learned from the death of Eric Garner. But for so much longer we have not listened to Black Americans when they have demanded change.
No longer.
In solidarity,
Madeleine Dean

Texans deserve leadership that will focus on prioritizing the people and taking corruption OUT of office. But time and again we see Republican leaders who put themselves first.

Their time is up, y’all. Leaders like Ron Wright and Ken Paxton — who continue to put their wealthy donors first — have got to go. Let’s finally elect leaders that will lead with dignity and work for the people of Texas by flipping Texas Blue on November 3rd >>>

Hello Alex,
Romney has made it clear: The Establishment CANNOT be trusted to stand strong. He caved. He is putting his personal feelings before the good of the country.
President Trump laid it all out in his brilliant State of the Union last night -- America is thriving! But do career politicians care? NO! Only their careers matter to them. Only their pride.
Romney and his kind would sell out the party faithful just to earn praise from the hacks at The New York Times. He proved that again today with his vote to convict President Trump of a made-up crime.
These kinds of people are at work in the Republican party here in Arizona, too!
They're passing RED FLAG LAWS to confiscate your firearms and selling away LAND RIGHTS to the federal government. We must ACT and vote for a conservative that cares more about convictions and the Constitution than petty power-plays.
If you haven’t yet, CLICK THIS BUTTON and fill out the simple Arizona government form to get DANIEL MCCARTHY on the ballot!
You are all that’s standing between Arizona’s freedom and a future dominated by weak Romney-Republicans. DEMAND Daniel today!
God bless you and your family,
Daniel McCarthy

First of all, a big thank you to everyone who turned out for our big volunteer meeting as we game-planned for August 4th primary voting.
If you missed it and want to catch up, you can watch it here ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️
Let’s talk about a growing problem in Arizona: Liberal politics invading our state, from places like California.
Blue state refugees are moving here in droves, and it's not just the conservatives who are running away from the rampant crime, oppression, and taxes.
Liberals are moving here too, especially into Maricopa County. They haven't quite figured out what doomed their home state and they end up voting for the same policies here in beautiful Arizona.
Even Joe Rogan (a total liberal!) is bailing!
This phenomenon is a special concern to me.
Me and my family are political refugees from a blue state. We came to Arizona because it was a place of FREEDOM where we can own guns, run a business, and raise kids.
We moved here to KEEP ARIZONA RED! Here’s my grandpa, at 92 years old, filling out his ballot to DEMAND DANIEL in this primary in hopes to save the state he loves.
Because he knows the truth: if Arizona falls, there’s no where left to run.
DONATE $25 HERE TO KEEP ARIZONA RED!
So what can we do? Well, we need ACTION ON A FEDERAL LEVEL. We need a senator who will make sure laws are passed that enshrine the 2nd Amendment so that no liberal vote can take it away.
We need a senator who will put his own boots on the ground at our southern border and DEMAND A WALL so that no liberal vote can create “sanctuary cities.”
And we need a senator who will, on a federal level, restore the constitution to its position of authority so that conservatives across the country no longer have to live in fear.
That’s what I will do. Can Martha McSally say the same?
On August 4th, GO VOTE AND DEMAND DANIEL!
Our state’s future is depending on it.

Michael Flynn has prevailed! And so have we! Conservatives, this is the beginning of a movement. The layers of sludge and corruption in the D.C. Swamp are being pushed away.
When I’m your senator, I will make it a priority EVERY DAY to root out the abuses of people like that lying snake James Comey.
I need your help to do it. Please consider donating to my campaign, even as little as $10, so that we can expand our campaign’s reach further across Arizona.
We must return true love of America and the Constitution to our leadership! If they lied about Flynn, what else have they done? Who else have they hurt?
Unelected LEFTISTS hidden away in government agencies deciding whether or not you or I or General Flynn get to walk around free or are locked away for process crimes. It would make our founders sick.
They can’t keep getting away with it. Let’s take this victory, Alex, and show them what the conservatives of Arizona can do! Get involved with a donation or by volunteering for the campaign.
We’re going to drain this Swamp together.

Alex,
My Name is Teddy Daniels and I am asking for your help to fight the corrupt Democrats and unseat an incumbent Democrat Congressman here in Pennsylvania.
I am a wounded combat vet with a Purple Heart. So you know that I'll fight for our freedoms - even if I'm taking flak!
I'm a former cop and a blue-collar guy. My district, North Eastern PA is a blue-collar area. That's why Donald Trump won it by 10 points in 2016 - all because he shoots straight, even if it offends some. He does what needs to be done and says what needs to be said.
That's why he is the legend and the President. He fights for us!
Here in Pennsylvania - a state Trump won in 2016 - we are fighting some of the worst corruption and abuse of power by the Democrats that we've ever seen.
Democrat Governor Wolf is on a power trip, with an unconstitutional lockdown order he wants in place indefinitely. Anyone who disagrees gets threatened by him:
Hours later, Wolf threatened in an extraordinary news conference to punish a growing number of counties that vowed to let businesses reopen against his orders.
He pledged to withhold coronavirus aid from them and branded them “cowards,” saying they are “choosing to desert in the face of the enemy, in the middle of a war that we Pennsylvanians are winning and that we must win.”
Wolf — who hasn’t spoken one cross word about Trump or the White House’s handling of the outbreak — also warned that business owners could lose certificates and licenses to operate, and face insurance sanctions.
That order also made our elections vote-by-mail, over the objections of our Republican state legislature.
Why would the Democrat Governor slip this sudden rule change in?
Image
Here's why:
A former Judge of Elections in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has been charged and pleaded guilty to illegally adding votes for Democrat candidates in judicial races in 2014, 2015, and 2016.
On Thursday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced charges against former Judge of Elections Domenick DeMuro, 73, for stuffing the ballot box for Democrats in exchange for payment by a paid political consultant.
The charges, and guilty plea, include conspiracy to deprive Philadelphia voters of their civil rights by fraudulently stuffing the ballot boxes for specific Democrat candidates in the 2014, 2015, and 2016 primary elections and a violation of the Travel Act.
“The Trump administration’s prosecution of election fraud stands in stark contrast to the total failure of the Obama Justice Department to enforce these laws,” Public Interest Legal Foundation President Christian Adams said in a statement. “Right now, other federal prosecutors are aware of cases of double voting in federal elections as well as noncitizen voting. Attorney General William Barr should prompt those other offices to do their duty and prosecute known election crimes.”
Wolf wants mail in balloting because the Dems are stuffing the ballot boxes! How can we possibly have any confidence in this guy when he himself was fraudulently elected?
I think this whole COVID response by Wolf was a big ploy to throw Pennsylvania's elections in 2020.
It's sure as heck wasn't about health! After all, he forced COVID-positive patients into nursing homes, where 70% of PA's deaths from COVID took place.
[Wolf's order] stated:
Nursing care facilities must continue to accept new admissions and receive readmissions for current residents who have been discharged from the hospital who are stable to alleviate the increasing burden in the acute care settings. This may include stable patients who have had the COVID-19 virus.
Nearly 70 percent of the state’s coronavirus-related deaths — 2,896 of 4,218 — are connected to nursing home facilities.
His own incompetent ""Health"" Secretary pulled his own mother from nursing homes, and then forced thousands of COVID-infected patients into nursing homes, resulting in thousands of deaths.
Are YOU ready to stop this insanity yet? Are you ready to stop incompetence, corruption, and tyranny in Pennsylvania - and win the state again for President Trump?
What we need is a FIGHTER - and I am that fighter!!!!!
Image
I'm a fighter and I'm here to fight for you. I have broad shoulders, let me carry your voice for you. Let me carry your voice to the House of Representatives and stand up to these crazy liberal governors.
When you get tired of a bunch of incompetent extremists who are literally killing senior citizens to serve their political whims, call on me to stand up for you.
Many people are standing with me against these limousine liberals.
I have collected a slew of great endorsements, including FreedomWorks, Bikers for Trump, the National Association for Gun Rights, NE PA Women for Trump, and Vets for Trump. They trust me to carry the banner for Trump Conservatives in DC!
Image
Help me fight tyranny here in Pennsylvania! Now I need YOUR help by sending whatever you can to help our effort before the critical end of this month. I am $4,850 short of my goal, and need your help to get there!
To flip this Blue seat to Red, I'll be relying on YOU! I love this country and want to stop these crazy Democrats who have politicized the COVID crisis to try to impose radical Socialism on us.
Help me take this seat in Congress. Let's send a BIG message to the Socialists like Governor Wolf and Matt Cartwright. Trump will win PA, and we will retake this Trump +10 seat!
Again, I'm Teddy Daniels. I'm running for United States Congress and my election is just days away. I need any help you can give me to send the Swamp packing - from $15, $35, 60, 100, 250 or whatever you can afford!
We need to take it to the Dems RIGHT NOW. Time is fleeting, so thank you for your help and let's take back the House!
Respectfully Yours,

Nixon only had one Friday Night Massacre. This presidency has given us so many Friday Night Massacres that we’ve lost count.
Now, William Barr and Donald Trump tried to illegally remove the chief prosecutor investigating Trump’s crimes in New York — and a constitutional crisis was only averted when the prosecutor willingly stepped down after the fact.

What was once unprecedented, undemocratic, and impeachable has become business as usual under Trump and Attorney General Barr. They think they can get away with intervening in the work of a prosecutor investigating Trump’s finances and misconduct.

This election will determine whether Trump faces any consequences for his misconduct. Thanks to enablers like Van Taylor, the risk of him getting away with it is all too real.

Laura Loomer for Congress
Patriot,
Joe Biden made his unsurprising announcement that Kamala Harris will be his Vice Presidential running mate.
I’ve dealt with Kamala Harris and exposed her blatant political corruption back in 2017 as an investigative journalist.
Of course, the Mainstream Media didn’t run with the story at the time so let me tell you a bit about what I uncovered.
In October of 2016, Trump supporter and activist, Mark Feigin was arrested and charged by then California Attorney General Kamala Harris for making “criminal threats” and “annoying phone calls” to an Islamic Center.
It turns out, Feigin didn’t make the calls, but I found out who did, and I published the police interviews that took place with the real culprit.
Despite Mr. Feigin being TOTALLY cleared of the false accusations, Kamala wouldn’t stop and demanded he sign a plea agreement that required 5 years of formal probation, and community service that would be SUPERVISED BY A MUSLIM GROUP.
Kamala Harris also demanded that Mark Feigin denounce the “Alt-Right” even though he was never associated with it.
That’s right, Kamala Harris demanded a U.S. Citizen denounce beliefs after falsely charging him with a hate crime.
Kamala is the poster child of political corruption and with her elevation to the #2 most powerful Democrat in the nation, you can rest assured that AOC, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and every other power-hungry Democrat in Congress will emulate Kamala’s model to use the government against political adversaries.
And I plan on being in Congress in 2021 to stop them. Help me get there today.
We’re days away from Primary Day in Florida and my eyes are set on the General Election and meeting our fundraising goals to win in November.
We have $36,725 left to raise before Primary Day. Will you chip in $10 today and ask a friend to do the same?
Our General Election media blitz needs to be funded with a war chest to compete against my Democrat opponent and any amount you can donate will help us get there. Chip in $10, $20 or whatever you can afford.
Kamala Harris will be the new corrupt “attack dog” of the Left as Joe Biden can’t even string along a sentence and she’ll spawn a dozen wannabe’s in Congress who will be hell-bent on destroying or silencing any conservative who challenges them.
But they’ve tried that with me . . . for years.
They failed, I’m still here and they know that when they send their attack dogs after me, they’re the ones who get bitten.
Send me to Washington by donating today.
Thank you again for all that you do.

Four years ago today, ISIS terrorist Omar Mateen gunned down 49 people in the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Florida.
Following the terrorist attack, the media and Democrat politicians labeled it a hate crime against the LGBTQ community and immediately began the call to restrict our Second Amendment rights.
But their narrative was misleading.
After failing to gain entry to Disney World, Mateen’s original target, he chose Pulse nightclub as the location of his terrorist attack.
The Islamic terrorist was outraged by the killing of ISIS leader Abu Waheeb a month earlier, which is why he stormed the gay nightclub, massacring 49 people, holding others hostage, while pledging allegiance to ISIS.
But democrats still deny it was an act of Islamic terrorism to this day.
Ilhan Omar posted on Twitter, ""Let’s remember the attack for what it was: a hate crime against the LGBTQIA+ community.""
Just hours ago, Nancy Pelosi called it a ""shocking act of hatred.""
Other Democrats like my opponent Lois Frankel are refusing to admit this was an act of Islamic terrorism, and are instead attacking law abiding gun owners.
Islamic Terrorism doesn’t fit the narrative of Democrats in this critical election year. Their ""hate America"" agenda bolsters terrorists and some Democrats like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib work directly with groups that are officially designated as terrorist organizations. Ilhan Omar once advocated for nine men in her district who joined ISIS, asking a judge to lessen their sentencing.
This is why I’m headed to Washington. And I need your help to get there.
Help me honor the American lives lost to Islamic Terrorism by allowing me to actively fight against those who would go so far as to change the narrative to fit their agenda.
I have to go back to Ilhan Omar’s quote, ""Let’s remember the attack for what it was . . . ""
That’s a shameful, outrageous lie!
FOURTY-NINE lives were lost on this day four years ago. FOURTY-NINE men and women were stalked and many were shot at point blank range by an ISIS TERRORIST.
Let’s not forget the attack for what it was . . . ISLAMIC TERRORISM.
Help me get to Washington so that next year, on the fifth anniversary of this attack, I can remind Ilhan Omar and hand her the names of the men and women killed by an ISIS terrorist.
Thank you again for all that you do.
Respectfully,
Laura Loomer

874,"Donald Trump has overturned a fair-housing rule.
Dana Balter for Congress
Friend,
Disgusting.
Disgusting is how I would describe Donald Trump’s most recent racist, divisive, and extreme rhetoric -- when he took to Twitter to boast about overturning an Obama-era rule created to combat housing discrimination.
Trump tweets: ""I am happy to inform all of the people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your [[URL REDACTED]] housing prices will go up based on the market, and crime will go down. I have rescinded the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. Enjoy!""
Here are the facts:
* The 1968 Fair Housing Act was created to prohibit discrimination based on race, color, national origin -- later including religion, sex, familial status, and disability.
* The 2015 Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) rule was created to combat modern-day segregation by requiring local governments to identify and address patterns of discrimination outlined in the Fair Housing Act.
* Now, Donald Trump is rolling back protections in our own communities and stoking the fires of hatred.
We cannot afford to move our country backward -- instead, we should listen to the diverse voices in our communities and take action to dismantle systemic racism and discrimination. Please sign our petition to tell Donald Trump to reverse course and re-enact the AFFH rule.
ADD YOUR NAME »
The divisiveness in his language -- shamelessly connecting criminal activity to low-income housing -- is repugnant.
American values mean equal opportunities; American values mean protections from discrimination; American values mean welcoming everyone regardless of who you are or where you come from.
But we have a president who wants to actively undermine policies and institutions that are used to combat racism and discrimination. And this is the man that my opponent, Congressman John Katko, endorses.
So we need to speak out against this blatant bigotry. We need to reaffirm the principle that everyone deserves a fair shot to succeed and share in prosperity and security -- our true American values.
Please join me and sign your name to support fair housing.
Onward,
Dana

875,"John Katko is shirking his responsibility in the face of an unprecedented assault against our democracy by Donald Trump.
Friend, we're just 80 days away from the biggest election of our lifetimes.
Not only must we defeat a racist, corrupt president who is using the executive branch to undermine our democratic institutions; we must hold accountable the lawmakers who had the opportunity to put their country first, but instead chose political expediency.
John Katko had a choice last year, when clear evidence of Trump's impeachable crimes was out in the open. He made the choice to vote against holding Trump accountable -- and then endorse him for re-election.
The recent public efforts by Donald Trump to sabotage the U.S. Postal Service and suppress mail-in voting are disgraceful, but they're not at all surprising in light of what we learned last year. Members of Congress -- like John Katko -- who supported Donald Trump then are responsible for what is happening now.
The race for NY-24 is our chance to send a message that failing to protect our democracy in office has a price at the ballot box. Together, we can do that in 80 days.

Friend,
After the horrific hate crime in Monsey where five people were stabbed at a rabbi’s home during Chanukah, I posted a series of tweets responding to the attacks and the rise of anti-Semitism in our country.
@dana_balter Pay attention. We know where this leads. My grandparents fled Austria because of where this leads. More than six million of us were slaughtered because of where this leads. 1/ 12:40 PM · Dec 29, 2019 Condemning this attack is not enough. Taking this opportunity to say “anti-Semitism is bad” or “hate has no place here” is not enough. Saying you “stand in solidarity” with your “Jewish brothers and sisters” is not enough.   2/Make no mistake, what happened in #Monsey isn't just because of a bad man with a machete. When the president uses historically anti-semetic language-like “America first” & fighting “globalists”-to frame his views & rile his base & you say nothing, you're helping this happen.  3/When the president says that Jews who didn’t vote for him are disloyal and you say nothing, you are helping this happen. When the president calls white nationalists chanting Nazi slogans “very fine people” and you say nothing, you are helping this happen.  4/Allies are not the people who mourn your tragedies with you. Allies are the people who take a stand, who use their power and their voices to speak up and speak out when it’s difficult, when it may cost them something but they do it anyway because it’s right. Be an ally.   5/5
On the one hand, the hateful responses I received didn't surprise me because I'm a Jewish woman in the United States of America -- this is not my first experience of anti-Semitism.
On the other hand, they shocked me because they were so vile and so virulent, and a very sad indicator of serious and widespread trends we need to confront in our country. We have to acknowledge this is happening. This is not an isolated incident.
We have a president who regularly spews this kind of hatred while praising other people who do the same. He is actively fostering an environment of hate.
History has shown us over and over and over again that when you foster an environment where these kinds of verbal and physical assaults are not only accepted but are excused, we end up in very serious trouble.
Will you join me in speaking out and speaking up against the rise of hate in our country? If you’re with me, add your name to help us reach 10,000 signatures.
I learned as a young child from my family's history that silence is complicity.

878,"Trump just issued pardons and commutations to individuals who personify the corruption that we need to get out of our government.
Dana Balter for Congress
Team,
As Donald Trump has continued his assault on the rule of law, the response from John Katko has been revealing.
When Trump interfered in the Roger Stone case? Crickets. When Trump commuted Rod Blagojevich, the former governor of Illinois who was convicted of a pay-to-play scheme involving a U.S. Senate seat? Crickets. When Trump said, ""I am the chief law enforcement officer""? Crickets.
As a former federal prosecutor, Katko knows how dangerous this is for democracy. If only he would show an ounce of the courage of the four DOJ prosecutors who resigned after Trump got involved in the Stone case. Or the more than 2000 former DOJ officials who called on Attorney General Bill Barr to resign.
Here's the fact of the matter: when Katko and his Republican colleagues refused to hold Trump accountable for his impeachable crimes, they gave a green light for further abuses of power. So if we're going to fight Trump's corruption, we need to defeat the members of Congress who've quietly (or loudly) condoned it.
That's why I'm asking for your help today. Can you donate $10 to help us stay on track for our critical February goal? We need to raise $10,442 more by the end of the month.

879,"Once again, Donald Trump has lowered the bar for presidential standards by granting clemency to his close friend and political ally Roger Stone -- despite a jury convicting Stone of lying to Congress, witness tampering, and obstructing a congressional committee proceeding.
Let's get one thing straight: this country has two separate justice systems: one for the powerful and one for the poor.
Because of Stone's proximity to the President, he will not serve a single day of his 40-month sentence. Meanwhile, Black and Brown folks are sent to prison for petty, non-violent crimes every single day.
This is why people across our country continue to protest in the streets.
This is why people are demanding major reforms to our criminal justice system.
So, the next time President Trump refers to BLM activists as ""thugs,"" remember that it's Trump and his right-wing cronies who have jeopardized our democracy and made a mockery of our judicial system for personal gain.
As long I'm serving the people of CA-38, I promise to stand up to President Trump's selfish actions, hypocritical agenda, and ignorant policies. To do that, however, I need to win re-election in November. Will you help ramp up my campaign efforts so I can continue to hold the President accountable?

Last night, President Trump made blatantly racist comments on Fox News attacking low-income families and — once again — Cory himself:
""They were trying to destroy the suburban beautiful [[URL REDACTED]] want low income housing and with that comes a lot of other problems including crime. If Biden gets in... you know who's going to be in charge of it? Cory Booker — that's going to be nice...""
Trump is literally trying to scare suburban voters by the mere thought of low-income families moving into — or in his words, bringing crime to — their neighborhood. That's about as ugly as it gets.
This country has a deeply painful history of housing discrimination. In 1969, Cory's own parents relied on the help of a white couple posing as them in order to purchase their home in what was a predominantly white suburban New Jersey neighborhood. Their ability to purchase that home forever impacted Cory's life in a positive way, but not every family has that opportunity.
This president is using racist and hateful language to rally up his base and create fear. It's not only divisive, it's dangerous.
Show Trump we reject his dangerous comments: rush $10 or more to stand with Cory today.

Team, did you read Cory's message last week about the new bill he introduced?
In direct response to the nationwide calls for police reform and justice for Black lives, Cory introduced the Justice in Policing Act, which would ban chokeholds, create a national database of police misconduct, and much more.
Our country has gone far too long without any significant reform to address the growing epidemic of police violence against Black Americans. Join Cory in calling for change by urging the Senate to pass his bill today.
ADD YOUR NAME
Friend,
Since the tragic murder of George Floyd at the hands of police, the calls for justice have been loud and clear. Now is the time for policy change and legislative action.
That's why I'm a partner in the effort, along with Kamala Harris and Democratic Congressional leaders, to introduce the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, a set of comprehensive reforms that will create stronger systems of transparency and accountability while bringing needed reform to police departments across the country.
If you're ready for transformative change to America's policing, add your name right now to become a co-sponsor of this new legislation.
ADD YOUR NAME
As millions of Americans have continued to rise up and unite for justice in every corner of the country, I've spent the past few weeks working closely with Senator Harris as well as the Congressional Black Caucus to develop legislation that will address the unchecked bias and lack of accountability in our nation's police departments.
This bill is just the first step to stopping the gut-wrenching injustices that have taken the lives of too many Black Americans for decades on end.
It aims to shine a light on abuse and corruption by creating a federal database of police misconduct, and strengthening the consequences for such actions by ending the ""qualified immunity"" that has long protected police officers from being held accountable for violating a person's rights.
It would also prevent the escalation and brutality that killed George Floyd and Breonna Taylor by prohibiting chokeholds, banning no-knock warrants in drug cases, and putting an end to racial and religious profiling.
And finally, at long last, lynching would become a federal crime.
It's been decades since legislation to reform policing like this has been introduced in Washington, and quite frankly it's long overdue. Ending systemic racism will not happen overnight or with one bill, but through this legislation, we can make real progress.
Join me in supporting the passage of these critical police reforms by adding your name now.

Together, let's rise and reform the system so we can end the institutionalized violence against Black lives in America.

We can’t believe it, but President Trump just attacked Cory AGAIN team — the third time in a matter of a week.
Last night at his political rally in Iowa — which defied CDC guidance and put hundreds of people at risk in the middle of a pandemic — Trump came for Cory by saying “stupid people like Cory Booker,"" and then mocked Newark, New Jersey.
Clearly Trump is reaching here, given the fact that Cory is a Rhodes Scholar who loves the city of Newark where he successfully ushered in an economic boom, drove down crime, and rooted out corruption during his tenure as Mayor.
Let’s show Trump once again that the people have Cory’s back, especially now that we’re only 19 days away from Election Day. Pitch in $10 or more to support Cory’s re-election and efforts to flip the Senate in less than three weeks:

Today is Juneteenth. President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation to declare an end to the vile institution of slavery in America in 1862. But, many enslaved people were still held captive even after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed.
On June 19, 1865, the word of freedom finally reached a community of enslaved people in Galveston, Texas. It was on that day that Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, arrived in Galveston to declare freedom for the people who were still enslaved. It had taken nearly two and a half years for this news to travel to the hundreds of thousands of enslaved people still remaining in Texas.
The celebration of rejoice and reunion that followed is one we continue to this day.
On this Juneteenth, I am taking time to remember our history, to rejoice in the progress we have made and reflect on the enormity of the work we have left to do.
The truth is that even once Black Americans were emancipated, our ancestors continued to face enormous barriers: to live free from racism and racialized violence, to work with dignity, to vote, to build wealth and economic security for themselves and for future generations.
Today, as those barriers remain, so must our commitment to justice.
That is why I am working to push Congress to act to take the transformative steps needed to address the hate and systemic racism that is still so deeply rooted in our laws and institutions. We must finally make lynching a federal crime, reform our criminal justice system, and critically, intervene to create more transparent and accountable police departments.
The injustices we must confront are interrelated: from environmental injustice that disproportionately affects Black Americans to disparities in health access and outcomes to the staggering racial wealth gap that disadvantages Black families. We have so much work to do.
Today, as I honor the sacrifices made by my ancestors and rejoice in their grace and relentless hope for this country, I renew my commitment to fighting for true justice and equality for all.
I hope you will join me.

It's been decades since legislation to reform policing like this has been introduced in Washington, and quite frankly it's long overdue. Ending systemic racism will not happen overnight or with one bill, but through this legislation, we can make real progress.
Join me in supporting the passage of these critical police reforms by adding your name now.
ADD YOUR NAME
Together, let's rise and reform the system so we can end the institutionalized violence against Black lives in America.

Friend,
It shouldn’t be much a surprise by this point, but Jeff Van Drew has been officially named as one of Trump’s top national fundraisers.
While New Jersey is struggling through this pandemic – a pandemic made worse by their inaction – they’re out cashing checks from billionaires, corporations, and anyone else who wants a favor from the Trump crime organization.
It’s tone-deaf, it’s slimy, and it’s a perfect fit for someone like Jeff Van Drew. He’s a practiced opportunist who will do whatever it takes to hold on to power – just like Donald Trump.
We believe there’s important work to do. If you agree, we need your support to elect Brigid Callahan Harrison and send Jeff Van Drew home. Remember, Cook’s Political Report called this seat “the most likely to flip” from red to blue. Please contribute whatever you’re able.

Friend,
We hope this find you safe and we’ll. As our nation faces this crisis, the need for strong leadership has never been more apparent or lacking. Here in South Jersey, part of the problem lies with my opponent, Jeff Van Drew.
Jeff Van Drew has become infamous for his high-profile defection from the Democratic party. When Trump was under fire for crimes against our nation, Jeff shirked his responsibility and decided to embrace Trump and his criminal acts.
What else do you know about Jeff Van Drew? If you’re like most people, not much. He’s an easily forgettable back-bencher with no real legislative accomplishments to highlight. Even worse, he actively worked against the interests of working people even before he bowed down before Donald Trump.
That’s why Brigid got into this race. She saw that Jeff Van Drew had abandoned his constituents long before he abandoned his party. That’s why she’s been endorsed by Senator Cory Booker, Senator Robert Menendez, New Jersey’s largest newspaper, and it’s why she’s earned the support of thousands all over the district. They know that this is our chance to elect a real leader to Congress.
Jeff Van Drew has to go and Brigid is the candidate to win this race – click here to make it happen.
Our quarterly deadline is tomorrow at midnight and your support is critical. As our nation faces one of the biggest challenges of our lifetime, it’s more important than ever for us to have real leaders who will fight the Trump agenda.

Thanks so much for your support.

# Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for Congress
Alex, right-wing media outlets are at it again. Whenever AOC speaks about systematic injustice, they ramp up their efforts to silence her. But this time, their outrage is truly absurd.
On a recent livestream, AOC talked about the connection between poverty and crime – a fact that any expert on the subject would agree with. But right wing pundits lost it, accusing her of making excuses for violent crime.
Their motivation is transparent. They couldn’t defeat AOC by donating to a corporate primary challenger, so now they’re trying to bully our movement into silence. We won’t let that happen. Will you donate $3 to help us fight back against these right-wing attacks?
Donate $3
A $6 billion budget for the NYPD has done nothing to stop the spike in crime that we’ve seen in NYC. Meanwhile, countless folks from across the city still haven’t received their economic stimulus checks. Tens of thousands of New Yorkers are facing eviction. One in six children in NYC public schools is homeless.
Those are the facts. Crime is a symptom of a society that neglects its most marginalized people, and alleviating that problem requires the passage of critical progressive policies that AOC has fought for since day one. But that reality runs counter to the narrative of too many right-wing politicians who just want to increase police funding and decrease accountability.
So they’re doing everything they can to delegitimize us and shut out our message. Help us fight back by donating $3 to bolster this movement right now.
Thanks for your support,
Team AOC

Democratic Primary
June 23, 2020
Congressional District 02
""The system is alive and well in Washington D.C. and we must be prepared for the next time, both medically and financially.""
""I will help the district heal from our health and financial crisis.""
Amityville, N.Y. -- Patricia Maher is running for Congress to help bring our health and economy back. Maher is in a primary on June 23, 2020. Maher is the only one in the race who is not a career elected official. ""All of the other candidates are career elected officials and have their allegiance to the system, not the voters,"" said Maher. ""The system has failed us, some of us are sick and most of us are out of work. People who only two months ago were employed are standing on food lines. The COVID-19 Pandemic has temporarily taken the life that we knew away from us. ""The one thing we don't need is more career elected officials,"" said Maher. ""The system is so jaded against upstarters that I never received most of the endorsement applications that my opponent did.""
Maher has spent her life around health care. Maher is the daughter of a nurse, she has a law degree from Touro Law Center in Central Islip and is presently doing research towards an LL.M. in Health Care and Policy at Hofstra University. ""Congress makes laws and a Congresswoman needs be able to write laws to help the district,” said Maher. “The unfortunate part about some laws are that elected officials don’t understand them, read them or even participate in writing them, and then they vote to pass these laws,” said Maher.
We need real women in Congress, that have the experience and education to make laws, not more career elected officials. I am a political activist, graduate of the Touro Law Center in Central Islip with a J.D. and daughter of a single working mother. My mother was a Cadet Navy Nurse from WW II. Born and raised on Long Island, Maher’s parents were divorced when she was younger. Her mother worked in the hospital during the day and then traveled to New York City at night to earn her Doctorate in Nursing Education at Teacher’s College, Columbia University.
Maher has worked for the residents of both Nassau and Suffolk Counties while in the Bankruptcy and Foreclosure Clinic at Touro Law in Central Islip. ""I helped individuals fight to keep their homes and assets,"" said Maher. “People were facing foreclosures and the banks just didn't care. I helped advocate for them so they could receive a second chance.""
Patricia did her externship in the long island criminal division in the United States Attorney’s Office, Eastern District of New York, Central Islip. ""Drug addiction and crime are apart of everyday life for some in the district and I wanted to help protect the community by learning from the top prosecutors.""
“I’m not a Washington insider. I ran for Congress against Peter King as the Democratic Candidate in 2014 with little support from the Washington insiders. Very few wanted to run against Peter King back then, so I took the challenge,” said Maher.
One of my priorities is to advocate for more industry and federal funding for Long Island, which equates to real jobs that pay for a mortgage and rent,” said Maher. "" The Paycheck Protection Act was supposed to help small business, but in reality helped big business. There were countless small business owners who have laid off all their staff, can’t reopen, still trying to collect unemployment and will lose their business because of a poorly worded Program that was supposed to help small business.
“I agree with Governor Cuomo’s law “ Americans First Law,” but I would go further and say that businesses that received federal funds must hire New York employees and those New York employees that want to go back to work,” said Maher. “Many companies will continue working remotely and could potentially hire employees at lower wages, independent contractors with no insurance rights at the cost of New York workers. The words make a difference.”
“I will help the district heal from both the health and financial crisis that COVID-19 has created,” said Maher. “My first priority is to meet with our frontline workers including, nurses, physicians, hospital administrators, store clerks, grocery store workers, pharmacists, restaurant employees, sanitation workers, bank employees, social workers and essential workers, including teachers, and small to mid-size business owners.” “They are all essential to claiming back the life that we once knew. We can never be caught off-guard again. I will work with the local elected and state officials to prepare.

890,"Dear Alex,
I am Sandy Smith, the Republican nominee for Congress in North Carolina’s newly redrawn 1st Congressional district.
I am a patriot who has had it with unconstitutional lockdown orders, given by liberal Trump-hating socialist Democrats who are trying to tank the economy to hurt the President politically.
Mean-spirited left-wing partisan hack governors have been punishing ordinary citizens all across the country, for the ""crime"" of trying to feed their families and avoid losing their businesses.
Image
In Michigan, their Democrat Governor is persecuting small businesses like a 77-year old barber:
State regulators on Wednesday suspended the license of a 77-year-old Michigan barber who insisted on cutting hair despite an order to stay closed during the coronavirus pandemic.
Karl Manke has pledged to keep his shop open “until Jesus comes.” A judge declined the state’s request to shut down his shop Monday without first holding a hearing. Regulators took a different path by suspending his barber license and his shop license.
In Oregon, their governor sent Child Protective Services to harass a small business owner who tried to open in defiance of their Democrat governor's order:
Oregon Occupational Safety and Health issued a $14,000 fine to Lindsey Graham, owner of Glamor Salon in Salem, for reopening her salon May 5 in defiance of Gov. Kate Brown's stay-home order.
""I'm being threatened and intimidated and bullied daily by the government,"" Graham said during a press conference Friday. ""I'm sad that I can drive 20 minutes down the freeway, and that person's job as a hairstylist is essential, according to Kate Brown. But my job, 20 minutes up the street, is nonessential.""
""I don't want anyone to get sick. I know you guys don't want anyone to get sick,"" Graham said. ""But I also don't want to go bankrupt and lose everything I worked for and neither do you.""
She also claimed that Child Protective Services had visited her house and questioned her child. ""I've never expected such a violent, aggressive, vindictive thing could ever be done to me or my family,"" she said, ""because I'm trying to earn a living, because I'm trying to work.""
Here in North Carolina, we have another one of these abusive governors, Roy Cooper.
This guy is every bit the tinpot dictator that the governors of Michigan and Oregon are. You may recall that the Republican National Convention (which I will attend as a Trump delegate!) is in Charlotte, NC in August:
President Donald Trump this week accused North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper of “playing politics” with reopening the state, and said it would be “bad for them” if the state were to delay the start of the Republican National Convention in Charlotte.
“No, no,” Trump replied. “We’ll have a convention. I’m a traditionalist, but we’ll have to see, like everything else, but I think we’ll be in good shape by that time. We have a great state, North Carolina, that’s been very, very good.
“Although, it’s got a Democrat governor, so we have to be a little bit careful. It’s got a Democrat governor, so we have to be a little bit careful with that, because they’re playing politics. They’re playing politics, as you know, by delaying the openings. ... To me that’s politics. They think it’s a bad thing for me if they delay the opening. I think it’s bad for them. And you have people protesting outside, and those people like Trump.”
Image
Our hyper-partisan governor would cancel the RNC if he thought he could get away with it. That's how these tyrannical Democrat governors roll. I have never met anyone so lost in what he is doing. A lost socialist is very very dangerous because you combine incompetence with bad left wing policy at the same time.
I've had it with these people. It is now abundantly clear that their motives were NEVER to keep anyone safe or healthy. It's to accumulate power for themselves, punish those who work for a living to support their families, and tank the economy for the election.
I am disgusted and shocked by their actions. No red-blooded American should ever stand for tyranny, and no one should stand for political-fueled retributions, either.
If you are proud of our president, as I am, I need YOUR help urgently to defeat my high-level radical socialist Democrat opponent and retake this swing seat!
Let's send a message to the Socialist NC governor. Let's show these tyrants that they can't get away with this.
I am proud of those who are standing to fight with me. I have already been endorsed by Congressman Mark Walker, Congressman Ted Budd, and Congressman Mark Meadows. Here is a picture of me and Mark Meadows. Congressman Meadows used to be Chairman of the Freedom Caucus, and now he is the President Trump’s Chief of Staff in the White House. He “proudly endorsed” me shortly before his promotion, which I was so honored!
Image
President Trump has accomplished so much with constant pushback from the socialists, like these governors. Imagine what he can do with a supportive Congress!
It is so crucial that we take advantage of every chance we have to flip a swing district \- which North Carolina’s First District now is! They just redrew the map and took away a bunch of Democrat voters, making this district MUCH more competitive.
But this year, this district turned into a swing district. Half of the district has never been represented by Butterfield. They don’t know him, and they are Republicans!
Will you help me beat Butterfield and deprive Nancy Pelosi of a reliable vote? I need you to send $15, $35, or $250 right now so that I can meet my goal by the end of this month. This deadline is so critical, and I have no time to lose.
I will NEVER vote with Nancy Pelosi! She and her insane leftist agenda can pound sand!
Can you help me take this swing district back, with your best and immediate contribution of $15, $35, or $250? Taking out one of Pelosi’s leading lieutenants would be a major, crippling blow to the socialist anti-American left and to Nancy Pelosi’s agenda. Please rush back your supporting contribution today. Thank you.
G.K. Butterfield is a leftist extremist, not a patriot, but to replace him I really need your help. I appreciate you and thank you.
For God and Country,

891,"Dear Alex,
I am Sandy Smith, the Republican nominee for Congress in North Carolina’s newly redrawn 1st Congressional district.
As you may know, I come from a military family- including my husband and my children. My family has a legacy of service to keeping the American people safe.
Let me be clear: those who seek to riot and burn, then to blame our brave police for their violence and mistakes, CANNOT be allowed to ""defund the police""!
These riots were never ""peaceful protests"". They were grotesquely violent: over 150 killed, over 20 cops killed, hundreds of businesses and homes burned.
Image
Three black cops and several black civilians were murdered by the rioters, meaning that it was likely never about ""black lives matter"" in the first place.
Of course, it was never just protesters. Antifa, foreign actors and what Bill Barr called a ""witch's brew"" of bad actors drove the violence, arson and murder.
The federal officials gathered with Mr. Barr said they’re tracking the violence nationwide, pointing to investigations into more than 800 arsons and 76 explosive devices at protests. They described the violent actors behind them, from Antifa to the far-right Boogaloo movement.
Mr. Barr called it a “witch’s brew,” and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said different groups are involved in different cities.
Underpinning some of the dissension are the same foreign actors who have tried to meddle in American politics in the past, the officials said — though they didn’t name specific countries nor say exactly what they’ve seen.
Mr. Barr said they are “playing all sides to exacerbate the violence.”
“I believe we have evidence that some foreign hackers and groups associated with foreign governments are focused on this particular situation we have here and exacerbate it every way they can,” he said.
So, possibly Russians or Iranians or ISIS are stirring up a revolution on our streets from young extreme leftists who are murdering cops.
But actually, it's worse than that.
Antifa may be useful idiots to the Russians, but President Trump is not fooled. He is taking on that threat head on!
Image
Sensing weakness in Democrat politicians like New York's DeBlasio, or Chicago's Lightfoot, these Antifa rioters have begun to list demands.... starting with defunding- or eliminating- the police.
Already Minneapolis is disbanding the police, urged on by the odious Ilhan Omar:
Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar went beyond calls to defund the police following the death of George Floyd, instead calling for dismantling the Minneapolis Police Department because it is “rotten to the root.”
“We need to completely dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department. Because here’s the thing, there’s a cancer,” she said, continuing that amputation is needed so it doesn’t spread.
Now, anyone who was paying attention knows that these radicals have wanted to get rid of the police all along, so they wouldn't pay for the crimes they committed while rioting.
Can you imagine how things would go with no police to answer the 911 calls?
If your wife or daughter is in danger of getting raped... you call, and get a ""ritual healer""?
If a dangerous drug addict breaks into your house and threatens your life, you call and get.... a ""conflict negotiator""?
If you get caught up in a gang fight or a drug cartel war, who will you call? Your local Antifa rep?
These people don't care about your safety. They want to protect criminals with impunity.
Image
We need to restore law and order NOW. I will work with President Trump to hunt down, prosecute, and imprison any member of Antifa who participated in domestic terrorism.
If you support our ""President of Law and Order"", as I do, I need YOUR help urgently to defeat my high-level radical socialist Democrat opponent and retake this swing seat!
Image
President Trump has accomplished so much with constant pushback from these unreasonable socialists, like these governors and mayors. Imagine what he can do with a supportive Congress!

They’re playing politics, as you know, by delaying the openings. ... To me that’s politics. They think it’s a bad thing for me if they delay the opening. I think it’s bad for them. And you have people protesting outside, and those people like Trump.”

Our hyper-partisan governor would cancel the RNC if he thought he could get away with it. That's how these tyrannical Democrat governors roll. I have never met anyone so lost in what he is doing. A lost socialist is very very dangerous because you combine incompetence with bad left wing policy at the same time.
I've had it with these people. It is now abundantly clear that their motives were NEVER to keep anyone safe or healthy. It's to accumulate power for themselves, punish those who work for a living to support their families, and tank the economy for the election.
I am disgusted and shocked by their actions. No red-blooded American should ever stand for tyranny, and no one should stand for political-fueled retributions, either.
If you are proud of our president, as I am, I need YOUR help urgently to defeat my high-level radical socialist Democrat opponent and retake this swing seat!
Let's send a message to the Socialist NC governor. Let's show these tyrants that they can't get away with this.
I am proud of those who are standing to fight with me. I have already been endorsed by Congressman Mark Walker, Congressman Ted Budd, and Congressman Mark Meadows. Here is a picture of me and Mark Meadows. Congressman Meadows used to be Chairman of the Freedom Caucus, and now he is the President Trump’s Chief of Staff in the White House. He “proudly endorsed” me shortly before his promotion, which I was so honored!
Image
President Trump has accomplished so much with constant pushback from the socialists, like these governors. Imagine what he can do with a supportive Congress!
It is so crucial that we take advantage of every chance we have to flip a swing district \- which North Carolina’s First District now is! They just redrew the map and took away a bunch of Democrat voters, making this district MUCH more competitive.
But this year, this district turned into a swing district. Half of the district has never been represented by Butterfield. They don’t know him, and they are Republicans!
Will you help me beat Butterfield and deprive Nancy Pelosi of a reliable vote? I need you to send $15, $35, or $250 right now so that I can meet my goal by the end of this month. This deadline is so critical, and I have no time to lose.
I will NEVER vote with Nancy Pelosi! She and her insane leftist agenda can pound sand!
Can you help me take this swing district back, with your best and immediate contribution of $15, $35, or $250? Taking out one of Pelosi’s leading lieutenants would be a major, crippling blow to the socialist anti-American left and to Nancy Pelosi’s agenda. Please rush back your supporting contribution today. Thank you.
G.K. Butterfield is a leftist extremist, not a patriot, but to replace him I really need your help. I appreciate you and thank you.

I am Sandy Smith, the Republican nominee for Congress in North Carolina’s newly redrawn 1st Congressional district.
I am a patriot! I was an original supporter of President Trump in 2015.
Unlike the Republican establishment, I stuck with the president - through all the media’s attempts to discredit him.
I am proud of what President Trump has done during his first term, to include his handling of this horrible Coronavirus attack on our country!
If you are proud of our president, as I am, I need YOUR help urgently to defeat my high-level radical socialist Democrat opponent and retake this swing seat!
My support of the president and my conservative platform of protecting our guns, protecting life, securing the border, and reigning in out of control spending was a major reason I won the Republican primary in March.
Conservative Trump voters in my district voted for me with a whopping 77% of the vote! I won more than 30,000 primary votes in this district - we are on fire for the President and ready to flip this seat!
There are many people coming on board with my campaign. I have already been endorsed by Congressman Mark Walker, Congressman Ted Budd, and Congressman Mark Meadows. Here is a picture of me and Mark Meadows. Congressman Meadows used to be Chairman of the Freedom Caucus, and now he is the President Trump’s Chief of Staff in the White House. He “proudly endorsed” me shortly before his promotion, which I was so honored!
Image
The Congressman whose district I was redrawn into, Democrat G.K. Butterfield, is a high-level Democrat in Nancy Pelosi’s congressional socialist army. He is one of her top lieutenants, and before that, he was a top campaigner for Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump. Taking out Butterfield will deal a massive blow to the anti-American far-left socialist agenda.
Image
I am also honored to have been endorsed by the National Association of Gun Rights and Americans for Legal Immigration PAC. They recognize me as being a staunch defender of our Second Amendment rights and opposing open borders!
With the way President Trump has masterfully handled the Russia hoax, the impeachment hoax, and now the Coronavirus, he will be reelected in a landslide. The Fake News is begging him to stop his nightly press conferences that are getting him higher approval numbers than any president in recent history.
That’s why I’m running. President Trump has accomplished so much with constant pushback from the socialists. Imagine what he can do with a supportive Congress!
First, the Never-Trumper Republican establishment - Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, the “Surrender Caucus”- fought against the President’s attempts to get government out of our Health Care.
Then, Nancy Pelosi and the revenge-driven Democrats started pushing for open borders and higher taxes, a page right out of the Communist Manifesto and implemented by the Soviet Union!
Can you believe this?!? I can’t! That’s why I’m asking for your help most urgently! Please send whatever amount you can spare to get me over the finish line.
It is so crucial that we take advantage of every chance we have to flip a swing district \- which North Carolina’s First District now is! They just redrew the map and took away a bunch of Democrat voters, making this district MUCH more competitive.

As a top anti-Trump attack dog for Pelosi and Hillary, G.K. Butterfield has been responsible for the worst assaults on our Constitution the radical activist Democrat Congress has proposed:
• G. K. Butterfield just voted for the impeachment coup of arguably one of the greatest presidents our nation has elected. He voted for impeachment, not for any crime, but for political differences.
• He supports gun confiscation, socialized medicine, and abortion on demand up until birth. He actually voted for all of these! This makes me so angry!
• Butterfield voted for open borders, allowing for the Coronavirus and other diseases and crime to flood out country. He doesn’t want a wall and wants to let criminal illegal aliens stay here indefinitely – and give them handouts, voting rights, and free college!
• He wants ICE abolished and hates our brave law enforcement officers! This is straight up anti-American!
• G.K. Butterfield votes nearly 100% of the time with Nancy Pelosi. I will vote nearly 0% of the time with Nancy Pelosi! She will be terrified when she loses her top lieutenant when he is defeated in November.
As mentioned above, G. K. Butterfield just voted for the impeachment coup of arguably one of the greatest presidents our nation has elected. Yet, read an excerpt from this explanation of why he voted to impeach President Trump. He called President Trump a domestic enemy!
“President Trump put himself before country and violated his oath of office. The oath I took is clear— I have sworn to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Based on the evidence before us, I voted in favor of both Articles of Impeachment against Donald J. Trump. No one is above the law.” – G.K. Butterfield
Why is Butterfield so radical and why does he hate President Trump so much?
Before this year, he has never had a credible challenger!
But this year, this district turned into a swing district. Half of the district has never been represented by Butterfield. They don’t know him, and they are Republicans!
With President Trump having such high favorability, and with my decisive primary win of 77%, and the fact that do-nothing Butterfield has never had a real opponent, we are going to WIN!
Will you help me beat Butterfield and deprive Nancy Pelosi of a reliable vote? I need you to send $15, $35, or $250 right now so that I can meet my goal by the end of this month. This deadline is so critical, and I have no time to lose.
You already know where I stand and that I will deliver on every important vote.... always! I won't waiver!
I will NEVER vote with Nancy Pelosi! She and her insane leftist agenda can pound sand!
We only need 18 seats to retake Congress. Can you picture what Congress would look like without Nancy Pelosi?
Think about it:
No impeachment. No tax hikes. No socialized medicine. No stifling regulations. No gun confiscations. No infanticide. No gotcha or pork-barrel addons to bills.
To me, THAT’S a future we can agree on! That’s keeping America great.
Can you help me take this swing district back, with your best and immediate contribution of $15, $35, or $250?

_______________________________________________
Dear Alex,
I am Sandy Smith, the Republican nominee for Congress in North Carolina’s newly redrawn 1st Congressional district.
As you may know, I come from a military family- including my husband and my children. My family has a legacy of service to keeping the American people safe.
Let me be clear: those who seek to riot and burn, then to blame our brave police for their violence and mistakes, CANNOT be allowed to ""defund the police""!
These riots were never ""peaceful protests"". They were grotesquely violent: over 150 killed, over 20 cops killed, hundreds of businesses and homes burned.
Image
Three black cops and several black civilians were murdered by the rioters, meaning that it was likely never about ""black lives matter"" in the first place.
Of course, it was never just protesters. Antifa, foreign actors and what Bill Barr called a ""witch's brew"" of bad actors drove the violence, arson and murder.
The federal officials gathered with Mr. Barr said they’re tracking the violence nationwide, pointing to investigations into more than 800 arsons and 76 explosive devices at protests. They described the violent actors behind them, from Antifa to the far-right Boogaloo movement.
Mr. Barr called it a “witch’s brew,” and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said different groups are involved in different cities.
Underpinning some of the dissension are the same foreign actors who have tried to meddle in American politics in the past, the officials said — though they didn’t name specific countries nor say exactly what they’ve seen.
Mr. Barr said they are “playing all sides to exacerbate the violence.”
“I believe we have evidence that some foreign hackers and groups associated with foreign governments are focused on this particular situation we have here and exacerbate it every way they can,” he said.
So, possibly Russians or Iranians or ISIS are stirring up a revolution on our streets from young extreme leftists who are murdering cops.
But actually, it's worse than that.
Antifa may be useful idiots to the Russians, but President Trump is not fooled. He is taking on that threat head on!
Image
Sensing weakness in Democrat politicians like New York's DeBlasio, or Chicago's Lightfoot, these Antifa rioters have begun to list demands.... starting with defunding- or eliminating- the police.
Already Minneapolis is disbanding the police, urged on by the odious Ilhan Omar:
Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar went beyond calls to defund the police following the death of George Floyd, instead calling for dismantling the Minneapolis Police Department because it is “rotten to the root.”
“We need to completely dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department. Because here’s the thing, there’s a cancer,” she said, continuing that amputation is needed so it doesn’t spread.
Now, anyone who was paying attention knows that these radicals have wanted to get rid of the police all along, so they wouldn't pay for the crimes they committed while rioting.
Can you imagine how things would go with no police to answer the 911 calls?
If your wife or daughter is in danger of getting raped... you call, and get a ""ritual healer""?
If a dangerous drug addict breaks into your house and threatens your life, you call and get.... a ""conflict negotiator""?
If you get caught up in a gang fight or a drug cartel war, who will you call? Your local Antifa rep?
These people don't care about your safety. They want to protect criminals with impunity.
Image
We need to restore law and order NOW. I will work with President Trump to hunt down, prosecute, and imprison any member of Antifa who participated in domestic terrorism.
If you support our ""President of Law and Order"", as I do, I need YOUR help urgently to defeat my high-level radical socialist Democrat opponent and retake this swing seat!
Image
President Trump has accomplished so much with constant pushback from these unreasonable socialists, like these governors and mayors. Imagine what he can do with a supportive Congress!
Will you help me beat anti-cop Socialist G.K. Butterfield and deprive Nancy Pelosi of a reliable vote? I have a goal of $60,000 raised this month, before the fundraising quarter ends. I need your help!
I will NEVER vote with Nancy Pelosi and her ""kneeling radicals""! She and her insane leftist agenda can pound sand!
Can you help me take this swing district back, with your best and immediate contribution of $15, $35, or $250? Taking out one of Pelosi’s leading lieutenants would be a major, crippling blow to the socialist anti-American left and to Nancy Pelosi’s agenda. Please rush back your supporting contribution today.

I am a patriot! I was an original supporter of President Trump in 2015.
Unlike the Republican establishment, I stuck with the President - through all of the media’s attempts to discredit him.
I am proud of what President Trump has done! I am a true warrior for the President and his MAGA agenda.
If you are proud of our President, as I am, I need YOUR help urgently to defeat my Democrat opponent and retake this swing seat!
My support of the President was huge in winning my primary with 77% of the vote! I won more than 30,000 votes in this district - we are on fire for the President and ready to flip this seat!
Consider what President Trump has accomplished, in three short years, despite the treachery of the Swamp and the Democrats:
-Record low unemployment.
-Record low Black and Hispanic unemployment.
-Record low female unemployment.
-Dozens of conservative judges, remaking our Federal judiciary.
-New, better trade agreements with Canada, Mexico, China, and other countries.
-Tax reforms and deregulation, paving the way for sustainable economic growth well into the future.
-Key terrorist leaders like al-Baghdadi and al-Soleimani killed!
The fact is, with 65% of Americans better off today than four years ago, President Trump has done an amazing job. And he WILL win re-election, no matter what the Swamp says!
That’s why I’m running. President Trump has accomplished all of this with constant pushback from the Swamp. Imagine what he can do with a supportive Congress!
First, the Never-Trumper Republican establishment- Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, the “Surrender Caucus”- fought against the President’s attempts to get government out of our Health Care.
Then, Nancy Pelosi and the revenge-driven Democrats started pushing for open borders and higher taxes, a page right out of the Soviet Union!
Now, AOC and Bernie Sanders are trying to bring Cuba’s or Venezuela’s “corrupt Communism” to America.
I’m old enough to remember a time when Americans fought Communism, when Ronald Reagan won the Cold War over the Soviet Union, when America was the “Land of the Free”.
Now, the corrupt Republicans are mostly gone, and the Democrats are flat-out embracing Marxism.
Can you believe this?!? I can’t! That’s why I’m asking for your help!
That’s why it is so crucial that we take advantage of every chance we have to flip a swing district\- which North Carolina’s First District now is!
The Congressman whose district I was redrawn into, Democrat G.K. Butterfield, is a general in Nancy Pelosi’s Congressional Socialist army. He is one of her deputy whips.
As one of Pelosi’s enforcers, G.K. Butterfield has been responsible for some of the worst embarrassments of the do-nothing Democrat Congress over the last two years:
-G. K. Butterfield just voted for the impeachment coup of arguably one of the greatest presidents our nation has elected. He voted for impeachment, not for any crime, but for political differences.
-He supports gun confiscation, socialized medicine, and abortion on demand up until birth. He actually voted for all of these!
-Butterfield voted for open borders. He doesn’t want a wall, and wants to let criminal illegal aliens stay here indefinitely- and let them vote!
-He wants ICE abolished and hates our brave law enforcement officers!
\- G.K. Butterfield votes nearly 100% of the time with Nancy Pelosi. I will vote nearly 0% of the time with Nancy Pelosi!
This is no future for America. This voting record does not merit re-election in a swing district.
I have a different vision for America! I will always defend our Constitution, support President Trump, and fight for the values I hold dear - God, life, family, our rights and our liberties.
I owe it to our citizens to do what is best for the country. And that means running in North Carolina's 1st Congressional District against Democrat G. K. Butterfield.
G. K. Butterfield just voted for the impeachment coup of arguably one of the greatest presidents our nation has elected. He supports gun confiscation, socialism, abortion on demand up until birth, and open borders.
Why is Butterfield so extreme? Before this year, he has never had a credible challenger!
Before the court-ordered redistricting, North Carolina’s First District was a D+36 district. It contained Durham, among other Dem strongholds.
That means that no credible Republicans ever challenged him.
It means that the local media never challenged him.
He is comfortable, and doesn’t know HOW to fight. He never had to learn!
But this year, this district turned into a D+2 district. Half of the district has never been represented by Butterfield. They don’t know him- and they are Republicans!
These are my neighbors. They won’t accept a liberal extremist like Butterfield. They are excited to come out and vote for President Trump and for me- because I will support the MAGA agenda in Congress!
Will you help me beat Butterfield and deprive Nancy Pelosi of a reliable vote?
The Dems have used the courts to cheat and choose their own voters to get rid of good Republicans the last few years. They took advantage of their new opportunities- that’s how you take Congress.
Here, we have a unique opportunity. A D+36 district got changed into a D+2 district overnight. That means it’s a swing district - and a good Republican with working class appeal can flip this district!
You already know where I stand and that I will deliver on every important vote.... always! I won't waiver!
I will NEVER vote with Nancy Pelosi! She and her insane leftist agenda can go to Hell!
I am pro-America. Democrats like AOC and Butterfield are anti-America. We will defeat them together- but only with your help!
Butterfield has half a million dollars of dirty Swamp money. But I have already raised $500,000 myself- and with your help, I will have the resources to beat him!
Pelosi takes her leftists wherever she can find them. It's time to fight back - together!
Can you help me?
I need your help urgently to make sure Butterfield doesn’t bury me early. I need the resources to define him, inform voters- and win this crucial race!
We only need 18 seats to retake Congress. Can you picture what Congress would look like without Nancy Pelosi?
Think about it:
-No impeachment.
-No tax hikes.
-No socialized medicine.
-No stifling regulations.
-No gun confiscations.
-No infanticide.
To me, THAT’S a future we can agree on! That’s keeping America great.
That’s a Congress that will produce for us, instead of embarrassing us.
We need to stop impeachment and any Congressman who voted for it. Let's save our country!
Can you help me take this swing district back, with your maximum contribution of $25, $50, $100, $250, $500, $1000, or even $2800 per individual, $5600 per couple?
Can you show your support of our Constitution and our President, with the largest contribution you can make? Anything you can give is much appreciated!
I know there’s a lot of needs. Because of Pelosi’s extremism, there’s a lot of seats we can flip.
But taking out one of Pelosi’s leading generals would be a major, crippling blow to the American Left.
Without Butterfield, Pelosi will be without a right hand.
We can strike a crucial blow to the Dems by taking this seat back. Pelosi will never recover- which is OK by me!
Your contribution will make a BIG difference here. Let’s go beat the Democrats together- with YOUR help!

That’s why I’m running. President Trump has accomplished all of this with constant pushback from the Swamp. Imagine what he can do with a supportive Congress!
First, the Never-Trumper Republican establishment - Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, the “Surrender Caucus”- fought against the President’s attempts to get government out of our Health Care.
Then, Nancy Pelosi and the revenge-driven Democrats started pushing for open borders and higher taxes, a page right out of the Soviet Union!
Now, AOC and Bernie Sanders are trying to bring Cuba’s or Venezuela’s “corrupt Communism” to America.
I’m old enough to remember a time when Americans fought Communism, when Ronald Reagan won the Cold War over the Soviet Union, when America was the “Land of the Free”.
Now, the corrupt Republicans are mostly gone, and the Democrats are flat-out embracing Marxism.
Can you believe this?!? I can’t! That’s why I’m asking for your help most urgently!
That’s why it is so crucial that we take advantage of every chance we have to flip a swing district- which North Carolina’s First District now is!
The Congressman whose district I was redrawn into, Democrat G.K. Butterfield, is a general in Nancy Pelosi’s Congressional Socialist army. He is one of her deputy whips.
As one of Pelosi’s enforcers, G.K. Butterfield has been responsible for some of the worst embarrassments of the do-nothing Democrat Congress over the last two years:
-G. K. Butterfield just voted for the impeachment coup of arguably one of the greatest presidents our nation has elected. He voted for impeachment, not for any crime, but for political differences.
-He supports gun confiscation, socialized medicine, and abortion on demand up until birth. He actually voted for all of these!
-Butterfield voted for open borders. He doesn’t want a wall, and wants to let criminal illegal aliens stay here indefinitely- and let them vote!
-He wants ICE abolished and hates our brave law enforcement officers!
-G.K. Butterfield votes nearly 100% of the time with Nancy Pelosi. I will vote nearly 0% of the time with Nancy Pelosi!
This is no future for America. This voting record does not merit re-election in a swing district.
I have a different vision for America! I will always defend our Constitution, support President Trump, and fight for the values I hold dear - God, life, family, our rights and our liberties.
I owe it to our citizens to do what is best for the country. And that means running in North Carolina's 1st Congressional District against Democrat G. K. Butterfield.
G. K. Butterfield just voted for the impeachment coup of arguably one of the greatest presidents our nation has elected. He supports gun confiscation, socialism, abortion on demand up until birth, and open borders.
Why is Butterfield so extreme? Before this year, he has never had a credible challenger!
Before the court-ordered redistricting, North Carolina’s First District was a D+36 district. It contained Durham, among other Dem strongholds.
That means that no credible Republicans ever challenged him.
It means that the local media never challenged him.
He is fat and happy, and doesn’t know HOW to fight. He never had to learn!
But this year, this district turned into a D+2 district. Half of the district has never been represented by Butterfield. They don’t know him- and they are Republicans!
These are my neighbors. They won’t accept a liberal extremist like Butterfield. They are excited to come out and vote for President Trump and for me- because I will support the MAGA agenda in Congress!
Will you help me beat Butterfield and deprive Nancy Pelosi of a reliable vote?
The Dems have used the courts to cheat and choose their own voters to get rid of good Republicans the last few years. They took advantage of their new opportunities- that’s how you take Congress.
Here, we have a unique opportunity. A D+36 district got changed into a D+2 district overnight. That means it’s a swing district- and a good Republican with working class appeal can flip this district!
You already know where I stand and that I will deliver on every important vote.... always! I won't waiver!
I am pro-America. Democrats like AOC and Butterfield are anti-America. We will defeat them together- but only with your help!
Butterfield has half a million dollars of dirty Swamp money. But I have already raised $500,000 myself- and with your help, I will have the resources to beat him!
Pelosi takes her leftists wherever she can find them. It's time to fight back - together!
Can you help me?
I need your help urgently to make sure Butterfield doesn’t bury me early. I need the resources to define him, inform voters- and win this crucial race!
We only need 18 seats to retake Congress. Can you picture what Congress would look like without Nancy Pelosi?
Think about it:
-No impeachment.
-No tax hikes.
-No socialized medicine.
-No stifling regulations.
-No gun confiscations.
-No infanticide.
To me, THAT’S a future we can agree on! That’s keeping America great.
That’s a Congress that will produce for us, instead of embarrassing us.
We need to stop impeachment and any Congressman who voted for it. Let's save our country!
Can you show your support of our Constitution and our President, with the largest contribution you can make? Anything you can give is much appreciated!
I know there’s a lot of needs. Because of Pelosi’s extremism, there’s a lot of seats we can flip.
But taking out one of Pelosi’s leading generals would be a major, crippling blow to the American Left.
Without Butterfield, Pelosi will be without a right hand.
We can strike a crucial blow to the Dems by taking this seat back. Pelosi will never recover- which is OK by me!
I have a big fundraising deadline at the end of this month, I must raise $50,000 to keep pace with my radical Dem opponent.
Can you help me take this swing district back, with your maximum contribution of $25, $50, $100, $250, $500, $1000, or even $2800 per individual, $5600 per couple?
Your contribution will make a BIG difference here. Let’s go beat the Democrats together- with YOUR help!

When a politician gets rich off of the public, and tries to take away our guns and police while having protection for himself.... it's time to go!
I am Sandy Smith, the Republican nominee for North Carolina's crucial First District, fighting to expose the Swamp Monster G.K. Butterfield!
This guy is absolutely awful. He wants to take away our gun rights. He wants to defund police.
But that means that we we are left defenseless in one of the highest crime districts in America.... because of him.
Having him as a Congressman is awful. He positively hates our district, never comes back here and never lifts a finger for us.
The only time we hear from him is when he's shilling for radical ""social justice"" groups- trying to defund police or make abortion legal even after birth!
This guy is just too radical for us.
Image
I am not a radical Leftist like G.K. Butterfield. I am a business owner, a military mom, and have supported President Trump from Day One!
We don't need San Francisco politics here in North Carolina! Can you help me send Pelosi a message?
This guy's record is horrible. He's Pelosi's stooge, voting with her 99% of the time. He votes with the far, far, far Left.... not with us!
Image
This guy is a bad Congressman and a direct threat to our rights. He HAS to go!
The whole election may turn on North Carolina. The President needs it, we have a key Senate race here, and my race is critical for retaking the House!
I'm in a VERY close race with one of Pelosi's clones, G.K. Butterfield. We have raised over $1 million and can win!! Your support could be the thing that gets us over the top here!
If you want President Trump to win next month, we need to stand together right now! The Left is going all-out; we patriots need to also!
Can you help me win this swing district in this swing state, with your urgent contribution of $25, $50, $100, $250, $500, $1000 or more? It's not the time to complain or fatigue... it's the time to win, and win now!
G.K. Butterfield's record is awful, but to replace him I really need you today! Let's stand up to these hypocrites now, before it's too late!

901,"Dear Alex,
I am Sandy Smith, the Republican nominee for Congress in North Carolina’s newly redrawn 1st Congressional district.
I am a patriot! I was an original supporter of President Trump in 2015.
Unlike the Republican establishment, I stuck with the president - through all the media’s attempts to discredit him.
I am proud of what President Trump has done during his first term, to include his handling of this horrible Coronavirus attack on our country!
If you are proud of our president, as I am, I need YOUR help urgently to defeat my high-level radical socialist Democrat opponent and retake this swing seat!
My support of the president and my conservative platform of protecting our guns, protecting life, securing the border, and reigning in out of control spending was a major reason I won the Republican primary in March.
Conservative Trump voters in my district voted for me with a whopping 77% of the vote! I won more than 30,000 primary votes in this district - we are on fire for the President and ready to flip this seat!
There are many people coming on board with my campaign. I have already been endorsed by Congressman Mark Walker, Congressman Ted Budd, and Congressman Mark Meadows. Here is a picture of me and Mark Meadows. Congressman Meadows used to be Chairman of the Freedom Caucus, and now he is the President Trump’s Chief of Staff in the White House. He “proudly endorsed” me shortly before his promotion, which I was so honored!
Image
The Congressman whose district I was redrawn into, Democrat G.K. Butterfield, is a high-level Democrat in Nancy Pelosi’s congressional socialist army. He is one of her top lieutenants, and before that, he was a top campaigner for Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump. Taking out Butterfield will deal a massive blow to the anti-American far-left socialist agenda.
Image
I am also honored to have been endorsed by the National Association of Gun Rights and Americans for Legal Immigration PAC. They recognize me as being a staunch defender of our Second Amendment rights and opposing open borders!
With the way President Trump has masterfully handled the Russia hoax, the impeachment hoax, and now the Coronavirus, he will be reelected in a landslide. The Fake News is begging him to stop his nightly press conferences that are getting him higher approval numbers than any president in recent history.
That’s why I’m running. President Trump has accomplished so much with constant pushback from the socialists. Imagine what he can do with a supportive Congress!
First, the Never-Trumper Republican establishment - Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, the “Surrender Caucus”- fought against the President’s attempts to get government out of our Health Care.
Then, Nancy Pelosi and the revenge-driven Democrats started pushing for open borders and higher taxes, a page right out of the Communist Manifesto and implemented by the Soviet Union!
Can you believe this?!? I can’t! That’s why I’m asking for your help most urgently! Please send whatever amount you can spare to get me over the finish line.
It is so crucial that we take advantage of every chance we have to flip a swing district \- which North Carolina’s First District now is! They just redrew the map and took away a bunch of Democrat voters, making this district MUCH more competitive.
Image
As a top anti-Trump attack dog for Pelosi and Hillary, G.K. Butterfield has been responsible for the worst assaults on our Constitution the radical activist Democrat Congress has proposed:
• G. K. Butterfield just voted for the impeachment coup of arguably one of the greatest presidents our nation has elected. He voted for impeachment, not for any crime, but for political differences.
• He supports gun confiscation, socialized medicine, and abortion on demand up until birth. He actually voted for all of these! This makes me so angry!
• Butterfield voted for open borders, allowing for the Coronavirus and other diseases and crime to flood out country. He doesn’t want a wall and wants to let criminal illegal aliens stay here indefinitely – and give them handouts, voting rights, and free college!
• He wants ICE abolished and hates our brave law enforcement officers! This is straight up anti-American!
• G.K. Butterfield votes nearly 100% of the time with Nancy Pelosi. I will vote nearly 0% of the time with Nancy Pelosi! She will be terrified when she loses her top lieutenant when he is defeated in November.
As mentioned above, G. K. Butterfield just voted for the impeachment coup of arguably one of the greatest presidents our nation has elected. Yet, read an excerpt from this explanation of why he voted to impeach President Trump. He called President Trump a domestic enemy!
“President Trump put himself before country and violated his oath of office. The oath I took is clear— I have sworn to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Based on the evidence before us, I voted in favor of both Articles of Impeachment against Donald J. Trump. No one is above the law.” – G.K. Butterfield
Why is Butterfield so radical and why does he hate President Trump so much?
Before this year, he has never had a credible challenger!
But this year, this district turned into a swing district. Half of the district has never been represented by Butterfield. They don’t know him, and they are Republicans!
With President Trump having such high favorability, and with my decisive primary win of 77%, and the fact that do-nothing Butterfield has never had a real opponent, we are going to WIN!
Will you help me beat Butterfield and deprive Nancy Pelosi of a reliable vote? I need you to send $15, $35, or $250 right now so that I can meet my goal by the end of this month. This deadline is so critical, and I have no time to lose.
You already know where I stand and that I will deliver on every important vote.... always! I won't waiver!
I will NEVER vote with Nancy Pelosi! She and her insane leftist agenda can pound sand!
We only need 18 seats to retake Congress. Can you picture what Congress would look like without Nancy Pelosi?
Think about it:
No impeachment. No tax hikes. No socialized medicine. No stifling regulations. No gun confiscations. No infanticide. No gotcha or pork-barrel addons to bills.
To me, THAT’S a future we can agree on! That’s keeping America great.
Can you help me take this swing district back, with your best and immediate contribution of $15, $35, or $250? Taking out one of Pelosi’s leading lieutenants would be a major, crippling blow to the socialist anti-American left and to Nancy Pelosi’s agenda. Please rush back your supporting contribution today. Thank you.
G.K. Butterfield is a leftist extremist, not a patriot, but to replace him I really need your help. I appreciate you and thank you.

I am a patriot! I was an original supporter of President Trump in 2015.

Consider what President Trump has accomplished, in three short years, despite the treachery of the Swamp and the Democrats:
-Record low unemployment.
-Record low Black and Hispanic unemployment.
-Record low female unemployment.
-Dozens of conservative judges, remaking our Federal judiciary.
-New, better trade agreements with Canada, Mexico, China, and other countries.
-Tax reforms and deregulation, paving the way for sustainable economic growth well into the future.
-Key terrorist leaders like al-Baghdadi and al-Soleimani killed!

WHILE KELLY LOEFFLER STANDS FOR LAW AND ORDER, DOUG COLLINS IS WEAK ON CRIME AND IMMIGRATION
ATLANTA – Doug Collins claims to be ""conservative,"" but his record says otherwise. For years, he has voted with liberal Democrats like Stacey Abrams and Nancy Pelosi to advance a radical, left-wing agenda.
In the State House, Collins teamed up with liberal Stacey Abrams to undermine the 2nd Amendment, raise taxes on hardworking Georgians, and reduce prison time for violent criminals.
In between stints as a politician, Doug worked as a criminal defense attorney, specifically marketing his services to people accused of the most heinous crimes, including murder, rape and child cruelty. Doug explicitly solicited violent criminals, promising to ""shoulder [their] burden"" by pushing for lighter sentences. Some defendants returned to the streets to commit worse crimes.
In Congress, D.C. Doug repeatedly voted to approve and fund dangerous left-wing policies, including Obama's amnesty and sanctuary cities.
Meanwhile, Kelly Loeffler has been a champion for law and order. She has voted with President Trump 100 percent of the time to strengthen our borders, support our law enforcement and crack down on rioters, looters and left-wing mobs. Senator Loeffler has introduced legislation to:
* Create a national gang database
* Speed up the deportation process for gang members in our country illegally
* Increase criminal penalties for gang members
* Defund jurisdictions that defund their police
* Make looting small businesses a federal crime
* Cut funds to jurisdictions that refuse to prosecute looters
* Allow concealed carry for prosecutors and federal judges
* Allow judges to issue arrest warrants for illegal immigrants who miss court hearings
* Facilitate holding accused rioters for trial by refusing catch-and-release policies
* Bar federally convicted rioters from receiving virus-related unemployment benefits
* Create a federal, private and civil cause of action for victims of rioters to seek damages
“No matter how hard Doug Collins tries to hide it, he’s got a well-documented history of siding with liberals like Stacey Abrams and Nancy Pelosi to weaken our laws and endanger our citizens,” said Communications Director Stephen Lawson. “Whether as a trial lawyer who worked to put violent offenders back on the street, or as a politician who voted to fund sanctuary cities and reduce criminal penalties, Doug Collins has always put criminals ahead of the safety of Georgia families. There is only one candidate in this race who has stood with President Trump 100 percent of the time to crack down on crime and support our law enforcement – and that’s conservative Kelly Loeffler.”
BACKGROUND
In 2014, Collins voted for a $1.1 trillion omnibus that funded President Obama’s Executive Orders granting amnesty to illegal immigrants. (Roll Call Vote #563, 12/11/14) (""Vote Alert: House: $1.1T Bill That Funds Executive Amnesty,"" Conservative Review, 9/17/14; ""NumbersUSA to grade CRomnibus vote as a vote for Amnesty,"" NumbersUSA, 12/9/14)
In 2008, Collins Sponsored HB 1298 With Stacey Abrams – A Bill To Make It Easier For Violent Criminal Defendants To Claim Mental Insanity And Thereby Avoid The Death Penalty Or A Life Sentence Without Parole In Murder Cases (H.B. 1298, Georgia General Assembly, Introduced 2/21/08)
Collins & Csider’s Website Marketed Its Services To Defendants Accused Of Felonies And Misdemeanors (Collins & Csider, Archived 8/12/15)
In July 2009, Collins Defended Danny Clore On Charges Of Methamphetamine Distribution And Misdemeanor Possession Of Marijuana. The Meth Distribution Charge Was Dismissed While The Marijuana Charge Was Conditionally Discharged. (Case No. 2009CR000723, Hall County Superior Court, Filed 7/17/09)
Clore Went On To Commit More Crimes, Including Aggravated Assault, Illegal Possession Of A Firearm, And Obstructing A Police Officer. (Hall County Courts, Accessed 2/5/20)
Clore Led Police On A High-Speed Chase In 2015 After Shooting At Two Vehicles With Occupants Inside Them; Meth Was Found On His Person When He Was Arrested. “A Gainesville man wanted in Hall County in connection with a shooting was arrested Saturday after dogs and deputies tracked him through the woods of Rabun County. ‘We continued tracking (Danny Ray Clore) and later located a camo (waterproof) box that contained drugs and other .380 magazines,’ according to the report. ‘Minutes later (Clore) was located hiding behind a large log on the ground…’ Deputies responded to that incident around 1:30 p.m. to reports of someone ‘firing rounds from an automatic weapon,’ Hall County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Deputy Nicole Bailes said. ‘Clore shot at two vehicles that each had two occupants inside the vehicles at the time of the incident,’ Bailes wrote in an email… Officers chased Clore, who reportedly was ‘weaving in and out and traveling at a high rate of speed...’ ‘(The officer) then searched in the leaves where (Clore) was laying and located a Ruger .380 pistol and a Ziploc bag containing what appeared to (be) methamphetamine,’ according to the report. He was charged with possession of methamphetamine, fleeing and eluding by the Rabun County Sheriff’s Office.” (Nick Watson, “Authorities: Gainesville Shooting Suspect Captured After Chase Through Woods,” Gainesville Times, 11/23/15)
In June 2008, Collins Defended Shacara Rucker On Charges Of Armed Robbery, Criminal Conspiracy, Two Kidnappings, Four Aggravated Assaults, Theft, And Possessing A Firearm For Use In A Crime. Rucker and accomplices Scroger and Cook Were Found Guilty Of Criminal Conspiracy And Two Kidnappings, Though The Kidnappings Were Amended To Lighter Charges. The Armed Robbery, Aggravated Assault, And Theft Charges Against Rucker, Scroger, And Cook Were Dismissed. (Case No. 2009CR000650, Hall County Superior Court, Filed 6/30/08)
The Defendants Reportedly Robbed A McDonald’s Restaurant At Gunpoint, Forcing Employees Into A Walk-In Cooler. “Five people have been arrested in connection with the early morning armed robbery of a Flowery Branch McDonald’s restaurant, including an employee whom investigators believe was involved. Hall County Sheriff’s Col. Jeff Strickland said two females and two males were let into the restaurant at 3 a.m. Friday by an employee, supposedly to use the bathroom. One of the four suspects pulled out a small caliber handgun and forced two of the restaurant’s three employees into a walk-in cooler. The third employee opened the safe for the robbers and handed over an undisclosed amount of cash, Strickland said. No one was injured and the cooler was not locked…After questioning the employees, investigators determined that one of the McDonald’s workers, 24-year-old Jeremy Scroger, assisted in the robbery, Strickland said. After securing a search warrant, investigators recovered the handgun and the stolen money from the Mazda, Strickland said. Scroger was charged with armed robbery and kidnapping. Also charged with armed robbery and kidnapping were Sidney Lewis Howell, 17, Shinard Ryaston Cook, 18, Siedah Yasmeen Smith, 21, and Shacarra Rucker, 18.” (Stephen Gurr, “Five Are Arrested In McDonalds Robbery,” Gainesville Times, 5/29/09)

KAMALA HARRIS AND DOUG COLLINS WEAK ON CRIME, PRIORITIZED VIOLENT CRIMINALS OVER THE SAFETY OF AMERICAN FAMILIES
ATLANTA -- The Georgians for Kelly Loeffler campaign issued the following statement following the news that Kamala Harris recently helped free defendants who have been charged with murder, violent felonies, and sex crimes, just like Doug Collins did in his work as a criminal defense attorney.
“Just like Kamala Harris, Doug Collins earned a paycheck by putting the interests of criminals before the safety of law-abiding Americans. As a criminal defense attorney, Doug Collins marketed directly to some of Georgia's most heinous offenders – fighting to keep drug dealers, domestic abusers, kidnappers and robbers out of prison. Thanks to the efforts of career politicians like Kamala Harris and Doug Collins, violent criminals are back on the streets and continue terrorizing communities in Georgia and across the country,” said Communications Director Stephen Lawson.
“Unlike Doug Collins, Kelly Loeffler believes that violent criminals belong in jail. Georgians deserve a law and order candidate like Kelly Loeffler who will stand with our men and women in law enforcement to protect Georgia families--not a career politician and criminal defense attorney like Doug Collins who cares more about his own pocketbook than Georgians' public safety.”

GEORGIA SHERIFFS DENOUNCE DOUG COLLINS' CRIMINAL DEFENSE HISTORY
ATLANTA – Today, Georgia sheriffs issued a joint statement disavowing career politician Doug Collins' disastrous record of siding with violent criminals and endorsing Kelly Loeffler as the only law and order candidate in the race for her United States Senate seat:
“Kelly Loeffler has proven that she will stand with our law enforcement community to protect Georgia families and communities.
""Doug Collins has made a career out of putting the interests of criminals before the safety of Georgia’s families. In the Georgia legislature, he teamed up with Stacey Abrams to reduce prison sentences for violent offenders. As a criminal defense attorney, Collins defended drug dealers and domestic abusers, some of whom went on to commit even worse crimes.
""Georgia needs a leader who will always stand up for law and order-- not violent criminals – which is why we’re proud to endorse Kelly Loeffler for United States Senate.""
Sheriff Jud Smith, Barrow County
Sheriff Clark Millsap, Bartow County
Sheriff Jim Proctor, Camden County
Sheriff Gary Sisk, Catoosa County
Sheriff Neal Jump, Glynn County
Sheriff Butch Conway, Gwinnett County
Sheriff Mike Jolley, Harris County
Sheriff Robert Oglesby, Jenkins County
Sheriff Joe Chapman, Walton County
Not only does Senator Loeffler have the endorsement of over a dozen sheriffs and district attorneys across Georgia, she also has a strong legislative record of supporting law enforcement. Last week, she introduced legislation to crack down on criminal gang activity, strengthen criminal gang sentencing guidelines, and deport illegal gang members. She has also introduced legislation to withhold federal funding from jurisdictions that attempt to defund their police departments.
Doug Collins, meanwhile, has a well-documented history of siding with criminals instead of holding them accountable. In the Georgia legislature, he teamed up with Stacey Abrams to reduce prison time for violent criminals. As a criminal defense attorney, he helped reduce and eliminate sentences for murderers, rapists, and child abusers - putting them back on the streets and jeopardizing the safety of our families and public safety officers alike.

EXPOSED: DOUG COLLINS' LIBERAL VOTING RECORD
ATLANTA – Actions always speak louder than words, and while career politician Doug Collins claims to be a ""conservative,"" his extensive liberal voting record says otherwise. Georgians need to be aware of the truth about D.C. Doug Collins:
* Received an ""F"" rating from Conservative Review.
* Ranked second-most liberal Georgia Republican in the House.
* Ranked more liberal than 87% of Congressional Republicans.
* Ranked the 173rd most conservative member of Congress –– He even has a more liberal voting record than multiple House Democrats.
* Voted with Nancy Pelosi over 800 times.
* Voted with Stacey Abrams over 300 times.
* Voted for every single one of Barack Obama's big-spending budgets.
* Voted to fund amnesty, sanctuary cities and Common Core.
* Worked with radical liberal Stacey Abrams to undermine 2nd-Amendment Rights in Georgia and put violent criminals back on the streets.
* Received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Big Tech companies and then protected them from investigation in Congress.
""For 15 years, Doug Collins has sold out Georgia conservatives. He's ranked one of the most liberal Congressional Republicans, voted with Nancy Pelosi over 800 times, partnered with Stacey Abrams over 300 times, and even received an 'F' rating from Conservative Review,"" said Kelly Loeffler. ""Georgians deserve a true conservative champion and a political outsider who won't pay lip service to hardworking Georgians and their families. As the most conservative U.S. Senator in America who is endorsed by National Right to Life and has a 100-percent Trump voting record, I am the only candidate in this race with a proven record of results. No matter what, I will always stand up and fight for our conservative values.""
While fake conservative Doug Collins says one thing and does another, Kelly Loeffler has been hard at work to advance President Trump's conservative agenda. Notably, Kelly Loeffler has a 100-percent Trump voting record, and she was recently ranked the most conservative senator in America. She will always protect innocent life, stand up for the 2nd Amendment, crack down on crime and illegal immigration and fight the far-left extremists who want to take over America.

908,"Friend,
Kelly stood strong for law-and-order this week - taking several major actions to support our police officers, crack down on criminals, and bring peace back to our streets.
In major news, Kelly was the first candidate in her race to call for convicted cop killers to be sentenced to death for their crimes. Her strong stand comes just days after two sheriff's deputies – who are still recovering in the hospital – were brutally ambushed by a masked gunman in Los Angeles. As Kelly said:
""For months, the radical left’s defund the police movement has promoted violence, chaos and anarchy in cities across our country, while villainizing and attacking the brave men and women in law enforcement who risk their lives to keep us safe. Now these dangerous leftists have started putting words into violent action — targeting and brutally attacking law enforcement. That’s why today I am calling for convicted cop killers in America to be sentenced to death.""
In fact, Kelly even blasted Kamala Harris this week for her failure to denounce the ""disgusting"" display of hatred toward the injured deputies by protesters outside the hospital. She slammed Kamala for promoting a bail fund to free violent criminals - including those who are targeting our police officers on the streets. And later in the week, Kelly took action - joining her colleagues to introduce the ""Serve and Protect Act,"" which would slap offenders like the Compton gunman with a 10 years-to-life sentence for targeting law enforcement officers for assault or murder.
In addition to being recognized for her law-and-order values this week, Kelly also won praise for her pro-life positions - receiving an ""A"" rating from the Susan B. Anthony List, which has already strongly endorsed her campaign. Kelly is 100% pro-life - and will always fight against the abortion-on-demand agenda of the Left.
On top of that, Kelly took a few more principled stands this week - slamming Disney for its cozy relationship with China, and pushing back hard against Netflix's new Cuties movie for its exploitation of young children. She has led on this issue, calling for a hearing on preventing human and child trafficking.
Finally, Kelly joined President Trump at the White House for the signing of the Abraham Accords, which marked the historic normalization of relations in the Middle East. As Kelly said on the Guy Benson show this week:
""This is the fulfillment of promises made and kept by President Trump from day one. Truly historic to see the leaders from UAE and Bahrain on the stage with Netanyahu and President Trump. Truly historic and important. I mean, this is a fulfillment of the president's promise of ongoing building peace through strength ... He's delivered at every step along the way, whether it's dealing with North Korea or Iran and now bringing peace to the Middle East in this very historic and certainly Nobel-peace worthy agreement.""
Speaking of promises kept, Kelly announced this week that Accura Engineering, a Georgia-owned business, has been awarded a government contract to play a key role in constructing the border wall. Kelly is a strong proponent of President Trump's wall, and she is thrilled to see a Georgia business contribute so much to this effort.
While Kelly fights for conservative Georgia values, the same can't be said for her opponents. Doug Collins is a weak-on-crime career politician who has teamed up with radical liberal Stacey Abrams to undercut the 2nd Amendment, raise taxes on hardworking Georgians, and reduce prison time for violent criminals. Instead of fighting for Georgians, Doug spent years embracing Abrams and building close friendships with unhinged liberals like impeachment manager Hakeem Jeffries, who called Donald Trump the ""grand wizard of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.""

It was a big week for the campaign! With Kelly surging in the polls and with Georgians across the state coalescing behind her strong conservative message and record of results, it's clear that Team Kelly has the momentum on our side.
The latest poll of our race, released this week, shows Kelly with a commanding lead over Doug Collins. According to the poll, Kelly is leading Collins 26% - 20%. Even better: she's beating him by 7% among Trump voters and 11% among Republican voters.
﻿Clearly, Georgia's conservatives agree: it's time to stop electing career politicians who don't get things done – or worse, who have a long history of siding with liberals and special interests groups. To learn more about why Georgia's conservatives are ditching D.C. Doug, click HERE.
In fact, even Georgia's sheriffs are speaking out about Doug's shameful past – this week issuing a statement denouncing his record of siding with violent criminals, partnering with soft-on-crime liberals, and jeopardizing the safety of Georgia families:
""Doug Collins has made a career out of putting the interests of criminals before the safety of Georgia’s families. In the Georgia legislature, he teamed up with Stacey Abrams to reduce prison sentences for violent offenders. As a criminal defense attorney, Collins defended drug dealers and domestic abusers, some of whom went on to commit even worse crimes.
""Georgia needs a leader who will always stand up for law and order– not violent criminals – which is why we’re proud to endorse Kelly Loeffler for United States Senate.""
Kelly, meanwhile, continues to stand up for our law enforcement officers and the security of all Americans – vocally supporting President Trump's efforts to restore law and order to Democrat-run cities, and introducing her own legislation to crack down on gang crime and deport criminal illegals. She even spoke to the Georgia Sheriff's Association this week – highlighting her promise to defund any cities that try to defund the police.
In fact, Kelly talked extensively this week with Breitbart and One America News about her strong support for our police officers – and her strong opposition to groups like the BLM political organization that are trying to defund them. You can listen to her full Breitbart interview HERE, and click the photo below to watch her discussion with One America News:
Kelly also hosted Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma on Monday at a roundtable event with Georgia healthcare leaders to discuss ways to combat the coronavirus in Georgia. This roundtable event builds on Kelly's work to support Georgia healthcare during the COVID-19 crisis, including her push for expanded telehealth services, her efforts to secure greater federal funding for rural hospitals, and her work to expand access to rural healthcare generally.

Kelly took another strong stand this week - refusing to be silenced by cancel culture, and fighting to give conservatives a voice in the era of the woke mob.
As you may have seen, the WNBA staged a stunt on Wednesday in response to Kelly's opposition to the radical Black Lives Matter political organization - which the league embraced. To no surprise, it turns out that failed gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams was behind the ploy.
Kelly appeared on The Ingraham Angle to respond to WNBA players’ recent choice to wear t-shirts endorsing her Democrat opponent, Raphael Warnock. As Kelly said:
“This isn’t about playing basketball, it’s about playing politics … But I stood up for our American flag, suggested that we replace the divisive idea of this political organization Black Lives Matter … I had to draw the line, and I had to speak out....I think we all know the power that sports has to bring people together … and that’s been totally eradicated here in this moment where, because I have a conservative voice, they want me out, they want to cancel [[URL REDACTED]] is emblematic of what’s happening across the country … I’m standing up because I have a platform for Americans that feel like they can’t have a voice.""
Click HERE or on the photo below to watch the full interview.
While Kelly has been fighting nonstop for conservative values, the same can't be said for career politician Doug Collins.
He claims to be a conservative, yet in the State House, Doug teamed up with his ""good friend"" Stacey Abrams to vote for the ""largest tax increase"" in Georgia history. He also voted for higher taxes on cars, guns, farmers and even marriage.
Georgians deserve a conservative businessperson like Kelly Loeffler who knows how to balance a budget and create jobs – not another phony politician like Doug Collins who taxes everything, spends recklessly, and views taxpayers as a piggybank for his paycheck. Click below to see our newest ad, exposing phony Doug's cringeworthy record of supporting tax hikes on Georgia's families:
Because of her strong efforts to protect conservative speech and stand up for our values, support for Kelly is growing at an astronomical rate, as we announced this week. Since March, our campaign has:
* Hired over 30 field staff and interns
* Launched a Satellite Office in Athens dedicated to voter outreach
* Made over 600,000 phone calls to voters
* Sent over 400,000 texts to voters
* Handwritten and sent over 5,000 postcards to voters
* Placed over 5,000 yard signs around the state
* Met with over 1,000 Georgians on her recess tour
* Established grassroots leadership teams in all 159 counties
* Secured endorsements from 100+ state and local officials
With clear advantages in resources, infrastructure, and grassroots support, Team Kelly is clearly building toward a big win in November!
Meanwhile, back in Washington, Kelly has been fighting to restore law and order in America's cities, and crack down on crime and looting. This week, Kelly introduced several pieces of legislation, including a bill to legalize concealed carry for prosecutors and federal judges, a bill that would allow judges to issue arrest warrants for illegal immigrants who miss court hearings, and a bill that would cut aid to jurisdictions that do not prosecute looters.

This week, Kelly joined President Trump in taking a strong stand against the senseless violence and lawlessness occurring in Atlanta and other Democrat-run cities cross America.
Kelly's major push for law and order comes on the heels of her wildly successful All About Georgia Recess Tour, where she spent two weeks rallying with hardworking Georgians at dozens of meet-and-greets across the state. With hundreds of energized conservatives at each event, Kelly is the only candidate in her race to plan and complete a successful statewide tour. She is also the only candidate with grassroots organization in all 159 counties, and boasts a strong lead in local and state endorsements.
On Tuesday, Kelly introduced legislation to crack down on gang activity. Kelly's plan would make it easier to put gang members behind bars by increasing sentences for gang-related crimes and creating a nationwide database to track gang activity. It also increases the likelihood of deporting a gang member who is in the country illegally. Governor Brian Kemp, Attorney General Chris Carr and Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vic Reynolds have all endorsed Kelly's plan.
On Wednesday, Kelly joined Charles Payne on Fox News to discuss her plan, and to stand with President Trump as he fights to restore law and order in Democrat-run cities across America. As Kelly said:
“[My bill] is aimed at exactly what the President was just talking about. Our first duty is to keep Americans safe and secure, to protect families across our communities. This anti-gang statute that I’m introducing at the federal level helps update outdated federal gang statutes – making it easier to prosecute gang members and to deport illegal immigrants who conduct crime in organized gangs…we need to stop this senseless violence…we have to draw the line right now....
“[Democrat mayors] are allowing chaos to happen in their cities. Where’s the outrage for eight-year-old Secoriea Turner, who was gunned down in the streets of Atlanta? Operation Legend, honoring LeGend Taliferro, is so important to make people realize that we’re helping defend the communities that [these elected officials] are not helping.""

From fighting against the 'defund the police' movement, to sponsoring legislation to deport criminal illegal aliens, Kelly has a rock solid record of standing with law enforcement against criminal activity and gang violence. Unfortunately for the safety of Georgia's families, Doug Collins does not.
Before he was a career politician, Doug made big bucks as a criminal defense attorney. Doug and his partner, Tom Csider, worked diligently to get criminal charges reduced or dropped for violent criminals - specifically marketing their firm's services to murderers, rapists, child abusers and other heinous offenders. After they successfully got these criminals off the hook, many of their defendants went on to commit more crimes in communities across Georgia. Once again, Doug Collins has proven that he only plays a conservative on TV.

NEW AD EXPOSES DOUG COLLINS' DANGEROUS RECORD OF DEFENDING CRIMINALS
ATLANTA — Today, the Georgians for Kelly Loeffler campaign released a new ad exposing Doug Collins and his dangerous record of defending violent offenders in Georgia.
""As a criminal defense attorney, Doug Collins was putting his paycheck above the safety of Georgia families,” said Press Secretary Caitlin O'Dea. ""For years, his firm represented gang members, domestic abusers, and rapists. Collins and his law partner, Tom Csider, fought to keep these vile criminals in our communities and out of prison.
""Now, Doug Collins is a career politician who pretends to be a rock-solid, law and order conservative. He talks a good game on TV, but his dangerous record tells another story.
“Kelly Loeffler is a conservative businesswoman and political outsider who has fought in the U.S. Senate to protect funding for law enforcement. She’s tough on crime, proudly backs the blue, and wants violent criminals behind bars - where they belong.
“There's only one law and order candidate in this race - and that's obviously Kelly Loeffler.""

914,"Friend,
Kelly had another strong week, building tremendous momentum and closing out her All About Georgia Recess Tour by visiting with hundreds of Georgians from all over the state. On Monday, Kelly was joined by Governor Brian Kemp and Georgia First Lady Marty Kemp in Savannah, and then she finished the day in Dalton. On Tuesday, Kelly rolled out an all-star line-up of statewide elected officials to stump for her in Muscogee, Carroll and Fayette Counties.
Click the photo below to see a video message from Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, Attorney General Chris Carr, Insurance Commissioner John King and Public Service Commissioner Tim Echols encouraging voters to join them in supporting Kelly:
On Wednesday, Kelly was again joined by Governor Kemp, this time in Peachtree Corners, for a HUGE rally with a great group of supporters. On Thursday, U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) joined Kelly for her campaign stops in Gilmer, Forsyth and Hall Counties, explaining why Kelly is the tough-on-crime, tough-on-China, no-nonsense conservative Georgia needs in Washington.
In case you missed it, the Radical Left crashed Kelly's event in Forsyth County, opting for screaming and yelling instead of productive dialogue and a helpful exchange of ideas. This display perfectly explains the Left's vision for America: to silence anyone they disagree with. But Kelly will not be silenced. She will always fight for everyday Georgians and push back against this out-of-control cancel culture.
Click the photo below to see footage:
In addition to her tour, Kelly also stood up for conservative values on and off the campaign trail. On Monday, she slammed liberal puppet Raphael Warnock for twisting the gospel to justify the Left's immoral abortion-on-demand agenda. Kelly also condemned left-wing hypocrite Nancy Pelosi for her trip to the salon while everyday Americans are not afforded such a luxury. In a Breitbart op-ed, Kelly further denounced the BLM political organization, especially its anti-moms-and-dads agenda to destroy the nuclear family. She re-affirmed her rock-solid commitment to the men and women of law enforcement.
Finally, she continued to expose career politician Doug Collins for his 300+ votes with ""good friend"" Stacey Abrams and his votes for gun control, lighter sentences for violent criminals and his support for the ""largest tax increase in Georgia history.""

ICYMI: SENATOR LOEFFLER INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO CRACK DOWN ON GANGS
ATLANTA – Yesterday, conservative businesswoman and political outsider Kelly Loeffler introduced legislation to strengthen federal sentencing guidelines for gang-related crimes and create a nationwide database to track gang activity. In practice, the Cracking Down on Gangs and Deporting Criminals Act of 2020 would make it easier to put gang members behind bars by increasing sentences for gang-related crimes. It also increases the likelihood of deporting a gang member who is in the country illegally. Loeffler's legislation is endorsed by Governor Brian Kemp, Attorney General Chris Carr, and Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vic Reynolds.
""At a time when Democratic Mayors across the country are failing to stand up for the safety of our loved ones, we must take the lead and crack down on the dangerous gangs that are wreaking havoc on our communities,"" said Senator Loeffler. ""I'm proud to have the backing of so many strong leaders in law enforcement, who support my plan to increase punishments for criminal gang members and deport those gang members who are living in our country illegally. It's time we get back to being a nation of law and order - and that starts with getting tough on our country's worst offenders.""

TRIAL LAWYER DOUG COLLINS PROMISED TO ""SHOULDER THAT BURDEN"" FOR MURDERERS, RAPISTS, CHILD ABUSERS
ATLANTA - Before morphing into a full-time career politician, Doug Collins was a criminal defense attorney who put his paycheck above public safety. As a partner at Collins & Csider, Collins worked around the clock to keep his clients out of jail. The firm marketed their services directly to vile criminals online and promised to ""shoulder that burden"" for murderers, rapists and child abusers:
Collins came through for his criminal clients, successfully securing reduced or dismissed charges for several accused of armed robbery, kidnapping and aggravated assault. Several of Collins' most notorious criminal clients became repeat offenders.
""Doug Collins and his firm actively and aggressively marketed his legal services to some of Georgia's most dangerous and vile criminals,"" said Stephen Lawson, Communications Director. ""He was unapologetic in his pursuit of reduced sentencing for violent offenders who went on to commit more crimes and put Georgia families at risk.
""It’s clear that Kelly Loeffler is the only conservative in this race who can proudly stand with President Trump as he fights to restore law and order in America by putting dangerous criminals behind bars where they belong. Doug Collins would be better off running for Mayor of Portland or Chicago where his record of lawlessness would be applauded by the woke mob and liberal electorate.""
Background
Collins & Csider’s Website Marketed Its Services To Defendants Accused Of Felonies And Misdemeanors (Collins & Csider, Archived 8/12/15)
Collins & Csider Offered To Quash Prosecutions By “Talking To The Officers Involved In Arrest” And Persuading Prosecutors To Dismiss Cases Or Reduce Them To A Lesser Offense.” “Over the years, we have prevented cases from being filed by talking to the officers involved in arrest. We have also been successful in persuading prosecutors to dismiss cases or reduce them to a lesser offense by exposing the weakness of a case. So, you see, you never know what type of a positive outcome can be achieved with your case, unless you take the time to call us. Your first consultation is free, and in some cases I can meet you at a time and place that's convenient for you.” (Collins & Csider, Archived 8/12/15)
Collins & Csider Offered To “Defend False Allegations Of [Domestic] Abuse.” “Domestic violence includes both emotional and physical abuse, threats, stalking and similar mistreatment. Our lawyers can determine whether a Petition under the Family Violence Act is appropriate or whether a Restraining Order should be entered within the pending divorce action. We can also defend false allegations of abuse.” (Collins & Csider, Archived 8/12/15)
In June 2008, Collins Defended Jeremy Scroger, Shacara Rucker, Shinard Cook, Sidney Howell, And Siedah Smith On Charges Of Armed Robbery, Criminal Conspiracy, Two Kidnappings, Four Aggravated Assaults, And Theft. Rucker Was Also Charged With Possessing A Firearm For Use In A Crime; The Charge Was Eventually Dismissed. Scroger, Rucker, And Cook Were Found Guilty Of Criminal Conspiracy And Two Kidnappings, Though The Kidnappings Were Amended To Lighter Charges. The Armed Robbery, Aggravated Assault, And Theft Charges Against Scroger, Rucker, And Cook Were Dismissed. (Case No. 2009CR000650, Hall County Superior Court, Filed 6/30/08)
Rucker, Howell, And Smith Went On To Commit More Crimes, Including Battery, Theft, And Obstructing A Police Officer. (Case No. 2010SR000778, Hall County State Court, Filed 2/16/10; Case No. 2008SR005735, Hall County State Court, Filed 8/12/08; Hall County Courts, Accessed 2/5/20)
The Defendants Reportedly Robbed A McDonald’s Restaurant At Gunpoint, Forcing Employees Into A Walk-In Cooler. “Five people have been arrested in connection with the early morning armed robbery of a Flowery Branch McDonald’s restaurant, including an employee whom investigators believe was involved. Hall County Sheriff’s Col. Jeff Strickland said two females and two males were let into the restaurant at 3 a.m. Friday by an employee, supposedly to use the bathroom. One of the four suspects pulled out a small caliber handgun and forced two of the restaurant’s three employees into a walk-in cooler. The third employee opened the safe for the robbers and handed over an undisclosed amount of cash, Strickland said. No one was injured and the cooler was not locked…After questioning the employees, investigators determined that one of the McDonald’s workers, 24-year-old Jeremy Scroger, assisted in the robbery, Strickland said. After securing a search warrant, investigators recovered the handgun and the stolen money from the Mazda, Strickland said. Scroger was charged with armed robbery and kidnapping. Also charged with armed robbery and kidnapping were Sidney Lewis Howell, 17, Shinard Ryaston Cook, 18, Siedah Yasmeen Smith, 21, and Shacarra Rucker, 18.” (Stephen Gurr, “Five Are Arrested In McDonalds Robbery,” Gainesville Times, 5/29/09)

CRIMINALS FOR COLLINS: MEET DANNY CLORE
ATLANTA - Before he was a career politician, Doug Collins made big bucks as a criminal defense attorney. Doug and his partner, Tom Csider, worked diligently to get criminal charges reduced or dropped for violent criminals - including illegal immigrants, sex offenders, drug dealers, and other heinous offenders. After they successfully freed these criminals, many of their defendants went on to commit more crimes in communities across Georgia.
Today, let's take a closer look at Danny Clore - one of the criminals Doug worked to free, and the inaugural member of the Criminals for Collins Coalition.
In 2009, Doug defended Danny Clore on charges of meth distribution and marijuana possession. The meth charge was dismissed, and the marijuana charge was discharged (thanks, Doug!). Unfortunately, Danny went on to commit more crimes, including aggravated assault, illegal possession of a firearm and obstructing a police officer. In 2015, Danny led the police on a high-speed chase after shooting at two vehicles with passengers inside. When the police finally caught and arrested Danny, he was found in possession of meth.
Obviously, Danny Clore should never have been on the streets. But thanks to Doug Collins, Danny slipped justice to commit more crimes and put Georgia families at risk.
In the race for the U.S. Senate, it's clear that Georgians cannot trust D.C. Doug to keep them safe. There's only one law-and-order conservative in this race, and that's Kelly Loeffler.
Background
In July 2009, Collins Defended Danny Clore On Charges Of Methamphetamine Distribution And Misdemeanor Possession Of Marijuana. (Case No. 2009CR000723, Hall County Superior Court, Filed 7/17/09)
The Meth Distribution Charge Was Dismissed While The Marijuana Charge Was Conditionally Discharged. (Case No. 2009CR000723, Hall County Superior Court, Filed 7/17/09)
Clore Went On To Commit More Crimes, Including Aggravated Assault, Illegal Possession Of A Firearm, And Obstructing A Police Officer. (Hall County Courts, Accessed 2/5/20)
Clore Led Police On A High-Speed Chase In 2015 After Shooting At Two Vehicles With Occupants Inside Them; Meth Was Found On His Person When He Was Arrested. “A Gainesville man wanted in Hall County in connection with a shooting was arrested Saturday after dogs and deputies tracked him through the woods of Rabun County. ‘We continued tracking (Danny Ray Clore) and later located a camo (waterproof) box that contained drugs and other .380 magazines,’ according to the report. ‘Minutes later (Clore) was located hiding behind a large log on the ground…’ Deputies responded to that incident around 1:30 p.m. to reports of someone ‘firing rounds from an automatic weapon,’ Hall County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Deputy Nicole Bailes said. ‘Clore shot at two vehicles that each had two occupants inside the vehicles at the time of the incident,’ Bailes wrote in an email… Officers chased Clore, who reportedly was ‘weaving in and out and traveling at a high rate of speed...’ ‘(The officer) then searched in the leaves where (Clore) was laying and located a Ruger .380 pistol and a Ziploc bag containing what appeared to (be) methamphetamine,’ according to the report. He was charged with possession of methamphetamine, fleeing and eluding by the Rabun County Sheriff’s Office.” (Nick Watson, “Authorities: Gainesville Shooting Suspect Captured After Chase Through Woods,” Gainesville Times, 11/23/15)

918,"Friend,
After another fantastic week, it's obvious: Kelly Loeffler is Georgia's choice for conservative leadership in the United States Senate. It's clear that families across our state want a businessperson and a political outsider they can trust to deliver results and take on the Radical Left and D.C. Swamp.
On Tuesday, a new poll showed Kelly with a decisive lead in her race. The poll, which was conducted last week, shows Senator Loeffler leading with 26%, followed by Doug Collins at 17% and Raphael Warnock at 17%. In major news, Senator Loeffler also leads Collins among Republicans by 18% and by 25% among Trump voters. To view the full poll results, click HERE.
Kelly also had a great time meeting with supporters at the grand opening of her Athens Field Office. She was joined by Georgia Insurance Commissioner John King – one of the several statewide elected officials who have endorsed her campaign for Senate. After the grand opening, Kelly spoke to packed houses at monthly meetings of the Athens-Clarke and Walton County Republican Parties. Click HERE to see photos from the Athens Field Office grand opening.
On Thursday, Kelly was joined for a visit to the Georgia Cyber Center in Augusta by yet another high-profile, statewide official: Georgia First Lady Marty Kemp. Kelly and Marty toured the facilities, met with local professional leaders, and were briefed on Georgia's investment into the Center and its impact on economic development and the cybersecurity workforce.
Kelly and Marty also discussed curbing sex trafficking in Georgia, as well as Augusta University’s efforts to combat the coronavirus. They emphasized the University's telehealth program and the state and federal funding it has received as a result of three letters Kelly wrote to the Federal Communications Commission.
With all the work she's doing for Georgia, it's no wonder Kelly has earned the support of Georgia's grassroots conservatives. Just this week, Kelly was widely praised when she publicly demanded answers from Planned Parenthood regarding their PPP loan abuse and heinous sale of baby body parts. She won support from gun owners and gun rights interest groups like AmmoLand – which stated that ""Second Amendment supporters should keep Loeffler in [the Senate]."" She also took a strong stand with President Trump in support of the SEC's decision to let college football players participate in the 2020 season.
With these strong conservative credentials, it's no wonder she was the ONLY U.S. Senator to receive a PERFECT, 100-percent score on Heritage Action for America’s legislative scorecard for the 116th Congress – making her the most conservative U.S. senator. It's also worth noting that Kelly holds a perfect, 100-percent record of voting with President Trump.
And in case you missed it, Kelly also appeared on Fox News recently to praise President Trump’s executive action to help American workers and families. As Kelly said:
“The President is truly a man of his word. He wants to make sure we don’t have blue-state bailouts, we want to get back to the blue-collar boom that he built in the last three years of this economy, and we know we can get back there and do it safely. But we can’t advance the radical agenda that they propose, where their package mentions cannabis 20 times more than it mentions jobs.”
Click HERE or on the photo below to watch the full interview.
Finally, after Sleepy Joe Biden announced Phony Kamala Harris as his nominee for vice president, Kelly hammered Kamala's socialist policies, exposed Twitter for hiring Kamala's former press secretary and slammed Kamala for helping to free criminal defendants charged with murder, violent felonies and sex crimes.
If that seems familiar, it's probably because Doug Collins spent years doing the same thing. Both Doug and Kamala are soft on crime, and they put the interests of violent criminals over those of hardworking Americans. But that's not the only way these two are similar. Like Phony Kamala Harris, D.C. Doug is a career politician who will say or do anything to climb the political ladder. Even though Doug and Kamala share a striking resemblance, we will not let Georgia become the new California. Kelly will always support law enforcement, crack down on gangs, and support President Trump as he restores law and order and keeps America safe.

Kelly Loeffler
Alex,
American cities are under siege.
Radical liberal policies and their advocates have enabled and emboldened rioters. They have undermined the strength of our police forces. They have turned a blind eye to the violent crime surging in major cities all across our country.
We cannot allow communities, businesses, and lives to be threatened. We must support those who will do what it takes to keep Americans safe.
That’s why it’s more important than ever to send Kelly back to Washington.
Since taking her Oath of Office in January, she’s made keeping us safe her number one priority.
Kelly has pushed anti-gang legislation that would help us keep violent criminals off the street, fought back against every attempt to defund the brave men and women in law enforcement, and called out the radical left for their dangerous and irresponsible attacks on the rule of law.
Support Kelly and help her keep Americans safe —>
You can trust Kelly to protect us, but you can’t trust Doug Collins.
D.C. Doug Collins has been putting Georgians at risk his entire career.
In the Georgia State House, he partnered with Stacey Abrams to reduce sentences for violent offenders and tried to raise fees on firearm licenses in Georgia — hurting our ability to defend ourselves. And as a defense attorney, Doug made his living putting dangerous and violent criminals back on the streets - and many broke the law again!
Support Kelly and help her keep Americans safe —>
We need leaders who know what it takes to keep our communities safe and who won’t back down in the face of the mob and their dangerous policies.
Alex, that’s Kelly.
Thank you for your support,

KL
Alex,
Kelly Loeffler is a conservative businesswoman and political outsider who has delivered results for hardworking Georgians and advanced our conservative agenda in the United States Senate.
In the 10 months she has served in the Senate, Kelly has achieved more for Georgia families than most career politicians accomplish in 10 years.
As one of her first actions, Kelly introduced legislation to protect innocent life, and she has proven herself a relentless advocate for the unborn. She is endorsed by every major pro-life organization in America, including the National Right to Life, Susan B. Anthony List, and Family Policy Alliance.
Kelly is also fighting around the clock to protect our 2nd-Amendment rights, take care of our veterans, hold Big Tech accountable for their censorship of conservative speech, and notably, Kelly cast one of the deciding votes to acquit President Trump during the sham impeachment.
Donate and Vote Tuesday, November 3
In Washington, Kelly took a firm stance in support of our police and against the dangerous “defund the police” movement. In fact, Kelly has introduced legislation to defund cities that defund their police, crack down on gangs and illegal immigration, and to make looting small businesses a federal crime.
Kelly has stood with President Trump to restore law and order, and she will always back the blue.
When the pandemic hit, Kelly played a critical role in securing grants and funding for Georgia farmers, infrastructure, and rural hospitals. She was instrumental in passing the CARES Act to deliver PPP loans to boost struggling small businesses. Importantly, Kelly has also taken strong action to hold China accountable for spreading the virus.
Unfortunately, Doug Collins has manufactured lies about Kelly, because he’s trying to run from his failed record as a career politician. We all know that Doug Collins is part of the Swamp establishment that Kelly went to Washington to drain. Doug has a long history of siding with liberals like Stacey Abrams and Nancy Pelosi to raise taxes, weaken the 2nd Amendment, and fund amnesty, sanctuary cities, and Common Core.
That’s not the kind of “conservative” we need representing us in the Senate.
You can find all of the information—and facts—on that HERE. And perhaps the most useful tool to share with family, friends, and neighbors who are undecided is this informative link that compares Kelly’s record of accomplishments to Doug’s record of failures: [[URL REDACTED]]
Kelly Loeffler is the pro-life, pro-Trump, pro-wall, and pro-gun conservative businesswoman and political outsider Georgia families can trust.
She is the only candidate in her race that has taken on – and defeated – the Swamp, the special interests, and the radical cancel culture. On November 3, the choice is clear: please VOTE Kelly Loeffler for U.S. Senate.
Donate and Vote Tuesday, November 3

Kelly Loeffler
Alex,
Don’t let Doug Collins fool you. He’s not who you think he is.
Doug Collins is NOT a conservative — he only plays one when the cameras are on.
He says he stands with President Trump and fights for conservative causes, but a close look at his record in Atlanta and in Washington D.C. proves that he’s all talk.
There are no results, only rhetoric.
Get the truth about Doug Collins
As a state representative, Doug Collins worked hand-in-hand with Stacey Abrams to raise taxes on Georgia families and businesses — tax-hikes that were vetoed every single time.
His time in Washington has been more of the same. Do these look like conservative votes to you?
* He supported billions in new tax increases and all of Obama’s budgets.
* He voted to fund Planned Parenthood three times.
* He worked with radical Democrats to free violent felons and fund sanctuary cities. He has repeatedly proven that he’s weak on crime and illegal immigration.
Get the truth about Doug Collins
Doug Collins talks a big game about fighting for President Trump’s agenda, but he refused to say if he would even vote for the President the day before the 2016 Republican National Convention and has a history of praising Senator Mitt Romney, who voted to impeach President Trump.
Georgians can’t trust Doug Collins. Period.
Don’t let him fool you anymore — find out who Doug Collins really is.

Kelly Loeffler
We know that times are tough and money is tight right now for lots of families, farmers, and workers in Georgia and across the country.

Alex,
Democrats are getting desperate.
They’re going all out, spending money like crazy, trying to push their liberal agenda on all of us. Alex, we need them to know it’s not going to work. They’re not going to BUY this election!
That’s why we need YOUR help to meet our FINAL Mid-Month fundraising goal by 11:59PM TOMORROW.
Can you chip in now?
By donating below, you are making an immediate contribution:
ONE CLICK DONATE: $100
ONE CLICK DONATE: $75
ONE CLICK DONATE: $50
ONE CLICK DONATE: $25
If you've saved payment information with Revv or WinRed, your donation will go through automatically.
If we reach this goal, we can defeat the extremists who are working hard to:
* defund our police
* take our guns
* open our borders
* and coddle China (even in this pandemic!)
But the new numbers we checked this morning show us $6,522 short!
So, if you can, please chip in before 11:59PM tomorrow to show your support for Senator Loeffler, it would be a GREAT help!: [[URL REDACTED]]
Don’t forget, Alex, this is the final stretch. Your support counts now, more than ever.

Kelly Loeffler for Senate
Alex,
Last week, the woke mob tried to cancel Kelly for standing up to the radical left and defending the American flag.
But Kelly didn’t blink, and she’s not going to let the radical left stop her from doing her job and keeping Americans safe.
A poll last week showed that voters think cancel culture is going too far and that Americans aren’t going to stand for this kind of character assassination.
Alex, it’s simple — voters don’t want leaders who back down to the left. They want leaders who will stand up to the mob and do what it takes to protect their families and communities.
And that leader is Kelly.
She just introduced a bill that would make it easier for our law enforcement agencies to take gang members off the streets and create a federal database of gang activity within the Department of Justice.
Donate and become a citizen cosponsor
Kelly is acknowledging a simple truth — that gang violence is destroying lives, families, and communities across America.
According to experts, there are more than a million gang members in America and gangs currently pose the greatest public safety threat to American citizens.
Kelly’s bill would help law enforcement agencies coordinate and work together to keep Americans safe from gang violence and prosecute the perpetrators of it. It’s a simple, commonsense law that will help keep us safe from the violence plaguing our country.
Donate below and become a citizen cosponsor.

Kelly Loeffler
Alex,
This is huge news.
Sheriffs throughout Georgia just endorsed Kelly and denounced Doug Collins for being weak on crime and putting communities at risk.
“Kelly Loeffler has proven that she will stand with our law enforcement community to protect Georgia families and communities. Doug Collins has made a career out of putting the interests of criminals before the safety of Georgia’s families...Georgia needs a leader who will always stand up for law and order — not violent criminals – which is why we’re proud to endorse Kelly Loeffler for United States Senate."" - Georgia’s Sheriffs
Join them in endorsing Kelly
Kelly has been fighting to keep our communities safe since she stepped foot on the Senate floor, and she’s had the back of law enforcement every step of the way.
She’s the only law and order candidate in our race and that’s just a fact. Just take a look at her record compared to Doug Collins.
Doug has been weak on crime his entire career. Instead of working with law enforcement to keep our communities safe, he worked with Stacey Abrams to shorten prison sentences for violent criminals.
As a criminal defense attorney, he put families, businesses, and communities at risk by putting dangerous offenders back on the streets.
Kelly’s record on crime couldn’t be more different than Doug’s.
She’s protected law enforcement budgets from the radical left’s dangerous attempts to defund the police every step of the way. Just last week, she introduced a bill to help law enforcement crackdown on criminal gang activity and keep dangerous criminals away from our communities and behind bars.
Keeping Americans safe is Kelly’s number one priority, and her record proves how serious she is.

Alex,
The violence that Atlanta witnessed over the July 4th weekend is tragic, inexcusable, and worst of all — avoidable.
I’m heartbroken, and frankly, furious. The loss of life is horrific on any occasion, and even more gut-wrenching when the victim is young a child.
We cannot continue to allow our communities to suffer. We must reject the radical left and their “Defund Police” movement. We must stand with law enforcement and protect Georgia families from crime and violence.
I encourage you to read my full response to the lawlessness in Atlanta and join me in solemn prayer for those who lost their lives.

> Trump says he is protecting your 2nd amendment right to keep and bear arms. Let’s not forget that Trump radicalized the American people and co-opted the Republican party. Trump is a New York Democrat who used to be pro-choice and in favor of stronger gun regulations. In the long run, a failure to regulate guns and prevent them from getting into the hands of family annihilators, mass murders, and other criminals actually undermines the 2nd amendment, and of course, is a prime example of the American carnage being caused by this administration. We cannot continue to have this many unprovoked mass murders of innocent American citizens without public opinion eventually turning against the 2nd amendment. If you want to enforce your right to keep and bear arms, the best way would be to prevent mass murders which reflect poorly on all American gun owners, however unfairly, by guilt of association. Remember that it was just over 100 years ago that alcohol was banned by an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

> The USA is a bastion of unprecedented innovation, ingenuity, intellect, financial and military power, and charity. We are a grand experiment in representative democracy that has shown that government for the people, by the people, and of the people can work. Donald Trump is possibly the most unqualified president in history and is testing the limits of this system. The Constitution’s framers knew George Washington would likely be the first president, and imbued the office of President of the United States with sweeping, grand powers with the hope that he would set an example for each future president to use these powers for the good of the people and of the Union. Donald Trump, like King George III, is a tyrant and a usurper who should be removed from office and must be voted out of office. He has committed crimes against the United States, such as the recent Ukraine affair, and should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

Of course there was that SCOTUS decision saying that paying FICA taxes does not confer property rights, but we all know it is only fair that people who have paid in their whole life have earned their benefits. The GOP talking points are all about pitting people against each other, and they are very good at using psychological gamesmanship as the people who are most vocal and upset about so-called welfare queens (which is based in racism; see Dow, 2014) and having to pay for others' so-called laziness are the ones who actually are living paycheck-to-paycheck possibly below the federal poverty line. They would most benefit from Democratic rather than Republican policies and many are actually going without health insurance or are affected by tariffs now but turn a blind eye to it.

Those who earn over approximately $132,000 per year do not pay anything more toward these programs. If we got rid of the cap it could be fully funded ad infinitum. Some will say this is not doable but we used to have much higher federal income taxes at the top bracket. Of course many high-earners do not get most of their money from wages. Wage-earners do not have the luxury of long-term capital gains tax at lower rates with no FICA deductions, getting to time when they take their profits, tax loss harvesting, 1031 accounts for real estate, and so many other advantages.

There would probably need to be a modification whereby such high earners are capped on the outgoing end in what they can receive per month in retirement despite contributing more. Pundits' ideas that this will ruin the system by making high earners have to subsidize low earners is overblown... Progressivism requires such sacrifices and we all know the USA is, has long been, and will continue to be the best country for entrepreneurship, small and large businesses alike, and upward mobility (although we need to extend these opportunities to everyone!).

You could actually just get rid of the cap on the employer portion and leave the $132,000 cap in place on the employee portion and it might fund SS/Medicare in perpetuity without anyone really feeling it. Already, if someone works for multiple employers they have to file a tax form to get the portion of their personal employee FICA taxes back on income that exceeded $132,000 when combined between all their jobs, but the employers themselves are individually subjected to the cap with respect to that employee, so there are some employer FICA taxes being paid for individuals in excess of the annual cap in income already.

It turns out Congressman Michael Waltz has been touching the ""third rail"" for a long time—he blatantly called for slashing entitlements. I've typed up a transcript with commentary below that really highlights his unfortunate positions, and I've integrated the recent Trump interview comments and a 2016 video of Michael Waltz when he was anti-Trump. This is also available on my website at: Now that they've ripped us off with massive corporate giveaways to the rich, Michael Waltz and Donald Trump want to sack Social Security and Medicare

I've copied Ambassador Nancy Soderberg, who of course was the 2018 Democratic candidate for FL CD6 and may have some insight on this. Please feel free to forward and share this with friends.

>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>> Moderator: Alright, Mr. Waltz, this question goes to you first. The recent tax cuts supported by President Trump and the Republican Congress have no doubt helped to ignite the economy. [Thripp: Now we have seen little wage growth but huge corporate profits, so this is debatable at best.]

>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>> Michael Waltz: You said tax cuts, Pat?
>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>> Moderator: Yes. And who doesn’t like a tax cut, right? We all like tax cuts. [Applause] But, but, those tax cuts came without any corresponding spending cuts. That means the deficit is rising significantly. Projected to be about $800 and something billion dollars this year. It’s now going up more rapidly than it did during the last years of the Obama presidency according to, that’s according to the Congressional Budget Office. So, my question is this: What spending cuts would you make to offset that budget deficit, and how much, tell me how much those cuts would save taxpayers?
>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>> Michael Waltz: Well again, it’s my own experience with my own business trying to build it as an entrepreneur. Uhh, you know, most of that time was under the Obama administration. Uhh, we couldn’t get a loan because Sarbanes–Oxley [Thripp: Being unable to comply with this post-Enron law is not really something to be proud of], I already talked about the burden of Obamacare. Overtaxed, over regulated. As soon as President Trump came in and got the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, and that’s an important component—Tax Cut and Jobs Act passed, we put that new rate in and hired 6 more people. Our economy is on fire. 4.1% GDP, the lowest minority, uhh, unemployment in American history, and I plan to get up to D.C. to continue that. I would not have signed, uhh I would not—excuse me, I would not have voted for the omnibus, that added $1.3 trillion in debt. Our debt is our biggest, I think, one of our biggest national security issues. It is a burden on our future generation, our kids and our grandkids, and we have to get a hold of it. The way to get a hold of it, and, and, this is what we’re gonna have to do, we’re gonna have to go after the non-discretionary portion: The entitlement reform portion. We’re nibbling around the edges with all of these other cuts. That’s the part that we have to go over. We need politicians that get up there and have the guts to go after it. It’s one of the reasons I’m on the record for term limits. It’s that you get in there, you get stuff done, and you get back to the real world. That’s what our founding fathers intended.
>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>> Moderator: Just to, uhh, clarify one thing though: If we go after entitlements, what does that amount to? Uhh, if you cut, let’s say, and what are those entitlements? Is Social Security an entitlement?
>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>> Michael Waltz: Yeah. [Dissent from audience]

>>>>>>>>> Moderator: Or, is Medicare an entitlement? What entitlements, and how much would that bring in—how much would that save?
>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>> Michael Waltz: Well it’s, umm I mean it’s, you know, I don’t necessarily have the numbers in front of me, but it’s by far—it’s 70% of our budget. So figure out 70% of our $6 trillion budget. [Thripp: It’s 50% of a $4 trillion federal budget. If you count interest on the national debt you are close to 70%, but Waltz wasn’t proposing defaulting on interest payments.] Pat, you’re better at math than I am. But, umm, that’s [Social Security and Medicare] the part that we have to have the guts to go after, and as soon as any Republican says that, we see the ads start flying from the left. And you know, look, the policies are in place to do that. Simpson–Bowles and others have put forward real recommendations, but the political will is lacking, and I think we need a new generation to get up there and say “enough—I’m not going to pass this debt on to my kids.” But, very quickly, who’s the biggest holder of our debt? The Chinese. By far. [Thripp: No, not by far. Not even true. Japan owns more debt than China.] So we have a massive trade, uhh, deficit. That money’s going over to China, they’re buying our debt with it, and we have this vicious loop that we have to get out of.

Mr. Waltz supports slashing your Social Security and Medicare to pay for it. We CANNOT elect Mr. Waltz or Mr. Trump to a second term. I, Richard Thripp, am running for Waltz’s seat as a progressive Democrat who will not cut Social Security and Medicare. Social Security can be fully funded ad infinitum by raising or eliminating the cap on wages it applies to, instead of its present form as a regressive tax that taxes high earners at lower percentages than the middle class.

930,"Hi all,
Here is my typed response, composed in real time, to Donald Trump’s 2020 State of the Union response on February 4, 2020.
Donald Trump began his State of the Union address boasting about how great the economy is doing, and claiming that America is now respected again on the world stage. This is absurd given that he is laughed at and booed on the world stage, frequently has to be schooled on basic issues such as Chairman Xi explaining North Korea to him, and cannot even visit the United Kingdom due to being so despised.
“The state of our union is stronger than ever before.” Actually, it is more fractured, divided, and endangered than it has been in a long time. We have huge political divisions stoked by the most petty president in modern history, and a president leading an executive branch via unvarnished incompetence and unprecedented power grabs reducing the status of the two other branches of federal government.
The unemployment rate for African Americans was lower in the 1950s but the current statistic being used was not calculated going back this far using the present criteria. Trump’s focus on the unemployment rate is pretty ridiculous considering that he said it was a phony statistic not telling the true story of American suffering when it was trending lower during the Obama administration.
People being taken off the food stamp rolls and “lifted off welfare” is a ridiculous statement. The administration is forcing needy people off benefits. Wealth stratification and corporate welfare is at an all-time high. Real wages are not increasing much if at all.
“Blue collar boom”—more like American carnage. Trotting out phony statistics about real wages going up for the have-nots does not convince anyone with any real knowledge. The wealthy are robbing us blind with the help of the GOP tacked straight on the national debt.
Overall, Trump’s focus on the economy is opportunistic and laden with falsehoods. The economy is doing well according to many popular measures, but someone who told us Americans would never be forgotten is certainly forgetting a lot of Americans when it comes to everyone but the top 1%.
“I keep our promises. We did our job.” Pretty rich for someone who said he would give us something better than Obamacare, build a wall that Mexico would pay for, and balance the budget within 8 years… instead we are on track for dangerous and ever-increasing deficits.
“As we restore American leadership throughout the world.” Was it leadership to abandon our allies, the Kurds, in Syria? To threaten Ukraine financially to influence a presidential election? To hob-nob with North Koreans many of which met Trump and were subsequently executed? He “loves” Mr. Kim? He acts as a shill for Mr. Putin in Russia, which is no example of leadership.
Military spending is off the charts and out-of-control. There is no getting around this. It doesn’t matter how patriotic you are or how much you support and love our troops and contractors. American military spending and militarism must decline, sooner rather than later.
This week, I’m visiting Washington, DC with my wife and son. I visited the U.S. Capitol and Supreme Court yesterday, and Mount Vernon, home of George Washington, today. I also re-read the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence. Trump is a grand disappointment.
Many of the complaints about King George III in the Declaration of Independence could easily be replaced with “Donald Trump” and “Mitch McConnell.” Read through it and you will see. I may make a video about this later!
“No parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school.” Perhaps they should not be sent to a school that hates gay children or perpetuates patriarchy and misogyny? Why don’t we work on improving the government schools instead of undermining them?
“A good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and high quality healthcare system on earth.” Allowing states to slash Medicaid benefits via block grants undermines the poorest and lowest income Americans. Repealing or attempting to invalidate the Affordable Care Act makes healthcare unaffordable and inaccessible for Americans.
“We will always protect your Medicare and we will always protect your Social Security, always.” Trump just said in a recent interview that he will look into cutting both of these programs! The insane national deficit is funding a stock market boom that reflects large corporations receiving an unprecedented amount of corporate welfare that is tacked directly onto our massive national debt. About 50% of Americans have no stocks and many others merely have them in retirement accounts such as 401(k) and are not substantially benefitting from this illegal, anti-American gravy train.
The so-called do-nothing Democrats are getting plenty done in the U.S. House of Representatives. We should be talking about the do-nothing, obstructionist Republicans. Mitch McConnell, the “grim reaper,” is preventing hundreds of passed bills from being heard in the Senate. On prescription drug prices, the House passed the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act which Trump will not mention and McConnell will block from becoming law.
Giving Rush Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom is an insult to our veterans and war heroes. It’s an insult to Rosa Parks and so many others. It undermines American values and confidence in American institutions. Rush Limbaugh is a sexist and promotes rape. He said, regarding sexual consent: “How many of you guys . . . have learned that ‘no’ means ‘yes’ if you know how to spot it?” We may as well give the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Harvey Weinstein or Kevin Spacey.
Rush Limbaugh, like Donald Trump, claims, with no facts, that the climate crisis and all of climate science is a hoax. Such propaganda will kill far more humans than were ever killed in the Holocaust. We are talking hundreds of millions of people, within this century, who will die because of the human-caused climate crisis which is charging full-steam ahead under the Republican party in the United States of America, the corrupt coal-funded Labor Party in Australia, the Communist Party’s insanity in the People’s Republic of China, and beyond.
Trump speaks of keeping America safe. Does promoting racism, hatred, and division help such safety? Wasn’t the mass murderer at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas—a domestic home-grown terrorist—spurred on by our president’s vitriol?
Trump speaks of merit-based immigration, but his administration turns away more immigrants than any president in modern history. He won’t give protected status to refugees in war zones, in Venezuela, or victims of Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas.
“We celebrate faith. We cherish religion.” Only SOME religions. The religions we like. Others are scapegoated and attacked by Trump’s followers.
Trump says he is protecting your 2nd amendment right to keep and bear arms. Let’s not forget that Trump radicalized the American people and co-opted the Republican party. Trump is a New York Democrat who used to be pro-choice and in favor of stronger gun regulations. In the long run, a failure to regulate guns and prevent them from getting into the hands of family annihilators, mass murders, and other criminals actually undermines the 2nd amendment, and of course, is a prime example of the American carnage being caused by this administration. We cannot continue to have this many unprovoked mass murders of innocent American citizens without public opinion eventually turning against the 2nd amendment. If you want to enforce your right to keep and bear arms, the best way would be to prevent mass murders which reflect poorly on all American gun owners, however unfairly, by guilt of association. Remember that it was just over 100 years ago that alcohol was banned by an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
The USA is a bastion of unprecedented innovation, ingenuity, intellect, financial and military power, and charity. We are a grand experiment in representative democracy that has shown that government for the people, by the people, and of the people can work. Donald Trump is possibly the most unqualified president in history and is testing the limits of this system. The Constitution’s framers knew George Washington would likely be the first president, and imbued the office of President of the United States with sweeping, grand powers with the hope that he would set an example for each future president to use these powers for the good of the people and of the Union. Donald Trump, like King George III, is a tyrant and a usurper who should be removed from office and must be voted out of office. He has committed crimes against the United States, such as the recent Ukraine affair, and should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Signing off,

Progressivism requires such sacrifices and we all know the USA is, has long been, and will continue to be the best country for entrepreneurship, small and large businesses alike, and upward mobility (although we need to extend these opportunities to everyone!).

You could actually just get rid of the cap on the employer portion and leave the $132,000 cap in place on the employee portion and it might fund SS/Medicare in perpetuity without anyone really feeling it. Already, if someone works for multiple employers they have to file a tax form to get the portion of their personal employee FICA taxes back on income that exceeded $132,000 when combined between all their jobs, but the employers themselves are individually subjected to the cap with respect to that employee, so there are some employer FICA taxes being paid for individuals in excess of the annual cap in income already.

It’s now going up more rapidly than it did during the last years of the Obama presidency according to, that’s according to the Congressional Budget Office. So, my question is this: What spending cuts would you make to offset that budget deficit, and how much, tell me how much those cuts would save taxpayers?

Uhh, we couldn’t get a loan because Sarbanes–Oxley [Thripp: Being unable to comply with this post-Enron law is not really something to be proud of], I already talked about the burden of Obamacare. Overtaxed, over regulated. As soon as President Trump came in and got the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, and that’s an important component—Tax Cut and Jobs Act passed, we put that new rate in and hired 6 more people. Our economy is on fire. 4.1% GDP, the lowest minority, uhh, unemployment in American history, and I plan to get up to D.C. to continue that. I would not have signed, uhh I would not—excuse me, I would not have voted for the omnibus, that added $1.3 trillion in debt. Our debt is our biggest, I think, one of our biggest national security issues. It is a burden on our future generation, our kids and our grandkids, and we have to get a hold of it. The way to get a hold of it, and, and, this is what we’re gonna have to do, we’re gonna have to go after the non-discretionary portion: The entitlement reform portion. We’re nibbling around the edges with all of these other cuts. That’s the part that we have to go over. We need politicians that get up there and have the guts to go after it. It’s one of the reasons I’m on the record for term limits. It’s that you get in there, you get stuff done, and you get back to the real world. That’s what our founding fathers intended.

[Thripp: It’s 50% of a $4 trillion federal budget. If you count interest on the national debt you are close to 70%, but Waltz wasn’t proposing defaulting on interest payments.] Pat, you’re better at math than I am. But, umm, that’s [Social Security and Medicare] the part that we have to have the guts to go after, and as soon as any Republican says that, we see the ads start flying from the left. And you know, look, the policies are in place to do that. Simpson–Bowles and others have put forward real recommendations, but the political will is lacking, and I think we need a new generation to get up there and say “enough—I’m not going to pass this debt on to my kids.” But, very quickly, who’s the biggest holder of our debt? The Chinese. By far. [Thripp: No, not by far. Not even true. Japan owns more debt than China.] So we have a massive trade, uhh, deficit. That money’s going over to China, they’re buying our debt with it, and we have this vicious loop that we have to get out of.

I, Richard Thripp, am running for Waltz’s seat as a progressive Democrat who will not cut Social Security and Medicare. Social Security can be fully funded ad infinitum by raising or eliminating the cap on wages it applies to, instead of its present form as a regressive tax that taxes high earners at lower percentages than the middle class.

Patriot,
Far-left, socialist politicians pose an existential threat to the future of America.
All across the United States, we’ve seen failed leadership from liberal politicians lead to bending the knee to the Antifa mob instead of standing up to violent rioters and looters.
If the radical left gains any more power in November, we can expect even more of this lawlessness. Far-left politicians will push for open borders and defunding the police, and this crime, chaos, and destruction will spread to every corner of the country.
CLICK HERE TO STOP THE FAR-LEFT AGENDA
I’m running for Congress to stop this, defend our great president, and fight back against AOC’s socialist mob (and their best friends in the fake news media).
I’m asking for you to support my mission before midnight tonight to help my team reach our end-of-month goal in the fight against this extremism.
I stand with the Keep America Great agenda of President Trump, and if elected to Congress, I will be his #1 Fighter on the mission to restore Law and Order in our streets.
Help me accomplish this mission by pitching in today!
PITCH IN $5
PITCH IN $20.20 TO WIN IN 2020
PITCH IN ANY AMOUNT
We need more Trump Republicans in Congress and less RINOs who immediately become swamp creatures as soon as they get to Washington.
The Silent Majority has watched the radical left attempt to destroy our great country - but we are no longer silent.
Make your voice heard by supporting my conservative campaign for Congress, and we can send a message to the far-left that we won’t tolerate their lawlessness!

932,"Friend,
Again last night, Bernie Sanders refused to condemn Cuba.
Look at the record of the dictator he has repeatedly praised:
* Tens of thousands murdered, summarily executed for opposing the regime.
* Hundreds of thousands more sent to gulags and re-education camps.
* An untold number – estimated in the tens of thousands – lost at sea in desperate attempts to escape on makeshift rafts.
That’s just the beginning. Sanders has had a lifelong friendship with Nicaraguan strongman Daniel Ortega, a man responsible for mass murder and the wholesale persecution of political prisoners. Sanders honeymooned in the Soviet Union – a regime responsible for as many as 50 million deaths through political assassination, gulags, and state-sponsored genocide.
We knew this day was coming.
For decades, our colleges and universities have served to indoctrinate generations of students, assuring them that the Cold War was simply a misunderstanding between two super powers that were equally at fault. For decades, our press covered up the crimes of the socialists, lauding the likes of Castro.
Their work has brought us here: This is the new face of the Democrat Party – an avowed socialist selling misery and yet hailed by the younger generation as a prophet.
It falls on us to end this – to beat back this socialist attack on America. We have the right message and it is time we change the messenger.
That is my mission: To speak clearly and unequivocally against socialism. To stand up for the values that have made America great: liberty, opportunity, capitalism, and limited, Constitutional government.
That is my pledge to you.
As both a woman and a millennial, I will take on the radical liberals like AOC, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib. No one will be a tougher critic of their outrageous and dangerous policies than me. More than ever we need a strong voice for common sense, liberty, and young conservatives across America.
I hope you will consider supporting my campaign for Congress with a financial contribution.
Thank you,
Kat Cammack

935,"Stop Corruption, Drain the Swamp!
Dr. Byron Bush Calls for Greater
Accountability for All Government Officers
Nails Five-Part Plan to End Abuses of Power to the Door
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE MEDIA INQUIRIES:
[[URL REDACTED]]
Nashville, TN—Today, Dr. Byron Bush “nailed” his five-part proposal to root out government abuse of power and ensure equal access to justice to the doors of the Tennessee Supreme Court building and “e-nailed” it to state legislators, saying:
“Just as Martin Luther in 1517, and Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1963, issued powerful calls for justice and the end of an intolerable era of corruption and abuse of power at the highest levels of society, so, too, do we find ourselves facing down grave injustices and government abuses today.
I was deeply saddened to see the recent, tragic outcome of the Minneapolis Police officer’s abuse of power that took the life of George Floyd, an awful and senseless encounter like others we have seen before. I join with Americans of all different backgrounds and creeds who are demanding better from the government we entrust to uphold the law, keep us safe, and improve society by promoting peace and stability.
We must not forget the many forms that abuses of power take as they continue to be perpetrated at all levels of government, from uncalled for violence against individuals like Mr. Floyd, to the national security leaders who conspired to deprive President Trump’s team of their rights and liberty, to the local judges who rule to enrich their friends and supporters while ignoring the facts and the law. Whether seemingly small or severe, these crimes besmirch and betray the sacred principles of liberty, equality, and justice upon which our democratic society depends.
As the ancient image of blind justice so aptly depicts, true fairness can only be achieved when those in power act without regard to individual identity, whether marked by one’s race, religion, wealth, social status, or geography.
Since the first days of this campaign, I have been fighting against a system stacked to benefit the well-connected insiders at the expense of regular people. Unfortunately, that fight has been reinforced in the strongest imaginable terms by recent events.
As a true believer in a more limited, fair, and accountable government, I pledge to continue to work for reforms to achieve the promise of our American ideals for all people. I hope you will read my proposals and share your thoughts on how we can work together for a better future for our state and country.”
Background
* A shocking February 2020 report out of the University of Illinois-Chicago shows Tennessee is the country’s third most corrupt state after well-known offenders Louisiana and Illinois.
* Since announcing his candidacy and running TV Ads during this year’s Super Bowl highlighting the abuses of Judge James Martin of Williamson County and Appellate Judge Frank Clement, Dr. Bush has received numerous reports from citizens across the state plagued by the state’s corrupt system of powerfully-connected judges, attorneys, and politicians.
* Dr. Bush’s proposal contains five elements:
* FREE PUBLIC VIDEO STREAMING OF COURT PROCEEDINGS to increase transparency of our court processes;
* FULL DISCLOSURE of all parties involved in litigation to prevent a miscarriage of justice due to relationships, pro or con, which give preferential treatment;
* REQUIREMENT FOR JUDGES TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS SPECIFIC MATTERS UPON REQUEST to prevent judges from cherry-picking the material facts, facts-that-matter, to support the position of only one party;
* OPINION OF DISSENT allowed by the losing party to establish for the record the argument, statutes, and facts that may have been omitted and to show patterns where a judge has failed to uphold the law or has intentionally left out evidence; and
* LIMIT SWEEPING CLAIMS OF CREDIBLE OR NON-CREDIBLE TESTIMONY that judges use to shut out evidence undermining their preferred outcome from even appearing in the record.

936,"While Russia Puts Bounties on the Heads of our Troops--Trump Stays Silent
Hi Alex,
In early 2018, Russia attacked American troops in Syria. According to The New York Times, between 200-300 pro-Syrian fighters, including Russian mercenaries, were killed during the 4-hour battle.
That was my husband's unit.
Last night, I learned that as retaliation, Russia is working with the Taliban and offering bounties on the heads of American troops. And the Commander in Chief has known this for months--and did nothing to protect the lives of deployed service members.
This is not the first time the President of the United States has viewed service members as collateral damage. What I have witnessed as an Army wife for several years now is simple. Donald Trump is a national security threat.
After Russia shot at American soldiers in Syria, our President shook hands with Vladimir Putin. And chose to ignore the warnings and expertise of career intelligence officials when they reported that Russia was working to undermine America through cyber warfare.
After Russia shot at American soldiers in Syria, our President chose to abandon the allies who stood alongside American troops. He opened the gates of slaughter. He allowed Turkey to enact a mass genocide on the Kurdish people. American troops remained in the region, without Rules of Engagement orders--while Turkey shot at them.
After Russia shot at American soldiers in Syria, our President continued to rent out our men and women in uniform like for-hire mercenaries to Saudi Arabia.
After Russia shot at American soldiers in Syria, our President had a foreign leader assassinated in a foreign country, while American troops remained in country. As retaliation for our actions, Iran attacked our troops in Iraq, leaving 109 service members with brain injuries.
After Russia shot at American soldiers in Syria, our President violated federal law and the United States Constitution by illegally withholding aid to Ukraine, which was a benefit to Russia.
After Russia shot at American soldiers in Syria, our President agreed to withdraw troops from Germany, which was a benefit to Russia.
Russia benefits when Americans are unprepared to combat cyber warfare. Russia benefits when America creates a vacuum in Syria. Russia benefits when American soldiers are seen as for-profit mercenaries instead of defenders of democracy. Russia benefits from a US-Iran showdown. Russia benefits from a weakened Ukraine and destabilized Europe.
The President of the United States has committed multiple war crimes. He has committed multiple acts of treason.
I am formally calling on every Member of Congress to denounce the most recent behavior by the President.
This includes Senator Roy Blunt, Senator Josh Hawley, and Representative Vicky Hartzler, who must fulfill their Constitutional duty to hold the executive branch accountable for undermining the integrity and stability of these United States.
Can you help us by sending them an email below?
In solidarity,
Lindsey

937,"Good afternoon,
Last night, the volunteer team had a thoughtful discussion about ways to reach out to voters other than social media and phone calls. I agreed to provide some information, and I encourage all of you to use and share with your personal networks as you see fit. The following email and attachments contain background information on Michelle and the race, as well as print materials and video links.
BACKGROUND ON MAYOR DE LA ISLA
Michelle has served Kansas families her entire career, but her journey into public service was not easy. Michelle has overcome poverty, domestic violence, and cancer – all while taking care of her children as a single mother.
After graduating from Wichita State University, Michelle moved to Topeka and taught financial literacy, built homes with Habitat for Humanity, and participated in the Capital District Group that revitalized downtown Topeka. Michelle was elected to the Topeka City Council in 2013, and elected Mayor of Topeka in 2017. As mayor, Michelle has worked to create hundreds of jobs, increase funds to fix roads, open a new tech school, and reduce violent crime.
Mayor De La Isla has also received national attention for her leadership on how she has approached Covid-19 preparation and response in Topeka. Here is a link to a CNN feature about how she has stepped up during the crisis: Michelle on CNN.
Please also see the attached article, ""A Candidate on Our Watch List"" to learn more about Michelle's incredible story of overcoming hardship and her dedication to serving Kansas families.
THE RACE
We are extremely proud that we outraised our Republican opponents in both the 1st and 2nd Quarters of 2020. What's more - Democrats only lost this seat by only 2,239 votes in 2018 \- less than 1% of the vote! But - with the help of Democrats in Kansas and around the country, we know we can finally flip this seat and send a message that supporting Trump is not in the best interest of Americans. Period.
Mayor De La Isla has been endorsed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC),  EMILY's List, End Citizens United, the League of Conservation Voters, three former presidential candidates, the Kansas and National Education Association, and several labor unions - with certainly more to come. She was also recently added to the DCCC's Red to Blue Program, which means she is one of 30 races the nation believes has the chance to unseat an incumbent.

938,"Alex,
Unacceptable—those are my thoughts on this decision. Today, the Senate voted to acquit President Trump of the high crimes of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress—leaving a stain on the fabric of our country.
Last year, my colleagues and I in the US House of Representatives voted to formally impeach the President when it became clear he jeopardized our democracy and abused the power of the highest office for his own personal gain. The Senate decision sets a dangerous precedent for future leaders and their accountability, when they know partisan politics play a bigger role than protecting our democracy.
The House will continue to fight to administer the proper oversight over this Administration and preserve the strength of our Democracy.
Can I count on you to help us?

939,"Hi there,
I’m collecting signatures from Texas Democrats to demand William Barr resign as Attorney General.
The Attorney General is supposed to work on behalf of the American People.
But William Barr works solely to benefit Trump!
He’s one of the most crooked Attorney Generals we’ve ever had, so I need you to sign our petition to demand his resignation.
Click HERE to add your name >>
(I only need 18 more signatures from Houston)
Barr just intervened in the sentencing of one of Trump’s closest campaign strategists: Roger Stone.
Career prosecutors recommended that Stone go to jail for 7-9 years for crimes he committed during the 2016 Presidential Election.
But William Barr intervened after Trump tweeted about how “unfair” it was.
This isn’t a movie. This isn’t an autocracy. The Attorney General must have forgotten that this is the United States, and we respect justice.
If you agree that Americans deserve better than Trump crony William Barr, use the button below to submit your signature and demand his resignation:

* Republicans are FLOODING Devin Nunes with cash to crush our campaign!
In all honesty, their Republican mega-bucks could sink us. I won’t have the resources to compete without your help.

Devin Nunes is “Trump’s favorite Republican”.
He spreads deadly COVID conspiracy theories on Fox News. Spews lies about Vote-by-Mail. And always covers up Trump’s crimes and corruption!
Republicans LOVE it --- that’s why he has so much campaign cash.
But I know that we can take this seat back with your help.

I’m asking you for $5 to help me defeat Devin Nunes (Trump’s FAVORITE Congressman). Here’s why:
* Polls are SO CLOSE. And Devin barely won re-election in 2018.
* Trump is scared to death of our campaign. He knows we can really win.
* Republicans are FLOODING Devin Nunes with cash to crush our campaign!
In all honesty, their Republican mega-bucks could sink us. I won’t have the resources to compete without your help.
Can you split $5 between my campaign and the Progressive Turnout Project today? It will go directly toward defeating Devin Nunes and we’ll strike a HUGE blow against Trump in November →

Devin Nunes is “Trump’s favorite Republican”.
He spreads deadly COVID conspiracy theories on Fox News. Spews lies about Vote-by-Mail. And always covers up Trump’s crimes and corruption!
Republicans LOVE it --- that’s why he has so much campaign cash.
But I know that we can take this seat back with your help.

We’re up against a candidate whose record proves he’s not in this fight for the families of our community -- and we must fight back.
Troy Nehls is a former police officer with a long record of misconduct, from being discharged for mishandling evidence to lying about being charged with a crime in a sworn statement. He’s attacked survivors of sex trafficking and downplayed and denied the existence of coronavirus even as his own employeers got sick -- and he’s proven eager to become a mouthpiece of Washington special interests and gut health care for millions of families across this state.
Sri Preston Kulkarni is a lifelong public servant and diplomat who knows firsthand what it’s like to nearly go broke from our broken health care system. He’s in this fight to stand for working families in our district and expand access to affordable care, not gut it.
That’s the clear choice we’ll be facing in this election.

948,"Alex,
Instead of focusing on the task at hand and leading our nation through this time of uncertainty, our President would rather stoke flames of xenophobia and needlessly pass the blame onto others.
By using pejoratives like ""Chinese Virus"" or ""Wuhan Virus,"" the President is both ignoring the medically accurate label for COVID-19 and unfairly associating it with Chinese Americans. As a result of this stigma, many Asian Americans across the country have reported an uptick in physical and verbal harassment.
That’s why I, along with Congresswoman Judy Chu and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, penned a letter to President Trump condemning the anti-Asian rhetoric emanating from his office and the subsequent discrimination and violence it has encouraged.
Rhetoric like the President and his cabinet officials are using have serious consequences for the safety and well-being of Asian-Americans across the country. The CDC specifically recommends against associating a disease with a region or ethnicity because of the danger it poses.
This xenophobic language only serves as a distraction to the mission at hand \-- to practice social distancing, relieve our health care system, and flatten the curve so we can save lives and begin to return back to normal.
Folks around the country have enough hardships to grapple with during this pandemic -- from health concerns to food insecurity to loss of income and so much more. It’s cruel to cause even more trauma in the Asian American community by continuing to promote this ugly, misleading, and dangerous stigma.
I will continue fighting alongside my fellow advocates in Congress to denounce hatred and bigotry, reduce hate crimes and ensure they are being properly investigated, and protect the most vulnerable in our community.
Thank you,
Congressman Al Green

RONNY JACKSON RELEASES NEW AD - ""BATTLEFIELDS""
Amarillo, TX – Today, Dr. Ronny Jackson, President Trump's former White House Physician, Senior Advisor and Retired Navy Rear Admiral, released a new campaign ad titled ""Battlefields"". In the ad, Jackson details how DC Democrats and the liberal media sabotaged his character and service to his country during Ronny's VA nomination in order to try and tear down President Trump. In Congress, Ronny Jackson will be one of President Trump's staunchest allies, and will be the only freshman Congressman who, on day one, can walk into the Oval Office unannounced and produce immediate results for the people of the 13th district.
Said Jackson: ""During my entire 25 years of Active Duty service to my country, not a single person has ever questioned my character, commitment or integrity. It wasn't until President Trump appointed me as a senior member of his team that things began to change. The Democrats and the liberal media are consumed with so much hatred towards our President that they will say and do ANYTHING in an effort to tear him down - even if that means using lies and false accusations in an attempt to ruin someone's life and reputation in the process. We saw them do the same thing with Justice Kavanaugh. I like to say, I was Kavanaughed before Kavanaugh - I was the pregame. Since when did it become a crime to support OUR President? I will never apologize for supporting President Trump. I am honored to have served alongside him and honored to be his endorsed candidate in this race. He has given me his complete and total endorsement and he has asked the voters in this district to vote for me because he needs me in Congress to help him with his Keep America Great and America First Agenda.""

The liberal Left used lies against Ronny Jackson to attack President Trump. Now, Anti-Trump lobbyist and Democrat donor Josh Winegarner is using those same liberal lies to help his friends in the Swamp.

## COUNTDOWN TO RUNOFF ELECTION DAY: 56 DAYS
Hi Alex! This week, Ronny made the liberal media's heads EXPLODE by, of all things, defending President Trump! Since when did it become such a crime to support the President of the United States? Democrats have become so UNHINGED that they are now dismissing OFFICIAL government reports by the Acting Director of National Intelligence because they think it hurts Joe Biden's chances of winning in November. Want to know why Ronny is the staunch Texas conservative we need in Congress? Liberals from California are now trying to stop Ronny from winning! Click HERE to see for yourself!
Simply put, Ronny will NEVER shy away from making a tough decision even if it means opening himself up to criticism. Ronny is going to do what's RIGHT for the people of TX-13. Period. End of story. Plus, as a retired Navy Rear Admiral who has been deployed to some of the most violently contested regions of Iraq and Afghanistan, Ronny has been involved in much bigger conflicts than some mean-spirited tweets from Kathy Griffin.

952,"Thank you for your interest in staying up to date with this campaign! This is not an ordinary election year. We face a real and present danger to our Republic, in the form of a President who welcomes Russian interference in our elections, who has been caught red-handed cheating to win in 2020, and who conceals these high crimes with a blizzard of lies that continue to deceive millions of Americans.
I am running to raise my voice against that danger. We must succeed, first because we cherish our democracy, and also because that victory is vital for meeting the other policy challenges we face—from climate change to health care, from reducing gun violence to making billionaires pay their fair share of taxes, from a humane immigration policy to affordable higher education.
It is essential that we resume progress toward meeting the numerous critical challenges we face, and I look forward to presenting my ideas on how I will represent Colorado in a 2021 Democratic majority Senate. That Senate will shift from threatening our democracy toward restoring it, from fueling bitter national divisions toward healing them, from denying the global threat posed by climate change to addressing it, from trying to deny health insurance to people with pre-existing conditions to ensuring health care for all.
But for that to take place, we must raise our voices to defend this 230 year-old Republic. For Coloradans, that means letting Cory Gardner know that he has failed to put state and country above Party affiliation. Vote this election and flip Colorado’s U.S. Senate seat. Help to restore a Democratic majority, driven by democratic values. Defend our democracy and ensure that your interests are represented in the Senate. Please consider voting for David Goldfischer.

Gazette: Send Lauren Boebert, a young impassioned leader, to Congress
The Gazette Editorial Board
Oct 12, 2020
If Lauren Boebert lands a job in Congress Nov. 3, she will improve the brand of the Republican Party.
A 33-year-old wife, mother of four and owner of a highly unique business, Boebert drew media intrigue even before she shocked the political establishment by defeating five-term Republican Rep. Scott Tipton in the primary. In addition to movie star looks, she exudes passion for freedom, capitalism and the United States that makes the socialist, anti-America sentiment of AOC + three look gloomy and sad.
In the big league of Congress, she could lead a national, youthful, patriotic, pro-capitalist movement to rival the fashionable narrative that tells young Americans their country is evil.
While left-wing feminist leaders cast women as victims, Boebert looms large as a 100-pound symbol of female empowerment. Women can start with nothing and have big families, provide for them, and defend them.
She founded and owns the iconic Shooters Grill in Rifle. After a man was beaten to death outside the restaurant, Boebert wondered how she and other women would protect themselves from similar crimes. She decided to train with a handgun and wear it on her hip. Soon, nearly all her female employees followed suit.
In a meeting with The Gazette’s editorial board, Boebert exuded an unequivocal devotion to freedom, free markets, compassion for others, and the joy of discovering self-sufficiency.
“I learned in that moment that if I take a stand and speak for what I believe is right I can affect and represent millions,” Boebert said. “That moment” was Boebert arriving, after a three-hour drive, at a campaign rally by then-presidential candidate Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke in Aurora. O’Rourke, a Democrat, had promised to confiscate rifles if elected president.
“I was in the right place at the right time, so I grabbed the microphone with my Glock on my hip,” she recalls. “I looked him in the eyes and I told him ‘Hell no you are not.’ I didn’t see anyone standing for freedom, but I saw a whole lot of people willing to give our freedom away.”
The woman left speechless a powerful, rich, white-male darling-of-the-media. The confrontation went viral, and Boebert became a routine guest on cable news. President Donald Trump, who had supported Tipton, publicly and privately congratulated her after the primary and invited her to the White House.
Boebert’s belief in capitalism, freedom and the old-fashioned American way developed after a childhood of poverty, welfare, and all assortment of government assistance. Boebert moved with her family to Rifle as a teenager. There, she landed a job at McDonald’s and discovered the thrill of money that was earned.
“I’m so thankful for the owners who invested in me,” Boebert said. “I can still remember walking up the steps of our home and bringing mom home that first paycheck. I remember the pride and the empowerment that was connected to it and the sense of personal responsibility that began to develop.”
Later, as a young adult, she volunteered to visit with women at the Garfield County Jail. She told them upon release they could move past old mistakes and misdeeds and control their destinies by creating wealth for themselves.
Boebert abhors socialism, viewing it as an oppressor of the poor and otherwise disadvantaged. She bases her platform on a traditional interpretation of the Constitution and advocates policies designed to facilitate and assist with success for anyone who wants it. She defends the extraction of clean natural gas by a fracking industry under attack by left-wing activists in Denver and Boulder.
Boebert’s Democratic opponent, Diane Mitsch Bush, represents the antithesis of western, rural Colorado values. A retired sociology professor and far-left Democrat, Mitsch Bush has supported nearly every regulatory attack on oil, gas and coal producers who provide high-wage jobs and tax revenues throughout her district. Organizations hostile to the Second Amendment have endorsed Mitsch Bush in past campaigns.
Her endorsements are a who’s who of left-wing organizations, including Planned Parenthood, the AFL-CIO and an assortment of other unions including Unite Here! — a group with such extreme demands it threatens the survival of resorts and hotels throughout District 3 and the rest of Colorado.
Mitsch Bush would begin her congressional career one-month shy of turning 71. By no fault of her own, she would approach her 80s before acquiring the committee assignments and level of seniority Colorado needs to improve a relatively weak delegation in Congress.
Entering Congress at age 34, colleagues would view Boebert as a force of the near future to invest in today. She would likely get coveted committee assignments while standing out nationally as an energetic new symbol of what people can do in a country that stands for justice, prosperity, personal empowerment, and freedom for all above all.
Vote for Lauren Boebert and empower the kind of inspiring, high-quality candidate that seldom comes along.

Friend,
Eight minutes and 46 seconds: That’s how long a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on George Floyd’s neck. George gasped “I can’t breathe” and eventually became unresponsive. This cruel, cold-blooded murder has been witnessed by millions and has since sparked a groundswell of action as protesters across the country march for an end to racial injustice.
It isn’t enough to demand that the officers involved in George Floyd’s killing be held accountable for their crimes. We must work to dismantle the racist systems that led to George’s death, and the deaths of so many other Black Americans for generations. Institutional racism has also resulted in discrimination against Black Americans in countless forms, including in healthcare, in our workplaces, in our schools, and at the voting booth.
As your Representative, I pledge to do my part -- I’ll continue to learn, to fight for laws and policies that will make our communities safer and more just for all Americans, and to hold this Administration accountable. But here’s what I’m asking from you: Don’t remain silent. Speak out, or use your platform to elevate others. And if you have the means, please consider donating to organizations like the NAACP.
This is our chance to stand united and push for impactful, lasting change in our communities. So in George Floyd’s memory, I hope you’ll join me in fighting for a more hopeful, more just future.
Thank you,
Ted

Friend,
On Wednesday, 52 Republican United States Senators voted to acquit the President on both articles of impeachment brought forth by the House of Representatives. Disturbingly, many conceded the points argued by my colleagues -- that Donald Trump did pressure the Ukrainians to interfere in our elections -- but they concluded that even this most profound subversion of our Democracy wasn’t enough to warrant his removal.
These Senators had a job to do: They had a responsibility to hold Trump accountable for his crimes and to demonstrate that no one, not even the President of the United States, is above the law. They were too afraid to do their duty -- and we can’t ever let them forget it.
Whoever heard of a trial with no witnesses or documents? Will you add your name today to show that the American people strongly condemn the GOP’s fake impeachment trial and their decision to acquit the President?
Best,
Ted

Friend,
Around this time last month, I was still holding out hope that Republican members of Congress might find the strength and the moral courage to hold Trump accountable for his crimes.
And then Devin Nunes threatened to sue me for telling the truth about his role in Trump's Ukraine extortion scheme. So, that was short-lived.
Now, as January comes to an end, my colleagues across the aisle are blindly defending the indefensible \-- and they need to know there will be consequences for their complicity come November.
But why wait until then? In a little over a month, I’ll be on the ballot in the California primaries. We could send a strong message to Trump’s enablers in Congress (looking at you, Devin Nunes) by closing out this month with a $5,000 fundraising surge to help us win big at the polls.
So will you contribute $500, $250, $100, or whatever you can before midnight on Friday to show the GOP that we aren’t afraid -- not now, and not on Election Day -- to make our voices heard?
Best,
Ted

Friend,
It’s almost Superbowl Sunday, which means another year has come and gone without my Cleveland Browns making it to the postseason \-- yes, I’m jealous of all the Chiefs and 49ers fans out there.
But imagine this: One team plays by the book -- observing all of the rules, abiding by the referee’s calls -- while the other team gets away without playing by any rules at all. Would we question the outcome of that game, or just move on?
Well, look no further than Congress, where Republicans have decided that the rules simply don’t apply to them or to Donald Trump. My colleagues make a show of being completely biased, even though they all swore an oath of impartiality; they’ve refused to consider key evidence, despite their moral and legal imperative to do so; and they’ve made it clear that there’s no crime that Donald Trump could commit that would warrant his removal from office.
But we can’t move on. We need the GOP to know that all eyes are on them -- and that the people are ready to vote them out. So will you rush in a donation before midnight tonight to help us hit our end-of-month goal and turn their game into a blowout?
Best,
Ted

Nancy Pelosi and the do-nothing Democrats will do anything to remove my father from office.
They have rigged this entire impeachment process from the start:
* They held meetings in secret
* They selectively leaked information to damage the President
* They denied basic due process
Defend President Trump
Let’s be clear: House Democrats have set a dangerous precedent. For the first time in history, Articles of Impeachment have been delivered to the Senate which do not allege a single crime was committed or law was violated. This is a complete sham — my father is innocent and the American people know it.
Together we must fight back! Stand with President Trump against impeachment. >>>
Let’s keep America Great and reelect my father! I need your support, Alex.
Thank you,

Fellow Conservative,
How safe would you feel if your right to self-defense was eroded? If you were thrown in jail for defending your family during a car-jacking or a home invasion.
While Democratic cities are crippling our first responders and allowing violent crime to soar, Democrats in our district have gone even further to make our most vulnerable even less safe.
That’s right, a Democrat running for Congress in the First District has proposed a TOTAL REPEAL of “Stand Your Ground” laws.
STAND UP FOR STAND YOUR GROUND
If you don’t know what these laws are, you’re lucky. These protections are the only thing protecting gun owners from possible imprisonment and legal liability for defending themselves and others.
Criminalizing self-defense and gutting personal protections flies in the face of the spirit of the Constitution and the rights of the American people.
I want to take this opportunity to swear to the people of Michigan that I will always protect your right to defend your family, yourselves, and your property.
Do you stand with me? Take this poll and let us know if you support “Stand Your Ground” protections.
Your servant,
Jack

960,"Fellow Conservative,
This year has shown Michiganders what our priorities are. Our family, our freedom, and our financial security have become more precious to us than ever. They have also been threatened like never before.
Before you vote this November, ask yourself who you trust on these four fundamental issues:
* Who do you trust with your job security and getting the economy back on track?
* Who do you trust to fight for the safety and security of your families?
* Who do you trust to uphold First Amendment rights to free speech and free expression for ALL Americans?
* Who do you trust to love this nation and fix it—rather than dismantle and destroy it?
In any other election, that would be a debate. Not any longer. That is what’s at stake.
We’ve seen the Democratic vision for America these past months. Violent crime running rampant, censorship and cancel culture, and economic devastation across the country. We cannot let that be our future. We cannot give the mob a mandate this November.
TAKE ACTION!
We will recover from this as a stronger nation, but we need Republican leadership to make that possible.
We want to make sure that boarded up small businesses in Michigan represent a solemn reminder of our resilience, and not a vision of our future.
As your Representatives, we know that Republicans win on the economy every time. We win on keeping your families safe, championing free speech, and putting your money where it belongs: back in your pocket.
CHOOSE AMERICAN PROSPERITY!
We believe that this American comeback will make us stronger than ever. We want to lead a Michigan where ALL people can enjoy the prosperity of American principles and the American Dream.
Help us win in November!
We’re Fighting For You,
Michigan Republican Congressional Delegation

961,"Democrats continue pushing their agenda.
The House of Representatives, on Thursday, passed its updated version of the HEROES Act. The cost is now “only” $2.2 Trillion. Even some Democrats were unwilling to vote in favor of it because they knew the bill was not going anywhere in the Senate. Democrat Rep. Abigail Spanberger said, “The American people are exhausted by empty promises and government dysfunction.” In fact, it wasn’t long ago that our current Rubber Stamp Representative voiced her opinion that voting on bills that were not going to be taken up in the Senate was a waste of time, and yet she voted in favor of this bill anyway.
If you dive down deeper into the HEROES Act, the Washington Post points out, the main reason the updated version costs less money revolves around the idea that they have reduced the amount of time the bill would be in effect. Does this mean they will be asking for more money in a couple of months, then again in a couple more months? It does not seem too bad when you ask for a large amount of money once, but then if you keep coming back and asking for more, then these bills become very costly to the American people. It is the slow boiling frog scenario. First it was the CARES Act with $3 Trillion, now it is the HEROES Act with $2.2 Trillion. When does it stop?
No photo description available.
Even though the Democrats have disguised the bill using shorter time constraints, it still contains items unrelated to the Coronavirus. The HEROES Act still contains bailouts for cities that have mismanaged their budgets for decades and are using the Coronavirus as an excuse. As a businessman, I understand what it takes to handle budgets. When revenues are down you make adjustments, trim edges, and cut back on expenses to meet the revenue projections. Throwing money to fix bad budgets rarely fixes things, but that is the Democrat montra.
Another issue I have with the updated version of the HEROES Act is the fact they cut out $600 million in police grant funding that was in the original HEROES Act. This comes just days after Democrats accused the President of threatening to take grant funding away from anarchist cities. So the President isn’t allowed to take grant funding away from the anarchist cities, but the House can take police grant funding out of the original HEROES Act to fit their agenda to defund the police and pander to the radical left? There is already lawlessness that has led to the destruction of our small businesses and affecting the safety of our communities and the updated HEROES Act would only exacerbate the situation. This idea of having less police will lessen violence and crime is proving itself to be the wrong step. Police are the first line of defense for safe communities. In fact, many of the minorities in inner cities have pleaded for their Democrat leadership not to defund the police. They know that crime will go up and their communities will be less safe. The last thing we should be doing is defunding the police.
Image may contain: text that says 'DEFEND THE FUND POLIO POLICE'
One last thing that the Democrats aren’t giving up on is the $600/week of unemployment benefits. The Democrats are still in denial that if you pay someone more to sit at home, they are not going to go back to work. Or, maybe that is their plan. They want the public to rely on the government to provide for their needs so the government can control the people. This continues to sound more and more like Venezuela. We know how that ended. I believe the President struck the right chord when he lowered it to $400/week, a good compromise.
Let’s remember, the Senate has already drafted a bill that will “only” cost $1.6 trillion, and yet the House is unwilling to accept $1.6 trillion because they don’t believe it will do enough. We are $27 Trillion in debt at this time. This year alone, we are $4 Trillion over budget. How are we going to pay all of this off? When do we hold Congress responsible? We cannot spend our way out of this.
If we had only planned for a future pandemic that we knew someday would happen, maybe we wouldn’t be in such dire straits. That is the type of leadership I would like to take to D.C.; one that plans for America’s future, not responds only when a crisis occurs.
I Need Your Help!
To help combat the liberal leaning message controlling media, we are seeking people that are willing to write to the editor of their local newspaper. Each week, it would be great if supporters would please write about why you think I would be a better Representative than the incumbent. This is the only way to get out our message in a controlled left leaning media environment. We need help in Mill Creek, Lake Stevens, Snohomish and Monroe to name a few. We also need volunteers to help get out my message and educate them about me.

# 4 Days Left!
Dear Conservative,
It’s Leon Benjamin. I am a black pastor and the Republican nominee in Virginia’s 4th District!
What we are seeing in Kenosha, WI is horrifying. It’s what we have seen in Richmond, VA every night for over three months.
BLM and Antifa terrorists have put the entire town to the torch. Dozens of buildings burned down, hundreds of stores looted, and dozens of innocent bystanders hunted down for the crime of being white.
KENOSHA RIOTING
KENOSHA RIOTING 2
This is what Leftist America looks like.
It should scare you. It scares me.
That is why I am fighting against it!
The Leftist mobs have run across this country spreading chaos and violence for long enough! My opponent Socialist Donald McEachin outright supports these Marxists who are burning down this country!
Please donate $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, $1,000, or more to my campaign and help me fight back against this anti-American assault on our country and our way of life!

We are fast approaching our end of the month fundraising goal—and we’re still short!

# 88 Days Until Victory on November 3rd!
Dear Friends of Leon Benjamin!,
My name is Leon Benjamin and I am running for Congress in Virginia’s 4th District. I am a black conservative pastor, a spokesman for President Trump, a Navy combat veteran, and a staunch defender of our conservative values.
I am running against Socialist Donald McEachin, a Leftist Extremist who refuses to CONDEMN rampant violence and domestic terrorism in America!
Please donate GENEROUSLY today, to restore American Conservative values to Washington!
We MUST raise our voices!
“Civilians exercising their constitutional rights?!”
I’m not sure what Constitution Socialist McEachin is reading, but it’s sure not ours!
Let me be clear. We have a Constitutional Right to protest, but we do not have a Constitutional Right to do the following:
-Murder innocent civilians in the streets who dare say “All Lives Matter!”
-Barricade innocents inside of federal buildings and attempt to burn them alive like Radical Leftists did in Portland, Oregon!
-Create “Autonomous Zones” where crime is spiking because police in many cases are not allowed to interfere!
Socialist McEachin and his gang of cronies are not only defending domestic terrorists but capitalizing on the recent death of Representative John Lewis to do it!
Is this “good trouble?!”
Socialist McEachin and the Silent Left will not CONDEMN these violent acts of domestic terrorism, and they MUST BE STOPPED!
Will you help me?
Please donate $10, $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, $1,000, or more today and help me stop these Leftist tyrants!
Thank you for all of your support!

# Primary Season is Over in the 4th!
### Help Me Reach My End of The Month Goal!
Dear Patriot,
If you haven’t gotten my messages, I’m Leon Benjamin—a black conservative pastor, veteran, a surrogate for President Trump, and I’m an unapologetic Conservative!
I am running against Socialist gun-grabber Donald McEachin, who stands alongside Racist Joe Biden, in Virginia’s 4th District!
We have an urgent fundraising deadline less than a week away!
At the end of the month, the fundraising quarter will end and we need to give a strong showing to demonstrate our legitimacy as a campaign!
Will you help me hit my goal?
Please donate today and help me get over the line!
*YES, I WILL HELP YOU MEET YOUR GOAL*
I was born and raised in district in Richmond, Virginia.
Richmond has always been my home and its where I am raising my two wonderful kids with my wife of 28 years, Maria.
When our country went to war in the Persian Gulf War, my country needed me. As a Navy reservist, I was deployed to fight for freedom. I served on the USS John F. Kennedy.
Many brave men and women put their lives on the line beside me in service to our country. Our freedom was won by the blood of patriots.
Freedom is never free.
After I got home, the Lord called me into the ministry.
I’ve pastored a church here in Richmond for more than a decade. God has called me to serve the people of Richmond.
I’ve also had the honor of representing the President as a minority surrogate, arguing for the President’s agenda on Fox News and other cable news outlets.
I’ve always been a strong supporter of the President!
Socialist McEachin is nothing but a rabid anti-Trumper trying to undermine him at all costs! He doesn’t care about his district.
I’ve watched as Democrats take the black vote for granted and time and time again pass over our inner-city communities. The only time they remotely care is when it’s election time.
Black lives don’t matter to them. Black votes matter.
That’s all I am to Racist Joe Biden.
That’s why God called me to run for Congress! We need true conservative leadership in Washington!
We need someone who will fight for OUR values!
Will you help me beat Socialist McEachin?
Please donate today to my campaign and help me stop Socialism!
*STOP SOCIALISM!*
This country is burning as Socialists are attempting a full-scale insurrection! And Socialists like McEachin are fanning the flames!
In Seattle, Leftist terrorists occupied six city blocks and declared they seceded from the United States to establish their own communist state!
The Leftist mayor of Seattle turned tail and ran! She ordered police to stand down and let them have the precinct! Now, they’ve erected walls!
They built a wall, are violently enforcing border security, screening everyone coming in and out with ID checks, and have armed guards with AR-15s and AK-47s patrolling the wall!
These same communists were screaming racist because Trump wanted a strong border with Mexico—and they’ve gone and done the same thing.
These Leftists are also terrorizing their own people. They are exhorting businesses, beating anyone up that doesn’t agree with them, and are violently enforcing their own laws:
The official also added that leaders in the anti-cop zone are ""starting to extort money from the local businesses within the border for 'protection.'""
Rapper Raz Simone also declared himself warlord. This is a full-scale Marxist dystopia ruled by a violent warlord and armed guards!
Now, crimes are being committed left and right in the autonomous zone and the police have not been allowed access inside to get to these calls:
“Our calls for service have more than tripled,” she told reporters. “These are responses to emergency calls — rapes, robberies, and all sorts of violent acts that have been occurring in the area that we’re not able to get to.”
There have been two shootings in the last 48 hours alone in the autonomous zone! This is what the world looks like without cops!
We need our police and this Leftist scum are trying to completely abolish them!
I will stand with President Trump for our law enforcement and against this insanity!
Will you help me?
Please donate today and send a conservative warrior that will always Back the Blue!
*BACK THE BLUE!*
Now, other cities are trying to overthrow our police and spread this Socialist insurrection!
In Washington DC, protestors tried to form an autonomous zone and pull down a statue of Andrew Jackson!
In my native Richmond, the Lee statue has become a hotspot of armed, violent protestors to gather! They’ve started trying to make barricades with cars around the statues!
This is just disgusting and needs to be stopped immediately!
Governor Blackface Northam has YET to address this! He and Socialist McEachin are looking the other way at this sickening violence and just pretending it isn’t happening!
They don’t care about black lives. Dozens of black police officers have been killed and wounded across America by leftist terrorists and anarchists! Not a single Democrat said a word.
Hundreds of black men and women have been shot in the last few weeks in Chicago and Baltimore. Not a single word of condemnation.
Here in Richmond, our black community is victimized by drug and gang violence. And the entire police force has to fight a bunch of rioters every night as black men and women die!
These Socialist Democrats don’t care about black lives: all they care about are black votes. They are fanning the flames of violence and watching America burn to the ground—all so they can win an election!
This is disgusting and evil!
Our Richmond police headquarters was attacked by an armed gang that threw bombs, bottles, and bricks at police! They attempted to burn down the HQ. Luckily, our police stood their ground.
Meanwhile, our Leftist mayor had his apartment complex broken into by a crowd of protestors! And he had an army of private security to force them out!
What a disgusting hypocrite! He wants to disarm us, take away all police, and hires private security?!
It’s time to kick these hypocrites out of office!
Help me take back this district from Socialist McEachin! Donate today and help me win!
STOP SOCIALISM!*
The end of the fundraising quarter is at the end of month! We have less than a week to hit our fundraising goal!
We are trying to raise $30,000 dollars! So far, we’ve raised $27,563!
We’re so close! Can you help push us over the edge?

Friends,
Enough is enough.
We need to all stand-up and speak out together against hate with shared values of peoplehood because defeating hate in all of its forms requires all of us to do it together. Will you help me fight for equity and justice in the 4th district?
Our society and the very fabric on which it rests is in need of repair. The poisonous phenomenon of hatred, racism, and Anti-Semitism did not happen overnight. We are living in a time when people of many different faiths and backgrounds are afraid, are hurt, and are feeling alone.
I am the only candidate in this race who has made combating hatred, bigotry, racism, Islamophobia and Anti-Semitism a top priority from the beginning of the campaign because I know our community is stronger when we are all safe, supported and united.
During these times we need a leader that has bold ideas, someone who is consistent in speaking out against injustice and someone who is a unifier, bridge builder and connector who doesn’t just talk about diversity because it is convenient, but who actually advances diversity, equity and inclusion. To help move our community forward - I proudly released comprehensive roadmaps to combating and eliminating racism and Anti-Semitism this week.
My Roadmap to Eliminating Systemic Racism calls for:
1. Reforming our police policies to end the unjust treatment of our black and brown community;
2. Eradicating the systemic racism in our healthcare, housing, education, transportation, and criminal justice systems and in our environment, and;
3. Attacking the underlying causes of racism through education, protecting voting rights, encouraging completion of the census questionnaires, and electing and supporting diverse leaders like myself who understand the diverse perspectives of the community.
My Roadmap to Combating Anti-Semitism calls for:
1. Promoting more community building and fostering collaborative relationships between diverse ethnic, cultural and religious groups;
2. Passing tougher hate crimes legislation and enforcing them;
3. Advocating for the adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) Working Definition of Antisemitism;
4. Passing the NO HATE Act;
5. Providing additional security aid to protect our cultural and religious institutions; and
6. Enhancing our intelligence gathering.
Please join my campaign as we fight against hatred in all its forms against all people, because hate against any one group is hate against every group.

As a Pennsylvanian and former Congressman, I can attest that Jim Bognet is the right man at the right time for the good people of our state. My friend, Jim, is running for Pennsylvania’s 8th Congressional District so we can be represented by someone with our Northeast Pennsylvania values. Losing is not an option.

I need your help in flipping Pennsylvania’s 8th Congressional seat red.
Our current Congressman, Nancy Pelosi’s lapdog, Matt Cartwright, has taken every opportunity to encourage the Radical Left \-- even going as far to say he’s in favor of defunding the police.
The liberals have already announced that they’re targeting swing states like Pennsylvania to make sure they keep their majority in the House of Representatives.
If we don’t fight back now and get rid of Matt Cartwright, the Radical Left will defund the police nationwide and bring the crime and riots to every small-town American city.

Dear friends,
People across our nation are hurting. After the brutal killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis (adding to the long list of other Black Americans who have been unjustly murdered), millions of Americans have united in protest. They are taking to the streets and demanding accountability and real change to our society and our laws. Over the past few weeks, I've marched in Middletown and Wilmington and met with community leaders throughout our state; but most importantly, I've spent time listening to the thousands of Delawareans who have spoken out about the changes they want to see.
That's why I signed on to the Justice in Policing Act, as an original co-sponsor. This historic bill, first introduced by Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, is an important start to creating the change so many are demanding.
The Justice in Policing Act would finally designate lynching a federal hate crime and make it easier for the federal government to prosecute police misconduct. The bill also mandates racial bias training and makes many more important reforms that are long overdue.
But we're going to need your help to get this legislation passed in the Senate. Sign our petition to demand Mitch McConnell hold a vote on comprehensive policing reform today →
ADD YOUR NAME
This is an urgent moment for our nation. What we do in the next five months will change the direction of our country for years to come. This legislation isn't perfect and one law alone cannot end systemic racism, but it sends an important signal that we intend to begin this necessary work right now.
For too long, our country has not valued the lives of Black Americans, and simply saying Black Lives Matter is not enough. We must implement policies that actually address the injustices Black Americans face every day, and this bill is an important step in that direction.
The stakes could not be higher. But, as my friend Joe Biden says of the American people, ""There's never been anything we've been unable to do, when we set our mind to do it and we do it together."" I agree, and I believe we can come together to make the changes we need.
Please, sign our petition now and demand Mitch McConnell hold a vote on this crucial reform package!
Thank you all,
Chris

Andrew Garbarino is running for Congress to protect Long Island from the growing socialist threat.
Chip in now to help Andrew reach his CRUCIAL July End Of Month Fundraising Goal >>
Garbarino for Congress
Alex, I’m reaching out to you today because the LEFT is heavily TARGETING Long Island. Democrats have already poured MILLIONS in this race to prop up my opponent, Jackie Gordon. The Democrats have one goal in mind: turn the remaining Republican districts in New York into socialist strongholds to eventually put more AOC type politicians into power and push socialism in every community.
But with your help, I’m not going to let that happen.
Long Island has always been my home.
I am proud of my family’s deep roots on Long Island that stretch from Bay Shore to Patchogue. My family has profoundly invested in our fantastic community for decades:
Andrew Garbarino
* My grandfather and great uncle owned local grocery stores.
* My uncle operates our local deli.
* My father runs a small law firm in Sayville, NY.
At a young age, my family instilled in me a profound respect for Long Island and a strong passion for giving back to our community. That same passion to serve my community is the fuel that drives my campaign to be the next Congressman of New York’s 2nd Congressional District!
Congressman Peter King and Andrew Garbarino
Aside from my desire to serve my community, I’m also a proven fighter. As the representative of the South Shore in Albany, I have FOUGHT EVERY DAY against the Democrats’ socialist policies of dangerous bail-reform laws, allowing MS-13 to roam our streets freely, and now the “Defund the Police” movement.
That’s why if I’m elected the next Congressman of Long Island, I will faithfully represent our community and always put the needs of its people FIRST!
I’ve always worked to protect our greatest resource, the Great South Bay, and like my friends, Congressman Steve Scalise & Pete King, I'll do my part to drain the swamp and fight for conservative values.
It’s truly a disgrace what the Democrats have done to the State of New York. New York City and Long Island’s success is due to the entrepreneurial spirit, hard work, and grit of the people of this state and, these are the very ideals Democrats wish to destroy and replace with socialism. All while politicians like Jackie Gordon will stay silent and watch as it happens.
Andrew Garbarino
That’s why I’m so disgusted when I see what’s happening in New York City; violent crime is increasing, the NYPD is being attacked in broad daylight, and the looting and arson is happening without consequence.
Meanwhile, Jackie Gordon refuses to speak up in support of law and order and condemn this violence, fearing she might lose the support of the socialists in her party. At the end of the day, Jackie Gordon doesn’t care about Long Island. She only cares, first and foremost, about getting elected and following Nancy Pelosi’s agenda. That’s why I’m writing to you today.
Alex, will you chip in $5, $25, or $50 to protect our home of Long Island from the growing Socialist threat and help me reach my End of Month goal?
I go to battle for the people of New York every day, and I will bring that same FIRE and TENACITY to this race and all of the radical Democrats in Congress. But I’m going to need your help to get there!
Support my fight for Long Island and help me defeat Jackie Gordon on November 3rd!

Garbarino for Congress
Alex,
I wanted to take a moment to talk to you about a growing threat to my home of Long Island. Long Island has always been a refuge for liberty and conservative ideals in an otherwise liberal New York, but our future is being threatened.
After years of radical policies enacted by Democrats at both the state and local level, our backyard of New York City has fallen into a state of CHAOS and VIOLENCE. Even worse, my liberal opponent, Jackie Gordon, remains silent amidst this destruction!
New York City has been the testing ground for the Left’s SOCIALIST PLAN! An agenda that is now spreading to the rest of the country. Riots are happening in almost EVERY MAJOR CITY around the country!
Bring Law & Order Back to Our Cities
While Jackie Gordon likes to pretend she’s a moderate, her record would say different. She holds most of the same policies as AOC, and she was even endorsed by a far-left member of the Squad, AYANNA PRESSLEY!
Law & Order
If that’s not bad enough, she would be a rubber stamp for Nancy Pelosi and AOC’s plan to DEFUND OUR POLICE at a time when violent crime has RISEN EXPONENTIALLY in NYC. According to the NYPD, during July 2020 in New York alone...
There was a +177% increase in the number of shootings.
The number of murders increased by +59%.
A +286% increase in robberies from this time last year.
The number of auto thefts increased by +53%.
Bring Law & Order Back to Our Cities
Why does Jackie Gordon refuse to condemn this violence?
Perhaps it’s because she is afraid to condemn the radicals in her own party or worse, she actually sides with the LEFTIST MOBS and CRIMINALS, over the law-abiding citizens of New York and the NYPD.
Law & Order
Democrats, like Jackie Gordon, want to recreate this socialist nightmare on a national level in every city, town, and community around this country!
Alex, Long Island is only a couple of miles away from New York City, that’s why I’m reaching out to you! We can’t let this radical socialism spread to Long Island. Unlike Jackie Gordon, I want to protect Long Island and ensure it remains a place of LAW and ORDER, not mob violence! But I’m going to need your help!
Will you consider chipping in $5, $10, or even $25 to defeat Jackie Gordon and BRING LAW & ORDER BACK to our cities?
Chip in $5 to Bring Law & Order Back to Our Cities!
Chip in $10 to Bring Law & Order Back to Our Cities!
Chip in $25 to Bring Law & Order Back to Our Cities!
Chip in $50 to Bring Law & Order Back to Our Cities!
Chip in $100 to Bring Law & Order Back to Our Cities!
If my radical opponent gets elected, the Democrats will double down on this unrest and violence! Don’t let Long Island fall to socialism the same way New York City has!
Take A Stand Now and Help Me Bring Back Law and Order to our Cities! >>

979,"That hasn't stopped President Trump from flagrantly disregarding the Hatch Act.
Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend, we already knew that Donald Trump feels that he’s above the law. He’s demonstrated it time and again.
Last week, he continued the pattern during the Republican National Convention, turning the White House into a cheap prop for his re-election campaign.
Picture of the White House lawn during the RNC with Trump reelection propaganda.
It wasn’t just the President. He’s packed his administration with others who believe they’re above the law:
* Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a convention speech from Jerusalem, where he was traveling on the taxpayer’s dime.
* First Lady Melania Trump addressed the Republican National Convention from the Rose Garden.
* Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf staged an official naturalization ceremony as part of the televised convention.
There’s a reason why neither party has ever used the White House as the backdrop for their convention: it’s against the law.
A 1939 law called the Hatch Act made it a crime for government employees to do political work at taxpayer expense, and it bars the President from ordering federal workers to engage in political activity like, for example, throwing a political convention on the White House lawn.
It’s disgraceful, friend. With Senate Republicans enabling his lawless behavior, it’s clear the President believes he is above the law.
We need to send a message that laws and ethics still matter. To do that, we need to run this lawless President and his enablers out of town and flip the Senate blue. That starts with re-electing Mark Warner. Can you pitch in to Mark’s campaign and help us send a strong message on Election Day?

Alex,
There’s something going on in big cities across the country that liberals don’t want to talk about – but I’m not afraid to state the facts.
Crime rates are skyrocketing as Democrat-run cities turn their backs on law enforcement, and communities are paying the price for their terrible leadership!
Democrats have abandoned criminal justice in their crusade for social justice, and this is just a preview of what will happen if they take over America on November 3rd.
Friend, we MUST stop the Democrats before it’s too late. With just 97 days to go until we cast our votes, will you chip in to my campaign today to defend the future of law & order in America?

We can’t afford to lose our freedoms, and I’ll do whatever it takes to defend them in Washington just like I did when I was in the Marine Corps.

Federal election law requires political committees to use best efforts to report the name, mailing address, occupation, and name of employer of individuals whose contributions exceed $200 during an election cycle. An individual may not contribute more than a total of $2,800 (maximum for Primary Election) per election to the committee. Federal law prohibits contributions to the committee from the general treasury funds of a corporation, labor organizations or national banks (including corporate or other business entity credit cards), from any person contributing another’s funds, from a Federal government contractor, or from a foreign national who lacks permanent resident status.

Friends,
I’m not buying what was being sold at the Democratic National Convention.
They tried to portray Joe Biden as a centrist, yet it’s tough to hide the fact that he’s merely a Trojan horse for their socialist agenda.
If Democrats manage to win the White House and hold both chambers of Congress, they will pass extremist legislation, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s ""Green New Deal,"" which will erase American energy independence.
They will defund police departments across the country.
They will make Obamacare worse by expanding the government’s intrusive role into everyone’s healthcare.
All this will be done by raising taxes on hardworking families.
Just take a look at what is going on across the country:
– California has announced they are cutting power to homes for hours each day.
– Citizens are leaving New York City by the thousands each month, because the governor and mayor botched the response to the coronavirus and allowed violent anarchists to run rampant through the streets with impunity.
– Violent crime is up in Chicago, Philadelphia and other major cities.
– Innocent families are living in fear and the working-class are losing their jobs because Democrat politicians want to keep the country closed until after the election.
Please stand with me to help ensure President Trump has the support he needs in Congress.
We must keep our energy independence, support America’s police departments, and ensure that hardworking families are not left behind.
Can you help with these efforts by donating $20.20 for 2020?
We need patriots like you to step up, there is too much at stake to sit on the sidelines.

# Choose You This Day
July 1, 2020
Dear Alex,
Choose you this day. Those words are familiar. It is likely that you have already finished the phrase in your mind.
In his final address, to the nation of Israel, Joshua stood before the nation that he had led into the Promised Land. He reminded them of God's providential care. He reminded them of God's abundant blessings.
Joshua also warned them of the danger that lurked and would attack the foundation of their freedom. Then Joshua challenged the people to make a willful, conscious, decision to choose.
Joshua concluded with his decision. ""As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."" (Joshua 24:15)
Today, America stands at the point of decision. We are in a time like never before.
The primary issues today are no longer about the size of government, tax policy, or regulation. Today we see mob violence, destruction, and an intentional, planned, assault on America.
What began as calls for the removal of memorial statues, has now taken on the face of mob destruction and violence. Today statues of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt are not only criticized but defaced and damaged.
Princeton University removed Woodrow Wilson's name from its Public Policy Center. The Democrat Party in Orange County, California called for the renaming of the John Wayne airport because of comments he made in an interview with Playboy magazine half a century ago.
This mob frenzy has surpassed mere political correctness. It has now metastasized into a cancer that is out to destroy America itself.
Democrats blame President Trump for the violence while at the same time they call for abolishing the police. Seattle handed over several blocks of the city to a lawless mob who apparently could not settle on the name of their newly formed republic, ""Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone"" (CHAZ) or ""Capitol Hill Organized Protest"" (CHOP).
In the first month of CHAZ/CHOP, there were at least six shootings. After three shootings in a 48 hour time frame, one being fatal, the Mayor of Seattle boldly proclaimed that the city ""will not allow for gun violence to continue in the evenings around Capitol Hill.""
The Mayor's proclamation was so effective that 72 hours later there was another shooting. A week later yet another shooting left a 16 year old dead and a 14 year old in critical condition.
Meanwhile, Democrats, including Sanford Bishop, are characteristically silent about the lawlessness, crime, destruction, and decay. The problem is that Democrats have controlled these areas for decades. What happened in a matter of weeks in CHAZ/CHOP was just Democrat leadership on steroids.
Today, America stands at a critical crossroads. The violence and destruction that we see around our nation share no DNA with the values of the people of the 2nd District.
I am speaking up and standing up for your values. I am speaking up and standing up for you as I challenge Sanford Bishop.
I need you to stand with me. I need you to put skin in the game with me.
I am regularly asked if the Republican party will support our race. Yes they will, but they need to see that the people of the 2nd District are standing up. Now is the time to take a stand.
When you donate to Don Cole for Congress, the money stays with my campaign and is focused right here on my campaign. Your contribution will go to promote your values and you can count on that.
You may have never donated to a political campaign before. Now is the time, today is the day.
We are at a time as never before. Right now, you, not anyone else, but you stand at a point of decision.
Some of my readers have already given generously and sacrificially. If you have not given to my campaign yet, then I ask you to do it now.
The number of individual donors is just as important as how much the donors give. Will you put some skin in the game by donating as little as $2.20 (2nd District in 20) or $20.20 (Send DC to DC in 2020)?

# Anticipated Consequences
July 10, 2020
Dear Alex,
Between May 31 and June 27, a mere four weeks, 93 people were shot in Atlanta. That is more than double the number from the same period in 2019.
Not only has the number of shootings doubled, the cost of human lives in the destruction has more doubled. In the same period last year there were six fatal shootings. In the past four weeks, 14 of those shootings ended in death.
The victims included a 10 year old who fortunately survived, an 18 year old, killed while selling bottled water, and an 80 year old man, apparently the unintended victim, killed at his home in a drive-by shooting.
The tragedies heightened on July 4th, when most families were celebrating Independence Day. A precious 8-year old, African American girl was killed by a group of armed men. They stopped the car she was riding in and then opened fire on the car.
That same day a fight broke out at an outdoor party to watch fireworks in Northeast Atlanta. The fight escalated to the shooting of 14 people.
While the gun fight was taking place in Northeast Atlanta, another group opened a battlefront further South. Between 60 and 100 protesters were at the Georgia State Patrol headquarters South of the Capitol area.
Some in the group, armed with rocks and spray paint, targeted the Headquarters. They spray painted the buildings, smashed windows, and tossed what the Atlanta Journal referred to as fireworks through the broken windows.
Whatever they threw in the building started a fire. Two Department of Public Safety personnel were treated for smoke inhalation.
Russell Covey, a criminal law professor at Georgia State, made a misguided observation. He said that lack of police presence “may create something of a vacuum of authority.""
I disagree with Dr. Covey. There was no vacuum of authority. There was plenty of authority at work.
It was not the authority of the city of Atlanta and Georgia law. It was authority exercised by design with strategic, organized, intent by those who hate America and the freedom that we have.
Even the organizers of some of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests said that the ones who attacked the Headquarters were not with them. BLM organizer, Quinton Davis, told WSB TV that the individuals showed up suddenly and immediately got aggressive toward the police.
We need to understand what is taking place here. There are those who are hard at work to instigate anger, division, and hatred between groups.
Their intent and purpose is to undermine and tear down our freedom and liberty. Under the guise of speaking up for some cause, they plant the seeds of destruction in whatever field is fertile.
Our elected leaders play into their hands when they lead based on heightened emotions stoked with spun narrative. The knee-jerk reactions, such as abolishing law enforcement agencies lead to anything but peaceful conversation and positive change.
Headlines in the Atlanta newspaper blare stories of crime, violence, and ultimately death of innocent children. Police desperately want to serve and protect but they can no longer trust the ground rules of policy and the law.
Take a look at where this chaos, confusion, and calamity is taking place. These are all cities controlled by Democrats.
For decades, these cities have had the same problems. The leaders blame the same people. They are stuck on the same platform. They repeat the same promises. Meanwhile their communities steadily perish.
The destruction, chaos, and loss of innocent lives in these cities like Atlanta and Seattle should come as no surprise. The real people who live in these communities are fed up.
There are anticipated consequences. I anticipate a change.
Join me to make a change.
Sincerely,
Signature-Donald-E-Cole

One of the hardest things for me to watch has been the apathetic response to the decline of New York. This used to be one of the cleanest, safest, big cities in the world, but voters ""have become"", as the song goes, ""comfortably numb.""
LOVE for New York
Patriot,
What will it take for people to wake up: Voter fraud, riots, lockdowns, trash piling up, spikes in violent crime, sending COVID positive patients back to nursing homes, corruption, 2 years of the Russia hoax?
Take Back NY-13
New York City is ground zero for the leftist assault on America. I decided to run for Congress because I can’t stand watching the destruction of my beloved home.
One of the hardest things for me to watch has been the apathetic response to the decline of New York. This used to be one of the cleanest, safest, big cities in the world, but voters ""have become"", as the song goes, ""comfortably numb.""
Help Us Finish the Quarter Strong
But it’s not too late. We are ending the quarter and have 5 weeks until the election. Help us meet our financial goals. Radical representatives like my opponent Adriano Espaillat are counting on you to not show up, or support my campaign. Like other Democrats, Espaillat is on board for the woke agenda. He brags about being the first undocumented immigrant in Congress, if that tells you anything.
This is the epitome of leftwing hubris. The modern Democratic Party has contempt for you and the country. Shove it back in their smug faces and support my campaign.

He’d had a measure of notoriety for about 8 years, since he was the spokesman for project called PARK 51 which used a lot of opaque foreign money to gain that unwelcome foothold. While that construction was ultimately blocked, his group did manage to erect a so-called, “Islamic Cultural Center” on adjacent land.

The government’s first priority is the protection of its citizens, everything else is secondary. There is no doubt that this is the first and oldest reason for government. But in the year 2020, haughty progressives believe that we are beyond the need for the police.
LOVE for New York
Fellow Patriot,
There's 1 month until the biggest election of our time. But it seems like Democrats have forgotten the purpose of government.
The government's first priority is the protection of its citizens, everything else is secondary. There is no doubt that this is the first and oldest reason for government. But in the year 2020, haughty progressives believe that we've evolved beyond the need for the police.
I Support Our Police
According to the amNewYork,
> ""NYPD officers also made 607 gun arrests in September 2020 — the highest monthly total recorded since the department launched its CompStat crime tracking program in 1994. Year to date, 2,801 gun arrests have been made by the department — up 7% for the year.""
What happened? Radical politics, that’s what happened. Self-styled ""criminal justice reform activists"" are actually a bunch of Soros funded district attorneys, woke morons, and race baiters. Their game is societal equity, not equality and the results have been disastrous.
> Don't Handcuff The Police
>
What exaclty is the ""transformative change"" being called for by the radical Left?
How many streets need to burn in this social experiment?
Enough is enough.
The Big Apple was once one of the safest cities in the world, and with a return to real policing practices we can achieve that status again. I will fight for law and order. It's time for the adults to take control and Make New York First World Again.
Sincerely,
Lovelynn Gwinn

Because common sense and rationality have flown out the window, the only solutions we hear from Democrats are extreme ones.
LOVE for New York
Fellow New Yorkers,
Abolish the Police. That's the new Leftist tagline.
Because common sense and rationality have flown out the window, the only solutions we hear from Democrats are extreme ones.
Mind you, these are the same individuals who think cops are the only people who should be allowed to carry guns. Quite the oxymoron.
The civilians (mobs) calling for this are useful sheep who think actual good will come of getting rid of the force tasked to deal with crime, but it's a far more sinister goal from the liberal elites, who are obviously using the chaos to their personal advantage.
Contribute just $25 to the Lovelynn Gwinn Campaign!
By honing their sights in on the police, the Democrats have therefore admitted that they've declared war on America.
We CANNOT let them win!
Donate to Lovelynn Gwinn's campaign for District 13 in NYC!
Despite being in the minority demographically, they have slowly taken over EVERY facet of American society. That is why:
* Public schools and universities are indoctrinating your children
* The news outlets are propaganda mills
* Your opinion is silenced on social media
* It's easier to buy recently-illegal drugs than to get a business license
* Criminals are martyred and heroes are vilified
American patriots have been complacent to the theft of our nation for far too long! It is time to take it back, city by city!
That is why you need to elect a TRUE conservative to office. Donate just $25 to my campaign!
Don't let the American Dream die out from the inside.
Sincerely,
Lovelynn Gwinn
Candidate for NY-13

Maybe it’s time to rethink this “police reform” thing. With a terrible record on crime, corruption, and a city that is getting dirtier by the hour, Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced that he has taken the “Obama Foundation pledge to reform policing in our city.” Well Hot damn New York!
LOVE for New York
Friend,
Maybe it’s time to rethink this “police reform” thing. With a terrible record on crime, corruption, and a city that is getting dirtier by the hour, Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced that he has taken the ""Obama Foundation pledge to reform policing in our city.""
$25 Put Up a Fight
According to De Blasio, the Obama Foundation pledge includes:
* Overhauling use-of-force policies
* Instituting de-escalation training
* More police accountability
Wait a minute. This looks like more restrictions on the police! This has been tried across the country, thanks to George Soros, and the effects have been devestating.
An article by James Varney for the Washington Times claims,
> “Soros-backed DAs in Philadelphia, St. Louis, San Francisco and other cities have fired scores of experienced prosecutors and, as promised, stopped prosecuting low-level quality-of-life crimes such as disorderly conduct, vagrancy and loitering.”
$50 Retake Liberal Districts
Varney continues,
> “The city has suffered a crime surge since the Soros-backed prosecutor took office. Violent crime rose by 8.8% since 2006. In terms of violent crimes per 100,000 residents, St. Louis has surpassed Detroit as America’s most violent city.”
Philadelphia too saw a spike in violent crime that reversed positive trends.
> “Homicides in Philadelphia, which fell below 300 annually for four consecutive years through 2016, have again shot up, rising by 34% in 2020 and hitting 257 as of Aug. 3, according to police department figures.”
What's happening in Philadelphia is happening in Democratic-run cities across America including in New York. We deserve better. New York is a world-class city with a world-class police department. It's time to unclip their wings and let them return to doing what they do best, policing!

Now is the time to make that change. For the first time in my life, Republicans have chance to take NYC and with it, the United States House of Representatives. I couldn't be more excited.
Before my campaign for NY CD-13, I was involved revitalization projections on the Upper West Side. You see, cleaning up New York is more than a career in politics— It's my life.
A better New York starts with responsible leadership. Donate today, and together we will make New York deserving of the title ""Empire State"".
Sincerely,
Lovelynn Gwinn
Republican Nominee for Congress NY-13
P.S. We need leaders, not revolutionaries.

Take Back NY-13
New York City is ground zero for the leftist assault on America. I decided to run for Congress because I can’t stand watching the destruction of my beloved home.

But it’s not too late. We are 7 days away from the biggest election in our lifetime. Help us meet our financial goals. Radical representatives like my opponent Adriano Espaillat are counting on you to not show up, or support my campaign. Like other Democrats, Espaillat is on board for the woke agenda. He brags about being the first undocumented immigrant in Congress, if that tells you anything.
This is the epitome of leftwing hubris. The modern Democratic Party has contempt for you and the country. Shove it back in their smug faces and support my campaign.

998,"Radical Democrats are putting our public safety at risk. Here’s how we can fight back.
Mowers for Congress
Exciting news, Alex –
Every time I turn on the news these days, it’s as though I’m flipping through a comic book - cities rife with crime, buildings destroyed, businesses looted, cops attacked, violent riots that turn deadly in our streets...
And it’s not just happening in big cities, it’s right in our own backyards.
America is beginning to look like Gotham City, and it’s time for us to put an end to the insurrection.
As Democrats in Washington turn their backs on law-abiding citizens and police officers in support of rioters and criminals, it’s more important than ever for us to elect a new generation of law and order conservatives like Matt Mowers.
Mowers will stand up to the Left’s efforts to defund the police and protect our Second Amendment rights. That’s why I’m proud to join President Trump, Rep. Elise Stefanik, and more than 350 other Republicans in endorsing Mowers for Congress.
Gov. Scott Walker Endorses Matt Mowers - Donate Now
Radical Democrats are putting our public safety at risk by allowing mobs of violent anarchists to desecrate our cities. They don’t think we deserve police protection against rioters who burn cars or throw bricks through our windows, but they refuse to leave their own homes without private security details. Their hypocrisy makes me sick.
It’s more important than ever for us to send strong conservatives like Matt Mowers to Washington to restore order and keep our families safe. I’m doing everything I can to support Mowers ahead of Election Day, and I hope you will too, Alex.
Help send a law and order conservative to Congress by chipping in $20 to Mowers' campaign today: [[URL REDACTED]]
Regards,
Scott Walker
45th Governor of Wisconsin
Gov. Scott Walker
While Chris Pappas can count on Nancy Pelosi's deep pockets for funding, Matt Mowers is running a campaign funded by supporters like you. Will you chip in to help him fight back against the Left?

Hi Alex
I wanted to be sure that you saw the message from Attorney General Bob Ferguson and got the invitation to this special event on Tuesday, October 6th at 6:00PM on Zoom.
Please see the event details below or RSVP online HERE if you haven't already. I hope to see you next Tuesday!
Mike Pellicciotti
\---------- Forwarded message ---------
From: Attorney General Bob Ferguson
Subject: Join me for an event to elect Mike Pellicciotti as State Treasurer!
Hi Alex,
I'm supporting Mike Pellicciotti because Washingtonians need an independent Treasurer who works for the people and shows up for the job. Join me and Mike on Zoom on Tuesday, October 6th!
As an Assistant Attorney General in my office, I know Mike well. He puts people first by prosecuting financial crimes. As a State Representative, Mike is leading the fight for increased government transparency, smart economic growth, and fiscal accountability.
Mike won the Primary Election -- but his Trump-supporting opponent just dropped over $140,000 into TV ads. In other words, he is going to try and buy this race. In contrast, Mike doesn't accept any corporate contributions. He relies on people like you to fuel his grassroots campaign.
With so much on the line this November, I hope you will join me in supporting Mike Pellicciotti on Tuesday, October 6th at 6:00PM on Zoom.

Which Will We Choose for the Next Generation?
## Featuring special guest Bill Binney
###  Wednesday, July 29 at 7PM EDT
RSVP for the Zoom meeting details
RSVP Today
Dear friends and supporters,
Young Americans have lived their entire lives under the regime of mass surveillance that NSA whistleblower William Binney uncovered. What does mass surveillance do to the mind? What creative thoughts have been kept hidden, in fear of retribution from the unseen watchers?
William Binney has never submitted to the totalitarian policies of the Five Eyes intelligence services. For twenty years, he's waged a fight to reverse the actions of the NSA -- demonstrating that the mass surveillance system was implemented in order to hide the crimes of individuals at the top of the US government, which would have been long ago exposed by the ThinThread program Binney's team developed when he was Technical Director at the NSA. This story is related in the 2015 movie ""A Good American.""
This Wednesday, July 29, at 7PM EDT, Mr. Binney will join the Daniel Burke for Senate campaign for a second time on an online town hall. Daniel has spent the past eight years of his life fighting the same secret government apparatus as a member of the LaRouche movement.
Together they will endeavor to mobilize YOU to take action now to expose the lies told by Mike Pompeo, Joe Biden, and the British oligarchy, beginning with the fraudulent claim that Russia hacked the DNC in 2016.
Please join us Wednesday, July 29, 7pm EDT
The meeting will be conducted on Zoom, please RSVP for details.

Illegal immigration is still an major problem in the United States - Angel Mom Endorses Grosz
Build the Wall.
Angel Mom Sabine Durden shares her heartbreaking story.
For those of you that don’t know, an Angel Mom is the parent of a son or daughter viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant. Her son, Dominic, was killed in 2012. When she reached out to President Obama, she was ignored.
In 2015, when President Trump was campaigning, he reached out to her. He made her journey to seek justice a reachable goal. Since Dominic’s death, his mother has campaigned for stricter border control and tougher penalties for migrants who commit crimes while in the country illegally.
Congresswoman Kathleen Rice supports legislation that helps illegal immigrants take advantage of educational, healthcare and community opportunities in District 04 over those living here legally and struggling to make ends meet. She supports the progressive bail reform that has spiked New York State crime rates.
As Congresswoman, I will help President Trump maintainability the rule of law for all legal immigrants. My primary opponent, Douglas ""Mitt"" Tuman, has stated his goals of equality for all. Does that include illegal immigrants?
Let’s Build The Wall Together and Make NY 04 Great Again!
Vote in Person on Primary Election Day June 23rd!
In person voting supersedes Vote by Mail. If you already mailed in your ballot, your vote in person will be the one to count!

Hey --
Here in South Jersey, we know a thing or two about effectively implementing long-overdue policing reforms. When the Camden community came together to demand change, Donald -- then a State Senator -- joined their efforts to identify effective community-policing strategies, and use them to rebuild the Camden police force from the ground up.
And we saw some pretty incredible results, friend. We had an almost 50% reduction in crime, and our murder rate dropped by almost 70%. And -- more importantly -- the people of Camden felt safer. Officers became a part of the community instead of existing as an outside force, knocking on their neighbors' doors to get to know them and reading books to young children in local schools.
Watch this short interview with Donald today to learn more about these successful policing reform efforts in South Jersey:
WATCH NOW
SHARE ON FACEBOOK
TWEET ON TWITTER
The first step is to admit the problem. Then, it's critical we continue to bring people together and find the reform models that work. Donald says it best: we must push the envelope and continually reassess effectiveness to avoid sliding back into old, harmful patterns.
And -- most importantly -- we must continue to listen to the communities we serve.
We have a long road ahead of us -- but these kinds of community-centered policing reforms are a great place to start. And it's not just policy change on the local level that we need. Donald will continue fighting for federal solutions like the Justice in Policing Act to save Black lives, reinvest in educational and economic opportunities for underserved communities, and keep our communities safer.

Friends--
I am incredibly proud to stand with the LGBTQ community this Pride Month, and every month it takes to make sure no one is denied their freedom because of who they love or how they identify.
This is about equal rights, opportunities, and protections under the law. From marriage equality to life-saving hate crimes legislation, the work of pro-equality activists and lawmakers has helped us make some incredible progress since the Stonewall Riots of 1969.
But we still have a long way to go, friend. Will you join me today in committing to the fight for LGBTQ equality until we finally secure full, lived equality for all Americans?
SIGN THE PETITION
It's important to acknowledge that the first Pride was a protest led by queer and trans people of color. And right now, our country is finally starting to reckon with the racism embedded in American life. Our vision of a more just, equal world must also include black and brown communities who face historic injustice that must be eradicated.
None of us are equal until all of us are equal. Can I count on you to join me in the fight for LGBTQ equality today, friend? Add your name now.
In solidarity,
Donald

Alex --
It was not so long ago that financial companies refused to do business in Black-majority neighborhoods. These discriminatory redlining practices are now illegal -- but they are far from a distant memory.
In the midst of Philadelphia's civil unrest, a handful of opportunistic looters distracted from our message of racial justice by destroying and stealing property from drug stores, retail stores, and other local businesses we've come to rely on. Now, insurance companies are using ""crime scores"" to cut coverage and raise costs in ""high risk"" communities, which we all know means Philly's Black neighborhoods.
Crime scores are just redlining by another name. Join Dwight in speaking out against these new discriminatory policies. Add your name now >>
Abandoning small and minority-owned businesses in their time of need is just plain wrong. Our country is facing a painful but necessary reckoning with our racist history, and a renewed call for racial justice that has been denied for entirely too long. But insurance companies are using this as an opportunity to resurrect new discriminatory redlining practices -- and we must put a stop to it.
Dwight is now working across the aisle on the Helping Entrepreneurs Access Loans (HEAL) Act to funnel desperately needed funds to the businesses impacted by recent looting efforts. The property destroyed or damaged must be repaired and replaced to help small and minority-owned businesses get back up on their feet.
Our community's most vulnerable businesses need our help right now, Alex. If you support Dwight's HEAL Act and his work to end redlining and racial discrimination once and for all, sign the petition today.

Alex,
It's past time for policing reform in this country. For far too long, the federal government has subsidized and promoted an over-militarized approach to urban policing that is deadly for Black communities. The violence perpetrated by those sworn to protect is not new -- and it must be stopped.
In just a minute, we're going to ask you to support Dwight's proactive, community-centered policing strategy -- but first, we'll explain exactly what that means:
1. Expand the “Cop Next Door” program to incentivize officers to live in the communities they serve and build trusting relationships with their neighbors.
2. Create more police satellite offices so officers can be more visible and present in their communities with a safe place to meet with residents, complete paperwork, and even take meals.
3. Provide real-time data using new technologies to better prepare our officers for emerging threats with the information they need without establishing new surveillance.
4. Launching a Safe Place Initiative to make sure no one feels unsafe walking into a police station, fire station, community center, or library if they are in trouble.
5. Establish City Gun Courts to address illegal gun possession and get our streets safer, faster.
6. Work with federal prosecutors on programs like Project Safe Neighborhoods to get the most serious offenders off the street, and educate citizens about this swift punishment for more dangerous crimes like unlawful possession of a firearm.
7. Work with the police department and community groups to implement innovative gun programs to protect families from gun violence by and against juveniles.
Dwight has been advocating for effective, community-based solutions like these his entire life. So please Alex, add your name now to support the kind of policing reform programs that both reduce crime and promote cities’ quality of life and economic growth for all of its citizens.
Thank you,

Happy Pride, Alex!
Every year, we take some time each June to celebrate and lift up our LGBTQIA+ friends and neighbors. It's a time to reflect on how far we've come and recommit ourselves to the fight for full, lived equality that is far from over.
But it's important to remember that the first Pride wasn't a parade -- it was a protest. Led predominantly by queer and transgender people of color, the Stonewall Riots proved to be the catalyst that the LGBTQIA+ rights movement needed. And ever since those activists stood up and demanded better for their community in 1969, our country has seen incredible progress in non-discrimination protections, access to marriage and adoption services, hate crime legislation, and more.
But we've still got so much more work to do, Alex. It's not lost on me that this year's Pride month is kicking off amidst a historic uprising of fed-up Americans ready to fight for justice that has been denied for far too long. This month -- and every month -- I stand with Black Lives Matter, and I stand with the LGBTQIA+ community.
We must continue working together to make our shared vision of justice for all a lived reality. And I hope you'll join me in this critical fight. Add your name now to stand in solidarity with our Black, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, non-binary, queer, intersex, asexual, and two-spirit friends and neighbors.
I truly believe that, one day, we will live in a country where all of us will be able to live, work, and prosper freely -- no matter the color of our skin, who we love, or how we identify. We just have to keep putting in the work that transformative change requires.
In solidarity,
Dwight

Dear Alex \--
My proposed Justice Act
* Crooked #Politicians do not win
* #BadCops do not win
* The #PIC (Prison Industrial Complex) does not win
BUT THE #Citizens are #Protected because what has been protected #Evil, will now be #Punished.
1. Any murder that was premeditated; or a murder that involved rape or torture; or a murder that involved a child under the age of 18, the sentence shall be life without parole.
2. Any prosecutor or other law enforcement officer, found to have lied to a judge, jury or withheld evidence in order to gain a conviction, shall be sentenced to 5 years, plus the number of years served by the innocent victim. If the victim was executed or died by an act of violence perpetrated by another inmate, the sentence shall be life.
3. Qualified Immunity shall be abolished.
4. Anyone charged with murder based on circumstantial evidence shall have access to DNA testing.
5. Inmates on death row that were convicted on circumstantial evidence or eyewitness testimony shall have access to DNA testing.
6. Any person that was wrongly convicted shall be compensated for time served based on a formula of lost income potential, plus $250,000 dollars for each year served.
7. Any individuals found to have conspired to murder, frame another person for a crime or lied while testifying under oath, shall be sentenced to 20 years without parole.
8. Any felon found with an illegal firearm shall be sentenced to 5 years for first conviction, 10 for the second and life for the third. Question: Who gets to determine which firearm is legal or illegal?
9. Any person who has been convicted of any crime except murder, rape or child abuse and has completed their sentence and remained a Law-Abiding Citizen for 7 years shall have their records sealed and all rights restored automatically and without request.
10. Tax incentives shall be given to employers who hire persons formerly convicted of crimes.
11. Any crimes not involving a victim of any kind, not involving an act that could lead to injury or death of other persons shall no longer be sentenced to jail or prison.
12. Law Enforcement Officials shall not be used for revenue generation. Certain exemptions for things such as parking tickets or DWIs will be excluded. Technology, where possible and not in violation of our constitutional protections, should be employed instead. This will allow LEOs to focus on violent crimes and it will go far in improving relations with #Citizens.

1013,"Hello!
A while ago you showed interest in Mark Richardson and his bid to become your next Representative for District 3 of Ohio.
Currently it is held by Joyce Beatty, a Democrat who has held it for 3 terms, 12 years. During that time, Ohio has greatly increased in crime, poverty, addiction, loss of jobs, and so forth.
She ignores her constituents.
Mark is a decorated combat veteran of the US Navy. He was a helicopter pilot in a famous rescue mission of US hostages when the radical islamicists took over Persia, aka, Iran, and almost died when his helicopter went down during that mission.
He is fighting to protect your Constitutionally guaranteed, God-given rights.
Of all elections, each of which was more important, this one is critical. This election determines if you remain free with your freedoms intact and restored, with Mark's win, or if they are corroded and denied to you if the Democrat wins.
Mark is a genuine Republican, conservative, a Consitutionalist, an entrepreneur, and knows what it takes to run a business.
If you would like to help, please call the Volunteer Recruiter and Coordinator, Lori Sorensen, at 614-330-2150.
Thank you!
Sincerely,
Dean Sorensen

Each time I write to our campaign's supporters, I look at the world we share and reflect on how we've reached this scale of human suffering. We are witnessing a world on fire. We are living through a pandemic that has cost 100,000 American lives and left 40 million Americans unemployed. We have a government that is unwilling to provide and protect for the basic needs of its people, leaving many on the fringe and in danger of losing their housing, financial, food security at any moment.
We talk to residents every day about what their needs are, how they view the state of our country and our role and responsibility to do better. Most people we speak to are doing their best to survive. They ask about resources to pay rent, how to get apply for unemployment, or how to get their electricity restored. In recent days, we've mourned the death of George Floyd at the hands of police and the importance of racial solidarity and supporting the Black Lives Matter movement.
Words matter and we want to share a message we received from a local woman in Forest Hills the same day that George Floyd was murdered in Minnesota.
""COVID-19 has just shown me how disposal certain lives are. Do not act like you care if you don't. Do not act like you have the Black communities' best interest at heart. A hate crime against one Black person is a hate crime against all Black persons. But we're supposed to break our backs for a country that has always saw us as disposal cattle?""
If you've spent a lifetime feeling angry and helpless about where we are today, you need to vote and stay engaged. We'll be writing you more often as Election Day approaches. Stay safe everyone. - Sandra Choi

ImmigrantlyPod Interview
As a challenger we don't have many opportunities to share our story. Feature clip below. I hope all our supporters take the time and listen to this interview. This podcast interview with @immigrantlypod was a deeply personal one. No matter how one rationalizes it- politics, policies and campaigning demand that each candidate reflects on who you are, why you’re running and why you over everyone else. We discuss our campaign's vision and platform, importance of racial solidarity, what it means to be a progressive, the need for comprehensive immigration reform and the joy campaigning as an introvert.

1015,"Vote Gabi for Michigan's 9th Congressional District
Republican Candidate for Michigan's 9th district In the U.S. House of Representatives
DEFUND AND DISMANTLE THE POLICE?
STOP LEFTIST EXTREMISM!
The craziest new idea from the left: defunding and dismantling our police. With the support of the Democrat party and the liberal media, this dangerous nonsense is gaining traction.
City councils nationwide are caving in to voices of extremists, voting to defund or remove police departments while endangering our public safety.
Mayors and blue state governors are endorsing it and turning their backs to the citizens.
Prominent educators, big city sheriffs and public figures have been silenced for speaking out against the idea.
Cartoons and television shows themed after law enforcement are being canceled. Even Lego stopped manufacturing police-themed toys!
At the federal level, our 9th District representative, Democrat Andy Levin, has publicly supported this madness. He is cosponsoring legislation and is calling for us to ""reimagine what just policing looks like.""
REIMAGINE? What exactly does that mean?
We currently enjoy responsive police services, who protect us, our homes and businesses from crime and/or the rise of leftist chaos and mayhem. We have nothing to gain and everything to lose by cutting funding to our heroes in blue.
Who in the 9th district would benefit from reduced funding and dismantling the police departments?
Who exactly is Andy Levin representing?
The left wants to disarm us while endangering our public safety, leaving us vulnerable to looting, rioting, and crime. We cannot allow our communities to fall for this crazy ideology.
This November, vote for a representative who will actually advance the interests of the residents in Michigan's 9th Congressional district.
