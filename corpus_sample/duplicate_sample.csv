Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
BREAKING from The New York Times: If Mark Kelly wins in Arizona, he could cast the DECIDING VOTE to stop Trump's SCOTUS nominee
A message from Mark Kelly
Donate $5 (becomes $20)
Team -- There has NEVER been so much at stake in a Senate race:
The New York Times announced that if Mark Kelly wins in Arizona, he could be sworn in EARLY and cast the DECIDING VOTE against Trump's SCOTUS nominee!
But recent polling has Mark Kelly just a hair ahead of his GOP opponent. And with control of the Supreme Court on the line, Mitch McConnell and the entire GOP just unleashed an UNPRECEDENTED onslaught of attack ads to defeat Mark!
Failing to fight back could mean losing our ONLY chance to save the Supreme Court.
That's why we set a goal to raise $250,000 to flip the Senate, but right now, we're on track to fall DANGEROUSLY short. We MUST hit this goal, and we won't meet it without your help.
Please, rush in $5 (becomes $20) to elect Mark Kelly, flip the Senate, and save our Supreme Court! No fight is more urgent >>
Donate $5 (becomes $20)
Donate $10 (becomes $40)
Donate $25 (becomes $100)
Rush Another Amount
Thank you so much for stepping up,

Getting Democrats to the polls is the most effective way to win elections -- and increasing Democratic Voter Turnout is the only way to defeat Donald Trump.
Barack Obama: Elections matter. Voting matters.
Our country is going through dark times. But we can‚Äôt stop fighting for progress when it matters most. We can‚Äôt sit idly by while Republicans rip apart our Democracy. We have a moral obligation to fight for ourselves, our grandchildren, and our future.
That‚Äôs why we need your help! Passing Medicare for All, saving Social Security, and making Trump a one term President will take a MASSIVE increase in Democratic Voter Turnout.
Donate to Progressive Turnout Project ‚Üí
Our plan? Use data & science to win elections and change the world. We design, test, and execute Voter Turnout campaigns to elect a wave of Democrats nationwide. We‚Äôre working around the clock to knock doors, make phone calls, and skyrocket Democratic Voter Turnout to the highest levels ever in 2020.
ONE-ON-ONE CONVERSATIONS WITH VOTERS
HISTORIC INCREASE IN VOTER TURNOUT
SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN RESULTS
We build on existing research and run our own experiments on new tactics to make sure our campaigns have the largest impact possible. That means every single dollar you donate will make a huge difference -- we guarantee it!
Remember: we‚Äôre a 100% grassroots-funded organization. Every single cent of our funding comes from 275,000+ generous Democrats chipping in whatever they can afford (our average donation is just $14!). And that‚Äôs why we email you so often -- because we really need your help!

We need lit, snacks, and water to build a first-rate field operation.
Friends,
The primary is less than a month away, and our team has scaled up to keep our momentum going strong. I‚Äôve been humbled by the volunteers stepping up from across our community to join our grassroots movement, and I‚Äôm proud to be out there myself, talking with voters about the issues that most concern them.
But in order to have a top-notch field program, we need to make sure our volunteers have the supplies they need. That means everything from tools for reaching voters ‚Äî like clipboards and campaign literature ‚Äî to tools for keeping our canvassers walking blocks like snacks, ponchos, and gas money.
We‚Äôre working to ensure every voter across the district knows what our campaign is about, but in order to have a first-rate field operation, I need your help ‚Äî will you pitch in today so our canvassers have the tools they need?
$5 for a box of pens
$10 for a ream of paper
$20 for clipboards
$30 for campaign flyers
Our team is growing daily and reaching more and more Collin County voters ‚Äî but we need our stock of campaign supplies to grow with our team.
Let‚Äôs send our canvassers out with the supplies we need to reach voters. Chip in and help flip Collin County in 2020!
Thanks to you, we‚Äôre going to flip TX-03 blue ‚Äî it starts right here, right now, with all of us working together.

Fellow Patriot,
The radical left has officially lost their minds... and they're no longer holding back.
Riots in the streets... burning U.S. flags... even the MURDER of Trump supporting Americans.
The very fabric of our country is being purposefully ripped apart and trampled... and President Trump is the ONLY thing standing in the way of their complete and utter takeover.
It's becoming clearer each and every day - this election is the most important decision America has faced in generations.
The choice is clear: Law & Order or Total Chaos.
What we do right now will determine the fate of America as we know it.

BREAKING: Donald Trump Jr. is flying back to Georgia tomorrow!
Alex, Donald Trump's visit to Georgia last week only made things worse for him and his ""favorite Senator,"" David Perdue, who disgraced himself by mocking Senator Kamala Harris.
So Donald Trump is sending his son back to Georgia tomorrow, days before Election Day, to try to reverse momentum and clean up the damage. It won't work, Alex.
Make a donation before Don Jr. arrives tomorrow to show him and his father that their visits to Georgia are only increasing Democratic momentum here.

$25 ‚Üí
$55 ‚Üí

$100 ‚Üí

Just like Don Jr.'s last trip didn't reverse Democratic momentum here. Nor did President Trump's previous two trips. Or visits from Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Attorney General Bill Barr.
Trump and the Republicans are terrified of Democrats winning in Georgia. They know if they lose here, they won't just lose the presidency -- they'll lose their Senate majority too. Alex, donate $25 right now to make sure that happens.
