Emails like this are a critical part of our ability to run a strong campaign that can win.
Alex,
Being a leader means more than having a title or an elected office. It means showing up when it matters most. It’s speaking truth to power, providing hope in times of fear, and bringing people from all walks of life together.
J.D. Scholten has already proven that he can be that leader for Iowa’s 4th district. He has moved our campaign online to protect the health of our staff, volunteers, and voters. We’ve already held a virtual town hall to share resources, and we’re doing our best to provide helpful and accurate information, bring more people into this campaign, and engage with voters every day.
Meanwhile, Steve King posts memes online that make light of this pandemic and votes against life-saving legislation that would provide free coronavirus testing, paid sick leave, and more.
We need to elect J.D., a leader who will Stand Tall for All. To do that, we need to stay on track and meet our goals. We know that this is an incredibly difficult time for folks in Iowa and across the country, but if you’re able, can you chip in $5 before our end-of-quarter fundraising deadline?
DONATE
We have no idea what the next few months will bring -- but we need to be ready for anything. That means having the funds to keep in touch with Iowans and making sure J.D. can continue hosting virtual town halls and other online events.
We can’t trust Steve King to keep us informed, and we certainly can’t trust him to protect our families.
It’s never been more clear that we need a change in leadership.
There is so much at stake. If you can, we’d be so grateful for a donation to make sure we close out the quarter with the resources we need to keep fighting.

6,Sarah Riggs Amico,info@sarahforgeorgia.com,Where is small business relief going?,"#
Hey all,
There’s no denying it: Thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, we’re seeing the beginning of a difficult economic downturn here in Georgia and across the country.
Small businesses, the kind of companies that employ nearly 50% of American workers and are the backbone of this country’s economy, have been the hardest hit.
And while the small business paycheck protection loans included in the CARES Act and subsequent expansions have certainly saved jobs, we have to make sure that the hundreds of billions Congress approved to keep Americans employed through this crisis is actually going to the small businesses that need it most.
That’s why I’m calling on Congress to make sure the next coronavirus relief package includes transparency provisions for small business loans so we know that the money is getting where it can do the most good. We need to know exactly what companies received relief loans, how much they were given, and what they plan to do with it.
Please, take a moment to add your name and urge Congress to take action to ensure relief funding is distributed wisely, fairly, and transparently as we work toward rebuilding our economy.
ADD YOUR NAME
Here’s the thing: Even though the Paycheck Protection Program has helped some Main Street businesses keep their employees paid, relief funding has also gone to Wall Street and large, profitable corporations who don’t need it as much as mom and pop stores desperately do.
And the money for small businesses just keeps running out. Because of how the PPP was structured, up to 90% of businesses owned by people of color have been shut out of the program. That’s unacceptable, and will only make this economic crisis hit communities of color worse.
I know how important it is to keep folks employed during an economic downturn \-- I saw it as my family worked to build a business and save jobs through the Great Recession. And I know that the businesses that are at risk of laying their employees off are the mom and pop restaurants, local grocers, family-owned landscaping companies, and more small and local businesses like them.
These are the small businesses we need to protect -- so they can protect their employees.
You’ve heard the phrase, “Too big to fail.” Small businesses might not have the same clout in Washington as Fortune 500 companies, but there’s nothing “small” about their combined economic impact. That’s why we have to protect small businesses in the next relief bill, and why we need to make sure the next coronavirus relief package is transparent about where relief aid goes.
If you agree, sign on to our petition demanding transparency in Paycheck Protection Program loans.
Thank you for your support.
Stay safe,
Sarah

Alex,
Democrats just won a huge legal victory over the Trump agenda.
U.S. District Judge Fred Biery has agreed with Democrats in Texas, ordering that absentee ballots be made available to those “who seek to vote by mail to avoid transmission of the virus.” It’s a huge win for election security and a huge defeat for Trump’s anti-voter agenda.
But Texas’s Republican AG, Ken Paxton, says he will immediately appeal the decision. And Trump is ramping up his attacks on vote-by-mail as well \-- threatening to deny relief aid to states that seek to implement wider absentee ballot access because of his concern it’ll cost him the election.
43% of Americans still support Donald Trump, who’s continuing his attacks on vote-by-mail by the day. We need to know if you’ll stand up to him and stand for our right to participate in this year’s election without fear. Tell us:

# Nicole Galloway for Missouri
Black lives matter. And we need action.
That's why this week, we’ve launched our Agenda for Black Missourians.
Faith teaches us that it is impossible to heal what is ignored. Missouri has witnessed powerful examples of healing through countless acts of unity, with citizens and law enforcement standing in solidarity, wanting change.
Our children deserve to live in a Missouri that is fair and accountable to all of its citizens.
This framework agenda begins an ongoing conversation that I will continue to have with activists, concerned citizens, legislators, and members of the clergy from all across Missouri.
As a state, we must not just say Black Lives Matter in the street but show it with the executive actions we take and the laws we pass.
Here’s how I’ll get it done:
Reform Missouri’s Criminal Justice System
Building community trust in law enforcement and the justice system requires transparency and accountability. Civilian oversight of law enforcement and transparency through the use of body cameras are steps we’ve known are needed since Ferguson. It’s time to get this done. I will implement measures that increase transparency and accountability in law enforcement through strong oversight, local control, and reform of policing practices.
Make Protections Against Racial Discrimination the Law
Missouri will never succeed until everyone can live and work without fear of discrimination simply because of who they are. Our shared success depends on striving for equality in opportunity. I will put protections against racial discrimination in the Missouri Constitution and increase protections in the workplace and in housing.
Increase Economic Opportunity for Black Communities
For too long, economic policies have prioritized flashy developments and chasing out of state companies. We’re not economically empowering people and communities to build futures for their families where they live. We need an economic development strategy that addresses family needs and creates opportunities in communities that need them most.
Greater Access to Affordable Healthcare
This pandemic has impacted Black Missourians in a far more disproportionate way than in other states. That’s because Missouri hasn’t made healthcare a priority. Medicaid Expansion is the most important step we can take to make healthcare more accessible in a time when it is desperately needed. Governor Parson opposes it. I’ll implement it.
Expanded Access to Voting
Change begins with civic participation. In Missouri, we don’t make it easy to vote under normal circumstances, let alone during an infectious disease pandemic. It’s voter suppression by design. Missouri needs everyone participating in our democracy, no-excuse absentee vote by mail, without a ballot notarization requirement, automatic voter registration, and widespread early voting.

We know that we're in a challenging moment as a country. Your number one priority should be the health and safety of yourself and your loved ones. Here's a link to the Centers for Disease Control to keep informed. But Alex, we can't completely pause our campaign -- we still have work to do to help Julia Brownley win re-election. So if you can, we'd appreciate if you read our email below:
Alex,
I’m the first Democrat to represent Ventura County in over 70 years.
That makes my seat one of the most vulnerable in the entire country… and now I’m being challenged by a far-right Republican.
I need you in this fight with me. Please, chip in $5 or $10 to my re-election campaign today! →
RUSH A $5 DONATION →
I hate asking you for money. I really do. But unfortunately, I have to, because I’m at risk of losing my seat to a far-right Republican in November.
If we want to keep the House blue, we HAVE to hold onto Democratic seats in California -- we simply can’t afford to lose races like mine.
This is going to be a tough fight, Alex.
I’m facing a HUGE fundraising deadline this month, so my team has set a goal of raising $1,000 by the end of the day today to stay on track. Can you chip in?
$5 →
$35 →
$50 →
$100 →
$250 →
Other →
I’m fighting in Congress for affordable health care, quality, accessible education, and an economy that works for everyone.
That’s why the people of Ventura Country elected me -- a Democrat! -- after 70 years of Republican leadership.
They were ready for change, not more of the same old, same old.
But look, the GOP isn’t ready to give this seat up. They’re going to fight tooth and nail to win it back for my ultra-conservative opponent.
So Alex, I’m going to need your help. Can you chip in to my re-election campaign today? Even just $5 will make a huge difference:
$5 →
$35 →
$50 →
$100 →
$250 →

Alternate text
Friend,
Over the past months, the party of Nancy Pelosi and Carolyn Long have been enabling lawlessness, the gutting of small businesses, and the disrespecting of our first responders.
And it’s no surprise that the biggest supporters of Pelosi and Long are the ones going one step further by pushing to Defund the Police.
Radical groups like Indivisible have long supported Carolyn Long and have even devoted time to training her supporters.
And what do they want for our law enforcement agencies? To defund the very organizations that protect our families and communities rather than build solutions that can better unite our country.
Do You Support Defund the Police?
Our nation’s law enforcement officers have made it their mission to protect citizens and provide us with a safer America, and by embracing rather than disavowing these radical groups, Carolyn Long is placing herself firmly on the wrong side of history.
The myopic focus on Defunding the Police distracts from the critical reforms we should be working towards. Stopping the radical left from Defunding the Police as a partisan attack starts today!
Sign our petition today to demand Carolyn Long disavow these radical groups who want to destabilize our communities and make America less safe!
Thanks,
Team Jaime

TWO: Darrell Issa is a failed former Congressman only interested in pushing his far-right conspiracy theories and Donald Trump’s agenda.
THREE: But with thousands of grassroots supporters, we can defeat Issa, help save the House Majority and WIN in November!
Ammar Campa-Najjar and Darrell Issa are STATISTICALLY TIED!
Can I count on you to help me win?

24,Team Kim,info@andykimforcongress.com,He flipped his seat blue for the first time in 84 years,"Alex,
In 2018, we elected Andy in an election that people called the ""blue wave."" Democrats across the country, ready to fight for the interests of all Americans, won in districts that had been written off as Republican strongholds. But before that, one New Jersey Democrat had already made history. Back in 2016, Congressman Josh Gottheimer flipped his seat blue for the first time in 84 years.
When Andy joined Josh in flipping a critical district, it sent Republicans into overdrive. They've made beating New Jersey Democrats one of their top priorities!
Help us show DC Republicans that Josh and Andy's seats aren't up for grabs. Chip in now to split a donation between our campaigns.
Since being elected, Josh and Andy have been working hard to create jobs, lower the cost of health care, and protect working families. We need their voices and their leadership in Congress now more than ever.
Republicans are willing to do -- and spend -- whatever it takes to beat us in 2020. A recent poll has them up by one point in districts like Josh and Andy's. And if they win here, they could take back the majority in the House. The only way we can stop that from happening is with grassroots support.
Chip in now to ensure Josh and Andy have the resources they need to win. Split a contribution between our campaigns now to help us keep the Democratic Majority in the House.
Thank you,

Hamilton County’s Health Department just issued a warning of “potential COVID-19 exposure at the Lincoln Day Dinner.” Last Friday, James Mackler’s opponents for Tennessee’s open U.S. Senate seat appeared unmasked at the widely attended political event. They’ve also both routinely downplayed the seriousness of the highly contagious virus and transmitted themselves across Tennessee in person in search of votes.
James knows real leaders don’t put their own political gain ahead of the health and safety of the people they seek to serve. And in this new crisis, we need more people like James, and fewer people like his opponents, representing us in the U.S. Senate.
Tomorrow is a big day, and whether or not we’re able to share James’ story of service with voters across the Volunteer State depends on what we do now. We have a goal to raise $20,000 for our Primary Day Fund before midnight tomorrow. If you can, please chip in today.

I’m so grateful for the support you’ve shown me and my campaign team. Thanks to your support, we’ve been able to lay a strong foundation for our campaign for Attorney General.
The outcome of this race is critical for Missouri \-- our current unelected Attorney General is suing to end protections for people with pre-existing conditions rather than protecting our rights. Instead of doing his job, he’s trying to dismantle essential protections for the most vulnerable among us.
Eric Schmitt and his fellow Republicans want the ACA gone, and they will do whatever it takes, regardless of the consequences to working families.
But in order to stop Eric Schmitt and save the ACA, I need your help. Our first quarterly fundraising deadline of the year is coming up at the end of March, and we’ve set weekly benchmarks to ensure that we stay on track to compete with Eric Schmitt and his big-money donors. Unfortunately, right now, we are very short of where we need to be by tomorrow night. I’m hoping you can help.
We need to raise $2,540 more by midnight tomorrow to stay on track. Can you pitch in $25, $50, or whatever you can today to help us hit our goal? You can use this link to give: [[URL REDACTED]]
Thank you for everything you’ve done and for being such an important part of this campaign. When we win in November, it will be because of people like you.

I am writing this email with an energized spirit and a heart full of gratitude. Thanks to your support, we've reached our most important fundraising goal yet.
Lexie is still crunching the numbers, but the big takeaway we know: Our final report to the FEC before Election Day is going to show we've got the resources to flip this district and give Mike Garcia the boot.
It's the moments like these and the people like you that keep me going through the toughest moments of election season. Each time I've asked, you all have stepped up to the plate and helped secure the resources we need to run a winning campaign.
I know that every dollar is personal, especially during these challenging times, and each donation is an investment towards a better future. I won't let you down.
We now have more momentum than ever, and I look forward to the weeks ahead. We will make CA-25 a healthier, safer, more equitable place for everyone. I am so proud of the movement we're building together -- it's a team effort, and there is no doubt I have the best team out there.
Now let's go out and win this damn thing.
Many thanks,
Christy

John Cornyn just put out another ridiculous ad trying to convince Texans that he’s “thoughtful.”
SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT
Here are some examples of how “thoughtful” John Cornyn is:
* He voted in favor of the lawsuit to repeal the Affordable Care Act in the midst of a pandemic, DESPITE hundreds of thousands of Texans relying on it for their health care.
* He called expanded unemployment insurance for all those suffering from COVID-19 “a mistake.”
* He said months ago that “there’s no urgency” to pass COVID-19 relief.
* He told a Dreamer that by advocating for other Dreamers, “this is not helping your cause, okay. This is not helping.”
* He played down climate change and the hottest temperatures on record by tweeting out “It’s summer.”
* And of course, he tweeted THIS:
Corona Cornyn
More than 225,000 dead Americans later, and the pandemic is still raging. The economy is in shambles, and John Cornyn has the audacity to claim that he’s “thoughtful.”

Friends,
These are chaotic and stressful days. We will get through this by relying on our uniquely Texan spirit. We never give up, we always persevere, and we rely on our community to get us through times like these.
As a pharmacist and small business owner operating on the front lines of the outbreak, I am heading to work every day to do my job serving patients and providing high-quality care.
Today, at one of my pharmacies at 12:30pm, I will be going live on Facebook to discuss COVID-19 and its impact on our communities. I hope you can join us!
* Who: Will Douglas, pharmacist & Republican nominee for TX-HD-113
* Date: Monday, March 30
* When: 12:30pm CT
* Where: Will Douglas's campaign Facebook Page
While my campaign is still very much moving at full steam, we will continue to shift our focus away from public events to social media and technology-based campaigning. See below for a brief recap of our past week...
On Wednesday, I recorded a short video from my pharmacy with my thoughts on our current situation: these are tough and challenging times, but Texas will emerge stronger as we always do. Please click through to watch.
Please excuse the clutter. Like other small business owners, this week I was crunching numbers and trying to chart a course for an unknown future and exploring what options are available. It’s critical we have legislators in the State House who have first-hand knowledge of the challenges that business owners face during crises like this.

We need lit, snacks, and water to build a first-rate field operation.
Friends,
The primary is less than a month away, and our team has scaled up to keep our momentum going strong. I’ve been humbled by the volunteers stepping up from across our community to join our grassroots movement, and I’m proud to be out there myself, talking with voters about the issues that most concern them.
But in order to have a top-notch field program, we need to make sure our volunteers have the supplies they need. That means everything from tools for reaching voters — like clipboards and campaign literature — to tools for keeping our canvassers walking blocks like snacks, ponchos, and gas money.
We’re working to ensure every voter across the district knows what our campaign is about, but in order to have a first-rate field operation, I need your help — will you pitch in today so our canvassers have the tools they need?
$5 for a box of pens
$10 for a ream of paper
$20 for clipboards
$30 for campaign flyers
Our team is growing daily and reaching more and more Collin County voters — but we need our stock of campaign supplies to grow with our team.
Let’s send our canvassers out with the supplies we need to reach voters. Chip in and help flip Collin County in 2020!
Thanks to you, we’re going to flip TX-03 blue — it starts right here, right now, with all of us working together.
Yours in this fight,

Alex,
Joe Biden is winning seniors. And that’s great.
But if we want to win downballot races and build a movement that gets us past 2020, Democrats need to invest in the future! That means investing in young people!
Blue Future is bringing young people into the political process and turning them into always-voters. But the DNC’s budget for youth organizing is still exactly $0.
Right-wing billionaires invest millions in the likes of Charlie Kirk and Ben Shapiro, trying to create a right-wing youth movement. Democrats take young voters for granted. Blue Future is changing that―but we need your help! Chip in $5 today!
The earlier people get involved in politics, the more likely that they are to stay engaged throughout their lives. A high schooler we can register and turn out this Election Day has at least 60-80 years of Democratic voting ahead of them. That’s why Blue Future’s work is so important.
Together, our impact will be felt this year. While the media focuses on Biden vs. Trump, we’re organizing for down-ballot races that will determine who controls the state legislatures that can undo Republican gerrymandering. Without that, we’ll never bring about a Blue Future.
The DNC isn’t investing in youth organizing―but Blue Future is! Chip in today to maximize our youth voter outreach!
Young people are left-leaning, but Democrats can’t afford to take them for granted. To win, we must turn out in record numbers to show that in America, everyone counts, that everyone’s vote is counted. With your help, we won’t stop until we swear in a government of, by and for the people.
Together, we’re building a Blue Future!

Time and time again these GOP Senators have voted in lockstep with Donald Trump — letting their loyalty to power and dark money come before their promise to serve their country.
Now, their Senate seats are hanging on by a thread in the midst of this Supreme Court fight. The New York Times just released a series of polls from battleground states showing these Senators lagging behind their Democratic challengers!
National Republicans are terrified of losing their majority. Right now, they’re dumping tens of millions into Maine, Arizona, North Carolina, and other battleground states just to stay above water.

Attached below is our Tea Party 2020 Election Report with critical details on the situation facing us in November:
Fellow Conservative,
**CLASSIFIED: DO NOT FORWARD OR SHARE**
2020 ELECTION REPORT
From:  TEA PARTY ELECTION HQ
Re: 2020 ELECTION WARCHEST - $1 MILLION IN 30 DAYS
Our internal fundraising reports for 2nd quarter of 2020 just came out, and we're severely behind in critical fundraising compared to the massive haul by BLM and their vast leftist political operation. If they continue their strong fundraising lead, they'll also continue their scorched-earth strategy to pull down our statues, rewrite our nation's history, and ultimately defeat President Trump in November!
The likelihood they'll prevail and achieve Obama's goal of ""fundamentally transforming"" America is now closer than it's ever been! And they'll succeed if we do not fight back IMMEDIATELY!
DEFEAT THE RADICAL LEFT
SOCIALIST BLM PROBLEM: The radical socialist network led by BLM is growing emboldened by weak-kneed leaders caving to their idiotic demands, which is prompting leftist donors to jump onboard with LOTS of cash. The worst part is that momentum in the last 30 days has given them a massive fundraising dollar advantage in the MILLIONS!
TEA PARTY PAC ANSWER: The Tea Party PAC is leading the war to back President Trump with critical ammo to defeat the radical Left ahead of November. Ensuring we overtake BLM and their radical network BEFORE the end of the month is a make-or-break situation for victory in November!

BREAKING: BLM Supporter Caught Setting WildFire – This Is Shocking
Fellow Patriot,
The radical left has officially lost their minds... and they're no longer holding back.
Riots in the streets... burning U.S. flags... even the MURDER of Trump supporting Americans.
The very fabric of our country is being purposefully ripped apart and trampled... and President Trump is the ONLY thing standing in the way of their complete and utter takeover.
It's becoming clearer each and every day - this election is the most important decision America has faced in generations.
The choice is clear: Law & Order or Total Chaos.
What we do right now will determine the fate of America as we know it.
Will you add your name in support of Donald Trump and confirm your seat on the TRUMP TRAIN today?

Please, add your name today and confirm your seat on the Trump Train to VICTORY!

While we all continue to deal with the fallout from coronavirus and the responses by our local and state governments, and even though the House isn’t meeting right now, we must stay vigilant and watch their every move. The left wants so badly to use the virus as the reason to bail out profligate, blue states. We cannot let them!
Ongoing Action
Pray for our nation!
Action Item #1
Call or use the online contact form for your federal Representative and Senators to tell them NO state bailouts! Democrat Governors and their allies in Congress want to use federal tax dollars to bail out blue states that have spent decades overspending and overtaxing their residents. Now they see that there’s a possibility they could get money to bail out their bankrupt pension funds (as one example) with tax dollars from citizens who live in states that have responsibly managed their budgets. Their goal is to use coronavirus as the excuse, blaming their budget shortfalls on the virus, rather than on their decades of bad behavior. So, we must speak up now against this!

Sample Script/Content for Contact Form
Hi, my name is [Your Name], and I live in [City, State]. I’m contacting you to urge you to vote NO on any state bailouts. It is fundamentally unfair to make the taxpayers in a state that has been fiscally responsible bail out the states that have been fiscally irresponsible for decades. And, it is shameless to use coronavirus as the excuse. It would be a travesty of justice and a violation of our system of federalism to force one state to pay for the bad behavior of another. I strongly urge you to stand against any form of a state bailout. Thank you.
Action Item #2
Email or call your Governor’s office with the following information, depending on the situation in your state.
* If your state has released plans to reopen soon: Thank them and encourage them to continue with the reopening plans.
* If your state is not reopening/the lockdown is being extended: Urge them to start reopening your state and communities, and to stop the lockdowns.
Action Item #3
If you or someone in your family (like your spouse, for example) has been laid off personally, please send us a video about what happened to you. Talk about how you were doing before all of this, how you’re doing now, and whether or not you are optimistic about your future. There are many people in the media, on the left, and even some conservatives who keep repeating the idea that joblessness is not really a big deal. Or, that the economic devastation is not a big deal.
In order to get you back to work so you can care for your family, we need to show the truth. We need to show that every job loss is a personal tragedy for that person and that family. They’re not vague, impersonal numbers. You are a real person and there were real consequences when you lost your job because of government orders. Additionally, we all care about protecting vulnerable, high-risk Americans, but we should also care about protecting families from enforced destitution. We can care about both at the same time!

54,Theresa Greenfield,info@dscc.org,We're in the fight of our lives to flip Iowa's U.S. Senate seat,"Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
Hey folks,
Theresa Greenfield here, and I'm running for the U.S. Senate in Iowa. My race to flip this Senate seat in Iowa is the closest in the country -- the most recent poll has us down one, 45%-44%, with my Republican opponent.  Can you step up right away to help us flip this seat and take back the Senate for Democrats?
Growing up on my family farm, I never thought I'd run for Senate. But after my first husband died -- leaving me with a thirteen-month-old and another one on the way -- Social Security survivor benefits helped keep my family out of poverty.
So when I heard that my Republican opponent said that she wanted to go ""behind closed doors"" to gut Social Security, it made my blood boil.
I'm a scrappy farm kid, so I never back down from a fight. And boy are we in the fight of our lives to flip this Senate seat. Our race is neck-and-neck, and poll after poll shows it. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight calls this race a toss-up. That's why Mitch McConnell and his allies are spending over $80 million on our race to stop this grassroots team.
Control of the Senate hinges on Iowa and I need your help. Please, will you rush in $5, or whatever you can, to help my campaign and the DSCC in the home stretch of this race?
For maximum strategic impact, your gift will be split between Theresa Greenfield's campaign and the DSCC.
Donate $5
Donate $10
Donate $25
Other Amount
Iowa is our best shot at taking back the Senate. If we fail, we’re facing another six years of McConnell and Ernst’s ""leadership."" That could mean six more years of folks with pre-existing conditions afraid of losing coverage, inaction on climate change, and our hardworking families suffering.
We cannot let that happen. We need to take back the Senate, and to do that we have to win here in Iowa. But we're running out of time to get our message out. Iowans are already voting, and McConnell and his allies will do -- and spend -- whatever it takes to win.
I'm running this campaign the right way -- without a dime in contributions from corporate PACs. That means I'm counting on grassroots supporters like you to step up right away. Pitch in $5 or more now to help flip this seat and take back the Senate.
Let's get to work,
Theresa

Medicare for All is driven by one simple mission statement: healthcare is a fundamental human right.
Every American should have access to high quality health care regardless of their income. Every year, American families see their premiums rise while their quality of care declines. Patients are dying because they are putting off medical visits they can’t afford. People are splitting prescription pills so they can make their outrageously high-priced, life-saving drugs last a little longer. We've had enough.
Medicare for All isn’t just the best path forward -- it’s the only path. Greedy insurance companies, drug manufacturers, and special interest groups have been standing in the way of real progress for too long -- we’re here to fight back. Click the button below to support our work:

But, every time they had a choice between America or Trump: they chose Trump.
We’re never going to forget it. We know you won’t, either.
They too must be defeated.
We’re putting this ad up in their home states, so their voters know their cowardice and betrayals.
Can you chip in $100, $25, or $13 today? We’re putting these ads up right now, and need your help, Alex.
Let’s beat Trump. And let’s beat Trumpism.

People are splitting prescription pills so they can make their outrageously high-priced, life-saving drugs last a little longer. We've had enough.

70,Booker for Senate,hello@corybooker.com,Cory is a key leader in the fight to end factory farms,"#
Team,
The larger that Big Ag gets, the more factory farms are running small, family farms out of business, raising prices for consumers at the supermarket, contributing to climate change, and even fueling the spread of disease and potential pandemics like the one we're currently experiencing.
Factory farms are bad for our farmers, consumers, animals, environment, and public health: that's why Cory introduced a bill to stop them.
Cory has been a key leader in the fight to end factory farms for good. His bill, The Farm System Reform Act, would ban construction of new concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO's), put the liability and costs of agricultural pollution, accidents, and disasters on the corporate farms instead of small farmers, and provide funding to those currently running CAFO's to transition to other forms of more sustainable agriculture.
With your help, we've been building public pressure to urge Congress to pass Cory's bill and stop the widespread harm of factory farms, but we need to keep it up.
If we're going to get Cory's bill passed and keep him fighting for our farmers, animals, environment, and public health, we need to re-elect him this November. Can you chip in $10 ahead of our August fundraising deadline to help us hit our end-of-month goal?

BREAKING: Donald Trump Jr. is flying back to Georgia tomorrow!
Alex, Donald Trump's visit to Georgia last week only made things worse for him and his ""favorite Senator,"" David Perdue, who disgraced himself by mocking Senator Kamala Harris.
So Donald Trump is sending his son back to Georgia tomorrow, days before Election Day, to try to reverse momentum and clean up the damage. It won't work, Alex.
Make a donation before Don Jr. arrives tomorrow to show him and his father that their visits to Georgia are only increasing Democratic momentum here.

Just like Don Jr.'s last trip didn't reverse Democratic momentum here. Nor did President Trump's previous two trips. Or visits from Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Attorney General Bill Barr.
Trump and the Republicans are terrified of Democrats winning in Georgia. They know if they lose here, they won't just lose the presidency -- they'll lose their Senate majority too. Alex, donate $25 right now to make sure that happens.
DONATE $25

73,Pete Buttigieg,info@wendydavisforcongress.com,Wendy's candidacy is an act of hope,"And right now, we could use your help
Hi Alex,
In the summer of 2013, I was just over a year into my first term as mayor of South Bend when the following words ignited a movement that would reverberate across the country:
""I'm rising on the floor today to humbly give voice to thousands of Texans who have been ignored.""
For the next 13 hours, countless Americans – including former President Barack Obama – pledged solidarity with Wendy Davis as she filibustered to stop a bill that would put unprecedented restrictions on abortion access.
That extremist bill from Texas Republicans, and the subsequent attempts to curb reproductive rights that it inspired in other state legislatures, created a frontal challenge to freedom in the Lone Star State. But as I often said when running for president, sometimes a challenge brings out the best in us. What is good in us.
It was certainly true for Wendy that day, and she's never stopped fighting for what's right – as a public servant, as a nonprofit founder, as a grandmother and, now, as a candidate for Congress in TX-21. I'm doing my part to help – along with a friend of mine I was fortunate to share a debate stage with. We set a goal to raise $50,000 by midnight tomorrow.
I know it's an audacious goal, but we're rallying around Wendy because she'll be a true fighter for Texans in Congress – and flipping this seat from red to blue is crucial to holding the Democratic majority. Can I count on you to pitch in $3 or more toward this goal to help Wendy win?
Running for office is an act of hope, Alex. I felt it every day I was out on the presidential campaign trail, and I know the amazing field of candidates who were out there with me would tell you the same thing.
I see that hope in Wendy's candidacy, too: in her resolve to leave this country a better place for her two granddaughters. In her courage to take on an extremist Republican incumbent who is entrenched among wealthy special interests. In her boldness to once again give voice to thousands of Texans who have been ignored.
Hope is our greatest engine of change. And supporting a run for office? Getting in a grassroots fight like this? That's an act of hope, too. Right now, with a recent poll showing Wendy down by just 1 point, we could use your help to hit this big goal – particularly with her opponent, Chip Roy, having a leg up with $2.3 million in TV ads bought and paid for by a conservative super PAC.
So please, make a contribution of $3 – whatever you can give before this big midnight deadline we've set – to help Wendy Davis flip TX-21 blue and protect our Democratic House majority.
Thank you,
Pete Buttigieg

74,Team DAGA,info@democraticags.org,Restore the Voting Rights Act,"The right to vote is under attack, and we need to fight together to restore it.
Alex, the right to vote is under attack: Roughly 2.7 million eligible Americans have been purged from the voter rolls at the GOP’s direction – and in recent primaries, many voters lucky enough to remain registered have waited five or six hours in line to vote. If we don’t act now, millions more could face this assault on their democratic right to vote.
That’s because although the Voting Rights Act of 1965 made enormous strides to help Black Americans vote, in 2013, the Supreme Court struck down critical parts of the VRA. Almost immediately, Republican leaders went to work blocking Black and other vulnerable voters from the ballot box. And their plan has been working.
Thankfully, a bill to restore the VRA has passed the House – but it has been sitting on Mitch McConnell’s desk for nearly 250 days. If we’re going to fight the GOP’s extreme voter suppression efforts, Democrats need to unite RIGHT NOW to demand the Senate restore the VRA. But we're still 372 signatures short of our can't-miss goal and noticed that you haven't signed yet.
Please, to ensure all Americans have access to the ballot box, we need you to take action now: Add your name to demand Congress restore the Voting Rights Act!

Alex –
The moment Joe Biden became our presumptive nominee for the presidency, the fight to end Donald Trump's destructive agenda and defeat his right-wing state allies finally kicked off in earnest.
Now, Vice President Biden is speaking out urgently about the stakes in that fight – and he's calling on Democrats everywhere to pitch in.
Noting that ""the clock is ticking"" and ""we don't have a moment to waste,"" the vice president pledged that if we win up and down the ballot this fall, ""we will not just rebuild this nation – we'll transform it."" Then he delivered a warning to every Democrat in America, declaring that if we want to see that transformation happen, ""We have to fight for it. We have to defend it. We have to earn it.""
In the wake of Vice President Biden's call to action, a coalition of progressive donors has stepped up to MATCH every donation to elect Democratic state legislators until our end-of-quarter fundraising deadline. From now until midnight tonight, all online gifts will have FIVE TIMES the impact for Democrats across the nation.

Vice President Biden is right, Alex: Nothing about these elections or our democracy is guaranteed, and nowhere is that truer than the battles taking place in legislatures across the nation.
These critical elections will decide so much about what America is and what we stand for as a people. They'll determine whether criminal justice reform advances or stalls; whether affordable health care is available to all or just the privileged few; whether our democracy values all voices or allows right-wing gerrymandering and voter suppression to silence the politically powerless.
Republicans are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to guarantee that they – not you – get to answer those critical questions, and these elections are our last chance to stop them.
Before the deadline: Pitch in $10 URGENTLY, and your gift will have FIVE TIMES the impact to help Democrats fight for every inch of this country >>

Our end-of-quarter deadline in just a few days is absolutely critical to the success of this campaign. Once the FEC reports are made public, our opponents will be able to see exactly how much we raised. And if we post unimpressive numbers -- they’ll know -- and double down on their effort to defeat Andy.

Andy won the first time around with a surge of grassroots support and we need to do it again. Donate $5 or whatever you can now to help make sure we keep Andy's critical seat.
This deadline is more important than ever because just last week national Republicans placed MILLIONS of more dollars in television ad buys in our district. They know that Andy doesn't take a dime from corporate PACs, so they think they can buy this race.
