Kathleen Williams for Congress
Thank you for joining the team!
When people put their faith in you, help build a movement bigger than yourself, when they look you in the eye and tell you they believe in you -- you don’t give up. You double down.
I'm proud to be running to be Montana’s lone representative in the U.S. Congress. Montanans want and deserve change. Let's do this together.
Help me build a winning campaign with a $10 or $25 contribution today.
From here, we’ll hit the campaign trail hard. I will be traveling back and forth across the state, meeting people of all political stripes and planning the future of our state together.
I need you with me in this effort! Chip in $10 or $25 right now.
Let’s win this,

Hi there,
Thanks for joining the team! My name is Kathleen Williams, and I’m proudly running to be Montana’s lone representative in the U.S. Congress.
I’m running so that everyday Montanans have someone to stand up for them. I come from a past rooted in hard work and I’m comfortable rolling up my sleeves to get a job done—whether that be in the rivers in rural Montana or passing legislation in the Montana Capitol as a state representative.
Now I want to hear from you. Can you take a moment to let me know what your most pressing issues are by quickly filling out a quick survey?
I have spent my 36-year career working with people of all political stripes to find win-win solutions to meet Montana’s most urgent needs, including affordable health care, good-paying jobs and protecting Montana's outdoor heritage.
Kathleen Williams: Candidate for U.S. Congress \(MT-AL\)
Since kicking off my campaign earlier this year, I’ve spent the last few months on the road talking with folks all across Montana. Farmers and ranchers. Nurses and teachers. Hunters and anglers. Tribal members and leaders. Because at the end of the day, we can’t solve our problems by staying in our own corners.
I’m excited for the rest of the journey and I look forward to keeping you updated from the campaign trail.
Right now, I really want to hear from you, though. Can you take a moment to let me know what’s on your mind? I can’t overstate how important it is to hear from you about what matters to you.
Thank you,
Kathleen Williams

Supporters,
Today, we remember and honor the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his contributions to our country. It’s no overstatement to say that he fundamentally changed the course of our country, and his impact lives on today.
“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”
Dr. King
Dr. King’s actions still hold important lessons we can’t forget: when we come together for the common good, we’re all better for it.
There is still work to be done to ensure everyone has equal, unrestricted access to the ballot box and beyond -- and that’s a mission I will take with me to Congress this November. I’m honored to have you along for the journey.
In remembrance of Dr. King,
Kathleen Williams

Here’s the truth, summer is the most difficult fundraising season for any campaign -- even though it’s our most critical.
And with July quickly coming to an end, we need to close the $15,289 gap that still stands between us and our end-of-month fundraising drive. Will you chip in $15 to help us catch up to where we should be today?

Unless we get a second wind of support, there’s no path that will get us to our goal before July ends. That means we’ll have to make serious budget cuts that will affect our online ads, our radio airtime and even our staffing.
That would mean we’re losing out on key resources to get Kathleen elected. But we still have time before Friday’s midnight deadline. Will you rush in a contribution of any amount to help us fund our program throughout the summer?
Thank you,

Please be safe and follow CDC guidance during the coronavirus outbreak. As our country works through this difficult time, please join me in reaching out to those in need or who are feeling isolated - we are all in this together.
This has been a whirlwind of a year for Kathleen and the team, and we wanted to update you on how far we’ve come since we launched our campaign last year.
But we’re not hitting the brakes just yet. We need to continue to keep up our historic momentum all the way until November 3rd. Your $10 donation helps us keep the entire campaign running at full speed. Will you chip in right now?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Here’s where 2020 has taken us so far:
1. Since March, we’ve been tied with our Trump-endorsed, Republican opponent Matt Rosendale 47-47. This is anybody’s race to win -- and to lose.
2. We SWEPT the Montana Democratic Primaries this June, taking in 89.5% of the vote. This was an astounding message that our supporters are ready to fight all the way to November.
3. Our race was added to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s Red to Blue list because they believe we’re one of the BEST pickup opportunities in the country.
And those are just some of the many moments that have shifted and changed this race. We’re not done fighting yet, and with the summer being our busiest season yet, what we do now will determine whether we’re successful on election night.
That’s why it’s all hands on deck at Team Kathleen. If you’re ready to jump into the race and help elect Kathleen, rush in $10, or $30, right now. It’s supporters like you who will help bring us a historic victory this November.
Thank you,

Politics right now are divisive. I’ve worked my entire career to bridge such divides. Right now, honesty, independence and forward-thinking are sorely needed in D.C. and I’m ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work finding our common ground so we can move forward on solutions for Montana and our nation.

These goals are important because they fund all the work we do digitally to meet Montanans -- especially when we can’t meet them in person.
We can’t jeopardize our resources by taking a back seat. We’re reaching out to every supporter we can to build our ability to keep our ads running and keep in touch with the communities that will carry us to Washington in November.
But our chances of making that possible disappear with any goal for which we fall short. Help us close out May strong by sending in $10 before Sunday’s deadline.

Team -- Thank you for the incredible hard work you’ve put in this past month.
Not only did we surpass our fundraising goal for February, but we’re now standing on stronger footing as we move closer to Election Day.
Everything we do from hitting the road, meeting voters, sending out flyers and running online ads is powered entirely by your donations. Because of you, we’re well on our way to building the strongest campaign Montana has ever seen.
For that, I want to say thank you.
But, the most important thing to me in running this race is listening to Montanans. That’s why we spend time on the road reaching as many communities as possible. Now we have another opportunity to ensure that your voice is heard.
Take my new survey for March, and let me know what’s the top issue you fight for or face every day. Your response shapes my agenda as we move closer to November. We take every chance we get to listen to the voters, and this is one of the most powerful tools we have.
Thank you,

It’s official, we won the primary!
We are now the official Democratic campaign that will stand against Matt Rosendale in November’s historic election. But already he and his allies are misrepresenting me and my record.
It’s time for the final sprint.
We’re on track to make history in Montana, but it’s not going to be an easy road; we’re up against a mountain of dark money resources. Will you chip in to help us fend off whatever outside national Republican Super PACs throw at us to defeat our campaign?

Republicans are scared that one of their own is going to lose this election. They’re worried that a real independent leader for Montana is going to make decisions that put Montanans first and will find solutions by working across the aisle.
Let’s make sure that their fears come true. It’s not an easy road to Washington, but it’s one we’ll travel together. Help us build a winning path ahead by chipping in $12.

Kathleen Williams for Congress
Team,
Today, we’re one month away from November’s General Election.
This election will help determine the future of Montana. While Kathleen continues to fight for small businesses, public lands and protecting our communities’ health and safety, our Republican opponent would rather fight for his insurance donors.
But right now, our race is still neck and neck. We are just 31 days away from the most important elections of our lifetimes. Will you help change the tide of the race and push Kathleen forward with a $15 donation today?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50
$100 $250 Other
Kathleen is ready to take her years of experience to be Montana’s only voice in the House. But national GOP groups are spending millions of dollars to muddy the waters and make Montana sound more like Washington.
Let’s show them that no dollar amount they throw at us will change this fact of the race: Kathleen is the best choice for our future. Help build our path forward with a $15 donation today.
Thank you,
Blake Thompson

Let me tell you when I saw this headline, my jaw dropped.
Senators used their position of power to sell off millions of dollars worth of stock while our nation faces the worst public health crisis we’ve faced in decades.
Enough is enough! It’s time to put a stop to the status quo and elect a leader who will fight corruption on Day 1. I know Kathleen is that leader, and I need your help to send her independent voice to Congress in November. Will you sign the pledge today?

Kathleen Williams for Congress
This is downright corrupt:
This is what happens when we let corrupt public officials lead. Instead of finding solutions to the worst pandemic in decades, four senators sold off millions of dollars worth of stock to benefit their own personal fortunes.
This is exactly the kind of lack of ethics Kathleen has stood against since Day 1.
No matter what branch of government, it’s up to us to elect public officials dedicated to ending corruption everywhere. That’s why we need to send a clear message that we stand for public service, not profiteering
Will you add your name to our team's pledge to send real and authentic leadership like Kathleen’s to Congress?
Kathleen’s independent and honest voice is what we need fighting for Montanans. She’ll put our best interests first, not her pocketbook.
We need Kathleen’s leadership on Capitol Hill now. If you’re ready to elect a corruption busting, resource-saving representative, add your name to our pledge to send Kathleen to Congress!
Thank you,

Kathleen Williams for Congress
Right now, our country is facing a healthcare crisis. What makes that even worse? Soaring prescription drug prices.
When it’s cheaper to get prescription drugs from Canada, you know we have a problem. There’s no good reason why the richest country in the world is forcing people to choose between filling their prescriptions and keeping the lights on.
But that’s the reality for countless Montanans. We need action. We need 5,000 of Kathleen’s grassroots team to sign her newest petition: Demand the Senate take action to lower prescription drug costs.
Critical drugs to manage diabetes, address heart disease, and shrink tumors all continue to have skyrocketing costs. Some even cost over $20,000 for one month’s supply.
There’s no more room to just sit by. Sick Montanans need advocates and it’s up to us to ensure their voices are heard by raising ours.
Stand with Montanans today. Add your name to Kathleen’s petition. Let’s lower prescription drug prices together.

Folks, November’s elections will be the most important in recent memory.
For us in Big Sky Country, that means rejecting politicians who’d rather be buddy-buddy with industry insiders, than protect our communities and public lands. That’s why we have to stand with Kathleen Williams as she fights to be a representative for the people.
This race is one of the most competitive in the country. We need to all work together to keep Kathleen’s campaign running strong as she works to flip Montana’s lone House seat from red to blue. Rush in $25 right now to make it possible.

Democrats are facing a flood of opposition. Not only is the Montana GOP hustling every donor they can find, they’ve welcomed in the same type of Washington GOP groups that attacked me two years ago to tilt the election in Maryland Matt’s favor.
We can’t let their efforts go unopposed. That’s why we need your $25 today.
People are stronger than the big special interests. That’s why I’m joining the fight and mobilizing as many people as possible to get Kathleen elected in November. The primaries are over, Kathleen will be our champion in November’s elections and she needs a strong grassroots team standing with her.
Will you stand with me and Kathleen and fight to elect her to Congress in 2020? Chip in today.

There’s a lot of lies being spread about me and my record, so I wanted to tell you why I'm fighting to get to Congress.
As a natural resource expert and dedicated public servant, it’s been my honor to work with so many Montanans to balance the needs of our economy and communities with the importance of protecting our storied outdoor heritage. I’ve worked to reduce the amount of money in campaigns, cut taxes and red tape, help farmers and ranchers, and create jobs.
Maryland Matt on the other hand would rather have you ignore the facts and listen to falsehoods about me that his Super PAC donors are helping him spread. We need to set things straight and we need your $20 to make it happen. Will you donate right now?

I worked to expand access to quality healthcare. Matt Rosendale pushed junk insurance plans that don’t even cover pre-existing conditions.
The numbers don’t lie: Maryland Matt is in the business of turning his political connections into gaining more power and influence over the way Montanans live their lives.
If Maryland Matt wants to go back to the DC area, he should do it on his dime, not ours. Can I count on you to support me and my campaign today, and stop Rosendale’s march to Washington with a $20 donation?

With early voting having kicked off and absentee ballots being sent out to mailboxes in a matter of days, the election has already started.
That means we’re running out of time and resources to reach the crucial undecided voters who will make the difference in this race.
Although our race is tied, it’ll be the voices in the middle who will make it clear who they believe will serve their best interests in Congress. I’m running to represent the voice of the people -- my Republican opponent is running to represent his wealthy donors.

1. 84% of Montanans say the environment is a critically important issue to consider when supporting public officials
2. 75% of Montanans consider themselves “conservationists”
3. ⅔ of Montanans believe in preserving our public spaces, not selling them off to the highest bidder

Last Tuesday, we celebrated the 100-year anniversary of the 19th Amendment which gave many women the right to vote, and on Wednesday we will be celebrating Women’s Equality Day.
These celebrations are both important reminders of how far we as a nation have come, but that the work to achieve equality is far from over.
Women still face workplace sexual harassment, discrimination, and are paid just $0.79 for every $1 their male counterpart makes -- and that number is even lower among women of color. Even now, the Equal Rights Amendment, a landmark piece of legislation, is collecting dust on Mitch McConnell’s desk.
Let’s make our voices heard loud and clear that we want to achieve equality under the law. ADD YOUR NAME: Demand that the Senate ratify the Equal Rights Amendment.
ADD YOUR NAME
Protecting the rights of women shouldn’t be partisan. Instead, far-right extremists are simply ignoring all the ways women are treated unfairly and tuning out the calls of women to make things better.
But we can ensure that they get back to listening to the people they represent.
ADD YOUR NAME: Be one of the 5,000 supporters we need to sign on to my petition. We have to keep moving forward to make things better for all women. If you agree, add your name to my petition today.
ADD YOUR NAME
And, in this election, let’s elect Montana’s second Congresswoman to the US House!

Straight off our major win in Montana’s Democratic Primary, we just got word that our race is tightening.
Montana’s At-Large district was just named one of the most competitive in the country and moved from Likely Republican to Lean Republican by The Cook Political Report!!!
Even the political experts see Kathleen’s race tightening as we work overtime to close the gap between Kathleen and Matt Rosendale.
The GOP in Montana see the writing on the wall and know we have the greatest chance we've ever had to send real Montana leadership to Washington. But they’re going to say anything to win. Will you chip in $10 to ensure Kathleen’s November victory?

Maryland Matt Rosendale has nowhere else to turn. His dark money support can only take him so far. They’re going to lie about Kathleen’s record all summer into the fall and try to reinvent Rosendale’s because they have nothing else. Well, Montanans know and deserve better.
That’s why we’re working non-stop to get Kathleen’s message to as many people as possible. It’s going to be a challenge now that we can’t venture into the communities we love. But that won’t stop us from getting the job done.
We need you on our side to make sure Kathleen can take her seat in Congress and DEFEAT Matt Rosendale in November. Will you donate to help support our movement today?

I’ll make this quick, will you send in just $5 to help us wrap up our final, pre-primary fundraising goal? We need to raise another $457.
We still have time to get our message out to voters who may be personally dropping off their ballots, or (safely) voting in person at their election office. It’s an exciting day for democracy and our campaign.
Tonight, we can bring home a victory, but we need your support to make that happen.
Thank you so much!
Kathleen Williams

P.S. Don’t forget to vote by 8 pm! If you still have your ballot, use this link to find your precinct number and then go here to determine your drop-off location (by precinct) and make sure your voice is heard. If you don’t have a ballot, you can still register or re-register and vote in person today by 8 pm at elections offices (be safe!) if you’ve lived in Montana at least 30 days. If you have questions, please call or text 406-272-4046.

Friends,
We’re losing time to reach our final $20,000 goal before our midnight deadline.
We need to raise every cent as we fight to reach crucial voters who will help us get ahead of Maryland Matt’s dark money-funded campaign.
Because Montanans deserve a true, independent leader in Congress.
But we’re rushing to beat the clock before our fundraising totals are locked in for the month. Just $1,098 stands between us and our goal. Will you donate $10 before tonight?
Thank you so much!

Friends,
At the end of the month, Kathleen and the team will be submitting their final, end-of-quarter report before November’s General Election and we want to submit this one with a bang.
We’re looking to add $35,000 to our budget numbers before our September 30th deadline and Kathleen needs your help to make it happen. Help us kick things off early with a $30 contribution today.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50
$100 $250 Other
This one of the last times our numbers will be public for everyone to see before the General Election -- and that means the Washington Super PACs pumping up Maryland Matt’s campaign will see exactly where we stand.
That’s why we need to make sure we send in our strongest report yet. Not only that, but this is also a prime opportunity to get in the final resources we’ll need in the final weeks of the campaign as soon as we enter October.
So help Kathleen and the entire team send in a strong report that reflects the growing momentum behind their campaign. Will you make a donation of any size right now?
CHIP IN $30 HERE

Matt Rosendale has just released a new ad smearing Kathleen’s record of service in Montana just 28 days ahead of November’s General Election.
Help us respond by getting 150 Rapid Response Donations TODAY!
* * *
Unlike Maryland Matt, we don’t need to greenlight falsehoods or use smear tactics in our ads to win this campaign.
All we have to do is listen to the people of Montana.
Montanans are tired of Maryland Matt trying to turn our state into the D.C. swamp. And they’re tired of him twisting our fight for all Montanans into an attempt to paint Kathleen as a partisan extremist. It’s an old tactic that he thinks will take him to Congress, and it's just not true.
But don’t just ask us, see what the Bozeman Daily Chronicle has to say:
“Rosendale’s campaign seeks to paint Williams as a liberal who will ally herself with extreme left elements of Congress. Her record tells a different story.”
Matt Rosendale is grasping at straws because he knows distorting Kathleen’s record is his only chance to win. Help us set the record straight now that Matt Rosendale has just released his next slate of ads with a $20 donation.

It’s not every day that your former opponent spends $250,000 of his own money to bankroll your opposition. But that’s just a regular day for Greg Gianforte.
Greg Gianforte and special interest groups know that we are outraising most of our opponents in Montana. That’s why they’re asking every deep-pocketed donor to get involved and are scraping the bottom of the barrel.
Let’s make sure it stays that way.
Right now, our opponents have a lot of wiggle room with Gianforte’s newest $250,000 lifeline. We’ve got to match that strength. Can we count on our top supporters to help us keep ahead of the newest influx of cash?

Greg is happy to play the hard-working Montanan, but he doesn’t know that the hard-working Montanan doesn’t have $250,000 to burn. Instead, we work hard for every penny. Countless Montanans live paycheck to paycheck, deciding when to fill prescriptions, pay for college or even get food on the table.
That’s who Kathleen’s fighting for -- not Washington elites.
Our grassroots team is supporting Kathleen with their hard-earned money, and we couldn’t be prouder. Come join us today, by chipping in $15 right now.

Hi everyone,
I’m Cora Neumann, a former Candidate for Montana’s U.S. Senate seat, and I proudly endorse Kathleen Williams in her race to represent Montana's lone US House seat.
Before I tell you why, will you pitch in $30 to Kathleen’s campaign to send a proven leader to Congress? In just a few months, we can send her to Washington to fight for us, our communities, and our public lands. This is only possible with a strong grassroots team standing with her. Will you donate today?
Throughout my career, I have worked with and mentored women leaders -- from local health practitioners to First Ladies -- in their efforts to serve our communities. At the State Department, I worked on women's economic empowerment and leadership in the US and worldwide.
Both personally and professionally, I am committed to seeing more women’s voices at the table. It’s good for the economy, for society, and for the future of our planet.
I also know a special leader when I see one. That is why I am very proud to endorse Kathleen Williams for her run for Montana’s lone House seat.
If you’re ready to send an independent voice to Washington who will put Montana first, then it’s time to elect Kathleen Williams. Join me in endorsing Kathleen today by chipping in any amount to support her campaign.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

$50 $100

Having women in Congress means effective policies will see the light of day more often. In fact, during this COVID-19 response, we are seeing some of the most rapid, comprehensive and effective responses come from women leaders.
We need Kathleen fighting for Big Sky Country on Capitol Hill now more than ever. Join me in endorsing a clear choice for our state by chipping in $10, $27, or any amount today.
Thank you,
Cora Neumann

The current public health and economic challenges further remind us that we need strong, principled leadership in Washington. So, we are continuing to work hard, with your help, to raise the resources needed to get there.
At the end of March, we will be submitting all of our fundraising numbers for our first public report of 2020.
This next Tuesday, everything we’ve done in the past three months will be out in the open for every eye to see. Let’s make sure we send in a report that will make every person who is a part of this campaign proud.
We’re looking to boost our fundraising numbers to keep outraising our opponents. Can you give $25 today to our $20,000 March 31st end-of-quarter goal?

We’ve seen a groundswell of supporters join our campaign from Troy to Broadus and Plentywood to Darby, but we have to turn that support into donations in order to show our opponents the strength of our movement.
Please chip in your $25 today and let’s keep our momentum going. Time’s ticking, and there are only 8 days left.

Kathleen has gotten results. She’s protected care for cancer patients, fought against insurance discrimination and surprise medical bills, and helped extend coverage to over 90,000 Montanans. She already has a plan to further expand healthcare affordability and access for Montanans when she gets to Congress. No matter pre-existing conditions or income, expanding coverage and access is one of Kathleen’s top priorities.

For Kathleen, fighting for our public lands isn’t political -- it’s personal.
As a natural resource expert and former State Representative, Kathleen has spent her time managing America’s most important resources like clean water, fresh air and our valued open spaces. She understands just how critical the role public lands play in keeping Montana’s communities vibrant.

Instead of seeing our outdoors as a resource that needs proper management and care, Montana Republicans have a different vision -- they see land that’s ripe for development.
That’s why Kathleen is running to defeat our millionaire, East Coast developer opponent who’s pushed for the transfer of public lands -- all to make them easier to sell off to the highest bidder.
We need to fiercely defend Montana’s outdoor heritage for future generations. If you agree, chip in $25 to send Kathleen to Washington to ensure we conserve our public lands for future generations.

Friends,
Nurses across the country are putting their lives on the line as they battle the COVID-19 pandemic.
With National Nurses Day this week, we want to let nurses all across the country know how deeply we appreciate their work fighting on the frontlines of this public health crisis.
Will you sign our campaign’s thank you card to nurses in Montana and around the country?
Sign The Card
Even beyond our current crisis, nurses are critical to making sure our nation is healthy and cared for. These deeply committed healthcare professionals made it their responsibility to lend their services to every community.
Montanans recognize hard work and now it’s up to us to show our appreciation for nurses.
Will you add your name to Kathleen’s thank you card to help us celebrate National Nurses Day this week?
Thank you so much for your support,
Team Kathleen

Help Protect Montana’s Public Lands!
The Montana GOP is ready to sell off our public lands to the highest bidder.
Will you stand up to their plan by signing Kathleen’s petition to PROTECT our public lands?
* * *
Team,
Whether it’s Greg Gianforte who openly opposes funding key conservation legislation or Matt Rosendale, an out-of-state developer who campaigned on transferring our public lands, Montana’s GOP is drafting up plans for their next attempt to attack our public lands, tarnish Montana’s outdoor legacy and block access roads and trails from the public.
We need to make our voices heard that Montana’s public lands are NOT for sale. Add your name to our petition today calling for full funding and support for our public spaces. We’re looking to add 5,000 names to this petition -- will you be one of them?
Kathleen Williams for Congress
The current administration has a record of removing protections from vast expanses of public lands, and we need to stand up and act if we want to secure our outdoor heritage for the next generation.
It happened in Utah. It’s happening in Arizona. And unless we stay vigilant, Montana could be next on the chopping block.
We’re looking for 5,000 signatures to help strengthen our case to the GOP, industrialists and anyone looking to wreak havoc on our public lands. Will you join your voice with ours by adding your name to protect our public lands?
Thank you for taking a stand,
Team Kathleen

Special interests are hoping to see Kathleen’s campaign fail. Out-of-state interests are pouring money into this race to see a candidate allow skyrocketing health care costs, eliminate the Affordable Care Act and work for the lobbyists’ best interests.
But our grassroots campaign can show them that we’re stronger than they are. Will you help Kathleen win the opportunity to represent Montana by helping us raise the final $6,030 we need before primary voting ends on Tuesday?

Team,
When August ends, we’ll be on the final sprint to the election. At the end of September, our final fundraising report before the election will be due and we want to make a bold statement.
With attacks ads, dark-money spending, and million-dollar corporate PACs aimed right at us, we want to show the true power of the people. But there isn’t much time to do it.
That’s why we’re aiming high for August’s fundraising goal to help us bump up our numbers before we hit September. Will you help us show the power of our campaign by helping us raise $25,000 before August 31st?
CHIP IN HERE
Montana is the top prize of special interests in 2020. They see the growing people-funded movement to elect Kathleen, and they know that she won’t toe their line in Congress.
They’ve put their might behind their efforts to win and they’re depending on their dark money dollars and mega-donors to outwork and outpace our small-dollar, grassroots movement. We won’t let them stop us.
But we need to keep up the energy to finish up August as strong as possible. Will you send in $30 to help raise $25,000 before Monday’s midnight deadline?
Thank you,
Jeff Allen

Team, it’s unimaginable to think this is happening now.
Right when families need health insurance to cover costs and keep them healthy, the GOP is actively fighting to eradicate the Affordable Care Act.
But we can stop them in their tracks. Send in your donation to help me win Montana’s ONLY House seat and I’ll start fighting for American families on day ONE.
I’ve already fought tooth and nail to extend coverage to over 90,000 Montanans, and I’ll do the same in Congress. I have a record of real results in protecting care for cancer patients, fighting against insurance discrimination and surprise medical bills, and advocating for better, more affordable health care.

Politico Headline
Right now, Republican-controlled states are ganging up to jeopardize healthcare for over 20 million Americans, directly fueled by support from the current administration.
Instead of expanding coverage, their solution to the rising cost of health care? Put millions at risk of being kicked off of their insurance.
We need to elect leaders who are willing to stand up and protect coverage for millions of Americans. We need leaders like Kathleen. That’s where you come in. Will you chip in to help her get to Congress and lower costs and increase coverage? Not the other way around.

Countless American families depend on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to lower costs and prevent insurance companies from taking advantage of them and their health conditions.
But to some, eliminating the ACA means that their insurance buddies will be more than happy to fund their campaigns.
We need to stand up to bullies willing to strip coverage to line their pockets. Rush in a $10 contribution so that Kathleen Williams can stand up against them.
Thank you,

Despite the economic and public health challenges we're facing, you can feel a change coming. The weather is warming, snow is receding and the migratory birds are returning.
Spring is a time of change. As all things begin to emerge from winter, Montanans too have the chance to make their own choice that’ll change the path and future of our state.
Will we continue to be misrepresented in Congress by out of touch public officials looking to make a quick dollar and climb the political ladder? Or will we stand up, together, against self-serving, broken politicians?
I’m ready to actually fight for Montana’s best interests in Congress. In 2020 there’s too much on the line to elect another political climber to office. If you’re ready to spring our state into the future, please consider chipping in $20.20 right now.

Kathleen Williams for Congress
I’m dedicated to making sure Kathleen Williams wins big in 2020, which is why I wanted to send you another message.
Voting in Montana is underway, meaning the General Election is happening right now. We’re running out of time to ensure that Kathleen will get the nod as our lone voice in Congress.
But Matt Rosendale is feeling the pressure. Just last week, he and his dark money allies launched TWO attack ads that lie about Kathleen’s record. The truth? She’s fighting for more affordable healthcare, tax cuts for the middle class and she’s ready to do it in a bipartisan way.
Let’s make sure Matt Rosendale doesn’t get anywhere close to Congress by chipping in $17 to Kathleen’s campaign -- $1 for every day we have left before November 3rd!

Our Montana way of life is at stake in this election. Matt Rosendale is happy to take the voices of his wealthy donors to Congress and turn our state into a playground for Washington elites and developers looking to make a quick buck off our land and our people.
But we can stop that from happening. Chip in any amount today to support Kathleen as we enter into the final days of the election.
Thank you,

Kathleen Williams for Congress
There’s really no two ways about it: a woman should have the freedom and privacy to make her own health care decisions without any interference -- especially from her own government.
At a time when women's rights are under attack, it’s more vital than ever that we take a stand to defend access to critical health care services.
Add your name to our petition today to tell Congress that our network is ready to defend a woman’s right to health care! There’s no “if”s, “and”s or “but”s about it.
Protect Women’s Health Care TODAY
A woman’s health care decisions should only be made between her and her doctor. In a free and just country, our government should have zero say in the decisions we make about our bodies.
But right now, that’s not the case. Scores of politicians in Washington are using health care as a political football instead of caring about the health and wellbeing of women in their own districts.
It’s time for action.
Will you add your voice with our entire team to send a clear message that we won’t stop fighting for women’s unobstructed access to critical health care services they rely on?
Thanks for making a difference
