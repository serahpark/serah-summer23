# Primary Season is Over in the 4th!
### Help Me Reach My End of The Month Goal!
Dear Patriot,
If you haven’t gotten my messages, I’m Leon Benjamin—a black conservative pastor, veteran, a surrogate for President Trump, and I’m an unapologetic Conservative!
I am running against Socialist gun-grabber Donald McEachin, who stands alongside Racist Joe Biden, in Virginia’s 4th District!
We have an urgent fundraising deadline less than a week away!
At the end of the month, the fundraising quarter will end and we need to give a strong showing to demonstrate our legitimacy as a campaign!
Will you help me hit my goal?
Please donate today and help me get over the line!
*YES, I WILL HELP YOU MEET YOUR GOAL*
I was born and raised in district in Richmond, Virginia.
Richmond has always been my home and its where I am raising my two wonderful kids with my wife of 28 years, Maria.
When our country went to war in the Persian Gulf War, my country needed me. As a Navy reservist, I was deployed to fight for freedom. I served on the USS John F. Kennedy.
Many brave men and women put their lives on the line beside me in service to our country. Our freedom was won by the blood of patriots.
Freedom is never free.
After I got home, the Lord called me into the ministry.
I’ve pastored a church here in Richmond for more than a decade. God has called me to serve the people of Richmond.
I’ve also had the honor of representing the President as a minority surrogate, arguing for the President’s agenda on Fox News and other cable news outlets.
I’ve always been a strong supporter of the President!
Socialist McEachin is nothing but a rabid anti-Trumper trying to undermine him at all costs! He doesn’t care about his district.
I’ve watched as Democrats take the black vote for granted and time and time again pass over our inner-city communities. The only time they remotely care is when it’s election time.
Black lives don’t matter to them. Black votes matter.
That’s all I am to Racist Joe Biden.
That’s why God called me to run for Congress! We need true conservative leadership in Washington!
We need someone who will fight for OUR values!
Will you help me beat Socialist McEachin?
Please donate today to my campaign and help me stop Socialism!
*STOP SOCIALISM!*
This country is burning as Socialists are attempting a full-scale insurrection! And Socialists like McEachin are fanning the flames!
In Seattle, Leftist terrorists occupied six city blocks and declared they seceded from the United States to establish their own communist state!
The Leftist mayor of Seattle turned tail and ran! She ordered police to stand down and let them have the precinct! Now, they’ve erected walls!
They built a wall, are violently enforcing border security, screening everyone coming in and out with ID checks, and have armed guards with AR-15s and AK-47s patrolling the wall!
These same communists were screaming racist because Trump wanted a strong border with Mexico—and they’ve gone and done the same thing.
These Leftists are also terrorizing their own people. They are exhorting businesses, beating anyone up that doesn’t agree with them, and are violently enforcing their own laws:
The official also added that leaders in the anti-cop zone are ""starting to extort money from the local businesses within the border for 'protection.'""
Rapper Raz Simone also declared himself warlord. This is a full-scale Marxist dystopia ruled by a violent warlord and armed guards!
Now, crimes are being committed left and right in the autonomous zone and the police have not been allowed access inside to get to these calls:
“Our calls for service have more than tripled,” she told reporters. “These are responses to emergency calls — rapes, robberies, and all sorts of violent acts that have been occurring in the area that we’re not able to get to.”
There have been two shootings in the last 48 hours alone in the autonomous zone! This is what the world looks like without cops!
We need our police and this Leftist scum are trying to completely abolish them!
I will stand with President Trump for our law enforcement and against this insanity!
Will you help me?
Please donate today and send a conservative warrior that will always Back the Blue!
*BACK THE BLUE!*
Now, other cities are trying to overthrow our police and spread this Socialist insurrection!
In Washington DC, protestors tried to form an autonomous zone and pull down a statue of Andrew Jackson!
In my native Richmond, the Lee statue has become a hotspot of armed, violent protestors to gather! They’ve started trying to make barricades with cars around the statues!
This is just disgusting and needs to be stopped immediately!
Governor Blackface Northam has YET to address this! He and Socialist McEachin are looking the other way at this sickening violence and just pretending it isn’t happening!
They don’t care about black lives. Dozens of black police officers have been killed and wounded across America by leftist terrorists and anarchists! Not a single Democrat said a word.
Hundreds of black men and women have been shot in the last few weeks in Chicago and Baltimore. Not a single word of condemnation.
Here in Richmond, our black community is victimized by drug and gang violence. And the entire police force has to fight a bunch of rioters every night as black men and women die!
These Socialist Democrats don’t care about black lives: all they care about are black votes. They are fanning the flames of violence and watching America burn to the ground—all so they can win an election!
This is disgusting and evil!
Our Richmond police headquarters was attacked by an armed gang that threw bombs, bottles, and bricks at police! They attempted to burn down the HQ. Luckily, our police stood their ground.
Meanwhile, our Leftist mayor had his apartment complex broken into by a crowd of protestors! And he had an army of private security to force them out!
What a disgusting hypocrite! He wants to disarm us, take away all police, and hires private security?!
It’s time to kick these hypocrites out of office!
Help me take back this district from Socialist McEachin! Donate today and help me win!
STOP SOCIALISM!*
The end of the fundraising quarter is at the end of month! We have less than a week to hit our fundraising goal!
We are trying to raise $30,000 dollars! So far, we’ve raised $27,563!
We’re so close! Can you help push us over the edge?
Please donate today and help me take back our country!

Securing the Border from Your Hometown
Published on February 2, 2020
Joe Walz
U.S. House of Representatives Texas CD-22 Candidate
There is no doubt in my mind or in the laws of physics that a wall is an effective method of preventing someone or something from going from point A to point B.
What else do we need to fund? What other programs need reform or abolishment? One of the biggest ways to stop chain migration and remove the proverbial carrot would be to stop birth-right citizenship and maternity tourism. These things subvert the intent of our federal immigration laws and I will fight to stop them.
Technology exists to significantly reduce the burden on our men and women at Customs and Border Patrol. We need to equip the USCBP with these forms of deterrent and detection. That all helps, but what if your Sheriff could start removing illegal immigrants him or herself?
I present to you the Immigration and Customs Enforcement 287g Program. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) 287(g) Program enhances the safety and security of communities by creating partnerships with state and local law enforcement agencies to identify and remove aliens who are amenable to removal from the United States.
Put simply, the 287g program gives a law enforcement agency the equipment and authorizations to interview immigrants, check Department of Homeland Security databases, issue detainers to hold individuals until ICE takes custody, enter information into the ICE case management system, and issue the Notice to Appear – the first steps required for removal.
A Sheriff could literally start the deportation process from within his jail. A proactive Sheriff could even arrange a voluntary removal, to include arranging transportation back to home country for the individual. Sheriff Louderback of Jackson County, Texas has enrolled his county and doubles down by giving presentations on the program to various groups like the one Fort Bend Republican Patriots Club received from him a few years ago. Perhaps that’s why Sheriff Louderback is often seen with President Donald Trump in The White House.
Sheriffs that are opposed to 287g use inflated figures and fictional numbers to make it seem like not enrolling in the program has its merits in fiscal responsibility. These notions could not be further from the truth. The cost of illegal immigrant crimes, societal costs, and the damage done to families victimized by criminal illegal aliens far outweigh the costs presented by soft on immigration Sheriffs.
My county Sheriff briefed his constituents at multiple events that he was not going to participate. He stood by and played a video he produced - instead of telling the people directly what his intent was and why. Look at the examples below, both deported after being detained by a law enforcement office enrolled in 287g.
New Jersey – On May 23, 2019, a Designated Immigration Officer from the Monmouth County, NJ 287(g) Program encountered a citizen of Mexico charged with luring-enticing a child, sex assault victim under 13, lewdness, endangering-sexual conduct with a child. The subject entered the United States on an unknown date and location without inspection. The Monmouth County 287(g) Program placed an immigration detainer, Form I-247A, and warrant on the subject who will be served a Notice to Appear.
South Carolina – On March 13, 2019, a Designated Immigration Officer from the Charleston County, SC Sheriff’s Office 287(g) Program encountered a citizen of Mexico who was charged with criminal sexual conduct with a minor second degree – victim 11 to 14 years of age. The individual had previously been removed. The Charleston County 287(g) Program placed an immigration detainer, Form I-247A, and warrant on the subject who will be served with a Notice of Intent/Decision to Reinstate Prior Order.
The State of Texas tasks elected Sheriffs with the duty to uphold public safety within their county. When every other Republican Sheriff in the vicinity of Fort Bend County is participating, one must ask how is it that these smaller counties with less revenue and less illegal immigrant crime are able to participate. I am not lost as to why the democrat Sheriffs are not participating. That is what makes the GOP known for being tough on illegal immigration. We as a party tend to be more proactive and less sympathetic to the illegal, and more concerned with the welfare of citizens and LEGAL immigrants we serve.
This would serve as a proactive manner of dealing with human trafficking and drug trafficking occurring right here in Fort Bend. If the families only knew that there was a way those things could have been prevented from within our own county’s departments.
No new officers must be hired. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement pays a major portion of the detention cost. Statistics from counties like Gwinnett County, Georgia saw a long-term reduction in average daily jail population directly correlating with their 287g participation. That long-term savings is how you judge whether a program is fiscally sensible or not. Business-minded folks know, sometimes you must spend a little money to make money. 287g fits this model perfectly. For the costs of travel and hotels, a Sheriff could reduce his long-term average jail population. There’s the nugget of gold. Not to mention, the enhancement of public safety in the jurisdiction.
As the Representative for Texas’ 22nd District in 2020 – I will assist our new Sheriff by filling the gap between the cost to house an inmate and what ICE reimburses the jail. Nullifying that excuse could encourage thousands of agencies to participate. Keeping in mind there may be some work for the jails to work to reduce that cost per day figure as well.

2,"For months, Donald Trump downplayed the risk of the global health pandemic, and now he's desperate to find someone to blame...
""Trump move to end WHO funding amid coronavirus fight criticized""
–NBC News, April 15
Alex –
First it was the media.
Then it was Democratic governors.
Now, it's the World Health Organization.
For months, Donald Trump downplayed the risk of the global health pandemic – even calling the whole thing Democrats' ""new hoax"" at rallies – as he ignored briefings telling him to prepare for the worst.
Now, he's desperately looking for someone to blame for his failure to act – and his latest move is to cut $400 MILLION from the World Health Organization, right in the middle of the pandemic.
This is absolutely enraging, Alex: We CANNOT give Trump and his state Republican enablers a pass for yet again endangering millions of Americans' health by cutting funding to the only global organization capable of responding to this pandemic.
Alex, we need your voice urgently: Speak out now and DEMAND that Congress reverse Trump's order and restore funding for the W.H.O. >>
ADD MY NAME →
Prominent voices are already joining this call. Bill Gates says Trump's decision is ""as dangerous as it sounds"" because if the W.H.O.'s work on coronavirus is cut back, ""no other organization can replace them.""
The editor-in-chief of The Lancet, a prominent medical journal, went even further – calling the funding cuts ""a crime against humanity"" and warning that ""every scientist, every health worker, every citizen must resist and rebel against this appalling betrayal of global solidarity.""
There's no way to sugarcoat this: Lives will be lost if we turn our backs on science and let Trump's business-as-usual prevail. That's why we have to mobilize and reject Trump's W.H.O. cuts now.
Speak out IMMEDIATELY to urge Congress to reject Trump's W.H.O. cuts, before his incompetence gets even more Americans killed >>

3,"Are you and I ""pro-crime?"" Let me explain what Parson's PAC is saying in a new wave of attacks filled with shocking and obvious lies.
# Nicole Galloway for Missouri
Earlier today, Parson's PAC launched a new wave of attacks filled with shocking and obvious lies, like accusing me and supporters like you of being ""pro-crime.""
I won't dignify these offensive and false attacks with a response. But I will tell you what it says about this race: The status quo is running scared.
In a moment, I'll ask you for your help to fight back — but first, let me explain.
On Governor Parson's watch, everyday families have struggled with rising healthcare costs, underfunded schools and fewer opportunities — all while insiders and mega-donors have been raking in favors and kickbacks. When I'm governor, that all comes to an end — and the folks in power know it.
When we launched this campaign, early polls had us down against Parson by double digits. Now more than a year, multiple fundraising records, and millions of calls and texts later, our grassroots movement has made Missouri a battleground state. The billionaires and special interests are spinning up outrageous lies every week because they're panicking — as they should be.
As Auditor, I've been the taxpayers’ independent watchdog. I've uncovered more than $370 million in wasted or stolen taxpayer money and brought more than 60 criminal counts against corrupt public officials from both political parties. When I say I'll end their culture of corruption, they know it's no BS — that's why I'm running to defeat Mike Parson, and it's why I'm asking for your support today:
Will you add a donation of $5 or whatever you can to my campaign so we can set the record straight for undecided voters before Election Day? We can’t settle for a bought-and-paid-for system any longer — not during this pandemic and not for what comes next — so your donation right now is critical.
Thanks for making a difference when it matters most,
Nicole

Alex, Trump continues to abuse his power to an extent never before seen in American history:
* He refused to divest from his business interests.
* He pardoned his friends and campaign staffers for crimes they committed in his name.
* He was impeached for abusing the power of the presidency.
* And all that was before he pressured voters to commit crimes by casting their ballot twice in the upcoming election.
These are not minor issues, they’re serious offenses that demand immediate consequences. Over a third of Americans still stand by Trump and his overreach of executive power – but with only weeks until people begin casting their ballots, we need to know you’re not one of them.

Alex,
Today we have big news out of San Francisco: District Attorney Chesa Boudin has ended the use of cash bail in all criminal cases!
Previously, when people were arrested in a criminal case they were held in jail until their trial unless they could they could provide “cash bail”—a large amount of money—to the court. The money is later returned if the defendant appears at all their court dates, though this can be weeks or even months later.
This system unfairly targeted low income people whose families are less likely to have cash on-hand. This means that low income defendants who have not been convicted of a crime were held in jail longer than their wealthy peers and lose their job or worse.
Today’s news is an example of how quickly we can make change when we elect progressive candidates. Can you chip in $15 to help us get to Congress today?

The more progressives we elect to office the more we can accomplish.
Bernie Sanders spoke out in support of Chesa Boudin’s decision today and of ending cash bail nationwide. In order to accomplish this, it’s critical that we not only elect Bernie as President but that we elect a progressive congress ready to support his agenda.

MY CANDIDATE STATEMENT
Ronald Reagan proclaimed our country as a Beacon of Light and a Shining City on a Hill, but right now we are not reaching our potential as a country.
We need leaders with solutions. We need leaders that can relate to the struggles of everyday people. Most importantly, we need leaders that value honesty and new ideas.
I understand your struggles and I am bringing new ideas, the needed experience and a fresh perspective to the table that will help restore the American dream.
As a business owner and concerned citizen, I worry for the future of Californian families. We have high taxes, increased crime, inadequate enforcement of immigration laws and growing poverty rates.
In Orange County, rents are skyrocketing, homelessness is on the rise, and regardless of party, leaders are not acting in good faith to the great people they represent.
The last thing we need right now are more career politicians. It is time for change and I will never stop fighting on behalf of you!
I am running on a Pro-Constitution, American Family Values and Common-Sense Conservative platform. Once I am your Congressman, we will Make Orange County Great Again!
My campaign is For Our Country and For Our Future. I graciously ask for your vote in this upcoming election. I encourage you to go to my website, [[URL REDACTED]], to read my story and my platform.

10,"The candidates will make their pitches for how they can defeat Trump, but we can't stop there.
Friend –
Seven Democratic candidates are gearing up to take the stage tonight in New Hampshire. With just four days before the first-in-the-nation primary, the stakes have never been higher. But that's not the only reason why:
Trump's acquittal this week, orchestrated by Mitch McConnell in a trial with no witnesses or evidence, means that the only way to hold Republicans accountable is at the ballot box.
Since Senate Republicans refused to take Trump's crimes seriously, it's up to us to defeat his agenda and his allies in the states. That starts with a strong leader at the top of the ticket – and the seven amazing candidates on stage tonight.
If winning in November is the only way to make Republicans pay for their actions, we need to start gearing up now to take victory at every single level.
The stakes have never been higher. Before the debate starts, chip in $10 to help defeat Trump's allies and elect more state Democrats >>

By acquitting Trump for crimes he openly admitted committing, Republicans tried to absolve themselves of any and all responsibility to the Constitution. That's what makes the 2020 elections so crucial.
This fight is far from over. It will continue in tonight's Democratic debate, then tomorrow when we keep organizing and mobilizing like never before. We need everyone to take part.
Tonight, the attention will shift from Trump's crimes and the Republicans' coverup, to the Democrats leading the charge against them. We MUST use this moment to seize the advantage. Pitch in $10 tonight to elect state Democrats and hold corrupt Republicans accountable >>

11,"Alex,
Last week the MNGOP, the House Republican Caucus and the Senate Republican Caucus unleashed it’s animosity toward MAGASOTA, its members and insulted grassroots activists across the state.
From the moment MAGASOTA launched we have been under attack. Sadly those attacks have been lies, mischaracterizations and smear campaigns. They have been constant and ongoing by RINOs and other activists who supposedly support our president.
Thursday the MNGOP led by chair Jennifer Carnahan, the Senate Republican Caucus led by Senator Paul Gazelka and House Minority leader Kurt Daudt , with your tax dollars, created a website that features MAGASOTA, a pro life group and a pro gun group as scammers.
This is a serious allegation that has no merit. They are accusing us of something criminal. No crime has been committed. No one has been scammed. It is truly pathetic to know that our elected officials who are paid by our tax dollars would spend your tax money and waste valuable time going after Trump supporters.
The swamp is alive and well right here in St Paul. Why aren’t they putting effort into denouncing America hating Ilhan Omar? Why aren’t they lowering our taxes? Why are they funding the fraudulent DHS? Why do they continue to infringe on our rights? Why are they voting on unconstitutional omnibus bills and funding abortion? Why are they giving themselves a raise?
Who are the real scammers?
They would rather spend time and money going after taxpayers, voters, grassroots activists, Trump supporters and people who love freedom and liberty- Americans.
This is the most outrageous attack on MAGASOTA and members. This is a Minnesota version of what President Trump has gone through in DC. Tragically the MNGOP is attacking it’s very own supporters. The Trump haters in this state are coming out of the closet. Are they afraid of losing their power? Are they afraid of WE THE PEOPLE?
MAGASOTA’s mission has been clear from the beginning and hasn’t changed. We are here to win Minnesota for President Trump.
This attack is sickening and without merit, tarnishing the reputation of the good people working for President Trump. It’s a play straight out of Saul Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals.
MAGASOTA will not be stopped. We know our supporters and members see right through the slander and libel, and will continue to work for President Trump. Read what they published on their website about MAGASOTA.
“ these scammers aren’t affiliated with the official campaign in any way, shape or form.”
“The MAGAsota folks are diverting valuable volunteer time to an effort that will have a marginal effect on the actual election. Remember, Minnesota has not voted for a Republican Presidential candidate since 1972 so it will take everyone “rowing the boat” in the same direction”
“There has never been a more robust effort in the state of Minnesota. Efforts like MAGAsota look good on the surface but without coordination with the real campaigns, ultimately result in a waste of valuable volunteer time.”
So because we are not affiliated with the “official campaign” our efforts will be marginal? Diverting valuable volunteer time? No -we are actually doing the work.
Do you really think President Trump would support this kind of BS? No. He would not. He would welcome any support and effort put forth on his behalf.
President Trump has been the outsider and remains the outsider. He is working to drain the swamp-not be a part of it.
Then on Friday the MNGOP sent an email to everyone in the state standing behind their false allegations of scamming. Let me tell you what they said.
“Despite those great strides, the foundation of who we are as Minnesota Republicans is being assaulted and manipulated by outside groups posing as Trump supporters and leaders.”
Those are pretty strong baseless allegations. MAGASOTA has not assaulted anyone nor has anyone been manipulated. MAGASOTA members are free to come and go as they please. Our members are “free thinkers”. Why is the mngop assaulting the intelligence of our members?
“These groups prey on low information activists that love our President- and manipulate those activists to get involved in efforts that cause harm to our President’s ability to win Minnesota”.
The GOP Party leadership believes that YOU are low information activists because you don’t tow the line for them.
Hillary Clinton called us Deplorables. Now our own Republican party is calling us “low information”. I think not.
No one is causing harm to the President. It’s the party that is causing harm to the President. They are dividing supporters -not MAGASOTA. Our state hasn’t won a Republican Presidential race since 1972.
This is on the party-not me and not you! Own up to your own failures MNGOP.
“These groups also actively work against Republicans in our state- which hurt our chances to hold the majority in the State Senate and win back the State House.”
More lies. We are endorsing one candidate and supporting one race. President Trump. If Trump doesn’t win we all lose!
“We have one goal in this state- to elect Republicans up and down the ballot. Any outside group or entity that tries to use our activists and leaders to work against our President and fellow Republicans will not be accepted by our party. We are standing strong with our Repuclicna partners at the RNC, Trump Victory, NRcc, NRSC, Minnesota House and MInnesota State Senate.”
Who is the party to lay claim on activists and volunteers? They do not own you. The arrogance of this statement is nauseating.
And finally the party is making it very clear that MAGASOTA or any other grassroots effort is REJECTED BY THEM!
“Turn out to caucus and don’t let the scammers take over our party and run us into the ground.”
Really? That is what they think about us? That we will participate in the political process, take over “our” party and run “us” into the ground. This is just unbelievable. This party does NOT want Trump supporters participating.
Finally my friend, MAGASOTA is a PAC. We by law cannot work in direct coordination with a campaign. We will be using our financial resources to support our effort to win Minnesota for President Trump. Our members have already been going door to door, making thousands of phone calls, participating in MAGASOTA meetups, sending thousands of email and more. Our efforts remain in Minnesota. Our calls stay in Minnesota.
President Trump has claimed Minnesota. WE are not going to disappoint him.
2020 is likely our last chance to elect a Republican President in this state. I do not believe in my life time there will be another opportunity. Communism has taken hold in [[URL REDACTED]]
Your support of MAGASOTA is needed now more than ever! Please show the MN GOP that we are the opposite of ‘low information activists’ by working with us!

Hi , it’s Tom Cotton, Senator for Arkansas. I’m reaching out today about Dr. Roger Marshall, our Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Kansas.
Dr. Marshall is a pro-life physician who’s delivered more than 5,000 babies. He’s a fellow veteran who’s tough on crime and will work to END our dependence on China.
Chuck Schumer and the radical left have made Dr. Marshall one of their TOP targets this year. In fact, liberal donors have flooded Kansas with $10 MILLION to prop up Dr. Marshall’s opponent — a pro-abortion, pro-amnesty, and pro-Green New Deal radical Democrat.
I need Dr. Marshall in the Senate to fight with me against Communist China and the liberal mob — and to PROTECT THE SUPREME COURT. And I’m personally asking YOU to help him WIN. Will you rush a donation to help Dr. Marshall’s team reach their End of Quarter goal RIGHT NOW?
RUSH DONATE $250
RUSH DONATE $100
RUSH DONATE $50

Democrats need FOUR seats to flip the Senate — and they’ve made Dr. Marshall and Kansas a TOP TARGET.
And if they win in Kansas, they’ll be one step closer to forcing their socialist agenda of PACKING the Supreme Court, defunding the police, mass amnesty, and the Green New Deal on the American people.
Dr. Marshall is fighting to take Kansas off Chuck Schumer’s map, but he needs our help. I’m personally asking YOU to join me in standing with Dr. Marshall for U.S. Senate.
Please, rush a donation of $15, $50, or even $100 RIGHT NOW.
We’re counting on your swift response.

13,"Our July 4th celebrations are taking on a very different meaning this year.
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
Our July 4th celebrations are taking on a very different meaning this year.
We're usually excited to share with you information about ways to celebrate with Democrats in your area, whether it's picnics, parades, fireworks, or other festivities.
But the COVID-19 pandemic has cancelled those gatherings, and we want to strongly urge you and your loved ones to keep your July 4th celebrations local, and small.
Governor Kate Brown's face covering requirement for public indoor spaces is now in place across all of Oregon, and it's critical that all of us look out for each other and do our part to help stop the spread of the virus.
July 4th also takes on a deeper meaning in light of the widespread protests for racial justice and against police brutality.
The last few weeks have seen hopeful signs of progress here in Oregon.
In last week's special session, the Oregon Legislature declared affirmatively that Black Lives Matter, and passed laws to reform police accountability. I want to thank the Oregon Legislature's BIPOC Caucus for their inspiring leadership in passing those measures, and look forward to working alongside them as we move to create a more just society here in Oregon.
But this is just the beginning of that work, and as many of us take time today to celebrate the founding of our nation, we must also take time to reckon with America's original sin — slavery — and the fact that we are still dealing with its consequences more than 150 years since its abolition.
Frederick Douglass in 1856, around 38 years of age
Frederick Douglass in 1856
Personally, it's an opportunity to revisit one of the most cutting assessments of our Independence Day, delivered by Frederick Douglass in 1852:
""Fellow-citizens, pardon me, allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here to-day? What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? ... I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought light and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn. ... Fellow-citizens, above your national, tumultuous joy, I hear the mournful wail of millions! whose chains, heavy and grievous yesterday, are, to-day, rendered more intolerable by the jubilee shouts that reach them.
[[URL REDACTED]], to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer; a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are, to Him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy-a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of the United States, at this very hour.""
Douglass, rightly so, doesn't mince any words. But he closes his speech looking forward, with a glimmer of hope:
""Allow me to say, in conclusion, notwithstanding the dark picture I have this day presented, of the state of the nation, I do not despair of this country. There are forces in operation which must inevitably work the downfall of slavery. ... I, therefore, leave off where I began, with hope. While drawing encouragement from ""the Declaration of Independence,"" the great principles it contains, and the genius of American Institutions, my spirit is also cheered by the obvious tendencies of the age. Nations do not now stand in the same relation to each other that they did ages ago. No nation can now shut itself up from the surrounding world and trot round in the same old path of its fathers without interference. The time was when such could be done. Long established customs of hurtful character could formerly fence themselves in, and do their evil work with social impunity. Knowledge was then confined and enjoyed by the privileged few, and the multitude walked on in mental darkness. But a change has now come over the affairs of mankind.""
You can read the full text of Douglass' address here.
From all of us at the Democratic Party of Oregon, please stay safe, stay local, and stay healthy this weekend.
Thank you,

14,"Alex,
My opponent just became the first candidate in our race to go negative.
In a TV ad that launched yesterday, appointed Representative Perrin Jones accuses me of talking about ""weakening our police departments."" His proof? That I support common-sense investments in police accountability through body cameras, de-escalation training, and a statewide independent oversight committee made up of members from both the law enforcement and civilian community. All of these proposals would actually improve trust between our police and communities, as well as give additional funding to our law enforcement agencies.
This was the first TV ad of my opponent's entire campaign. Instead of presenting a positive vision that stands on its own merits, he has chosen to try and scare voters by attacking me. My criminal justice platform actually calls for more resources, and in addition to those calls for accountability, I rolled out a number of policy goals in July to help broadly reform North Carolina’s criminal justice system. You can read those here.
We need to get the message out that this was a blatant scare tactic aimed at misleading the voters of Pitt County. Can you help us combat my opponents' false TV ad by donating today?
I'm no stranger to the importance of law enforcement. In fact, I worked for three years for the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of North Carolina where I helped support federal prosecutors combatting drug violence, gang activity, white collar crime, and other serious offenses. Here in Greenville, I'm a regular attendee of National Night Out, a community-building campaign that promotes police-community partnerships. Plus, I work with a number of law enforcement agencies through my current job in the private sector.
I'm trying to offer real solutions to some of the most serious issues facing all our people. Part of reforming North Carolina's criminal justice system means making sure local departments can maintain the trust of our communities through the highest level of integrity and accountability. Instead of running false ads, perhaps Perrin Jones should explain to voters why he is against that idea.
As always, thank you for your support.
Sincerely,
Brian Farkas
2020 Candidate for NC House District 9

And it's happening tomorrow.
After months of hearings, shocking revelations, and shameful GOP obstruction, we've arrived at the most critical moment in the Trump-Ukraine affair. Before the House votes, we must show Republicans that we're united against Trump's misconduct and GOP state legislators' efforts to cover for him.

Fellow Conservative,
I’m sure you’re disgusted to witness the devastation of Democrat-run cities as crime and violence spike to record levels under the mob rule of Antifa and violent rioters.
And as Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and their far-Left party cheer-on mass rioting and looting across the country, I know you agree that the soul of America is at stake in 2020.
That’s why we’re emailing you to make an urgent request:
Will you donate $25, $50 or more so that we can continue stand with President Trump and fight the far-Left socialists in this pivotal election?
So, your generous donation today will also give a critical push in this crucial final month before the election.
In case you missed my speech at the Republican National Convention, I said,
> “…the Republican Party is the pro-America party, and President Donald J. Trump is the pro-America candidate.”
We’ve been defending President Trump from the never-ending onslaught of attacks, including:
* An insane, fake-news fueled Russia-collusion hoax,
* Robert Mueller’s taxpayer-funded “investigation”, and
* Adam Schiff and the Dem’s despicable impeachment sham!
We CANNOT allow these far-left radicals to win in November!
Will you join our fight to defend conservative values and the United States Constitution by making your best gift of $25, $50 or more?
If Republicans lose in November, conservatives like you and me won’t be able to stop the far-left from radically transforming America into a socialist nation with their radical plans to:
* Defund the police
* Defund Border Patrol
* Defund our Military!
Unlike Joe Biden and his far-Left pals, we are proud of America’s founding conservative principles that created the greatest, most prosperous nation in human history.
So, please join the fight for our cherished conservative values by supporting my re-election with the most generous contribution you can afford.
Thanks in advance for your support.
And may God bless you, and the United States of America!
In liberty,
Jim Jordan

If you weren't paying attention to the GOP Convention speaker list, here's one you need to know: Matt Gaetz.
Tonight, on a national stage, Gaetz will sing Trump's praises -- in spite of every crisis Trump created for us, every occasion he utterly failed to rise to, and every burden he put on the backs of the American people.
There's no telling what Gaetz will say exactly, but we'd wager it'll be divisive, tone-deaf, ignorant, self-promotional, and so boastful you'll want to throw your television straight into the garbage.
What Gaetz should be doing, instead of soaking up the limelight, is working with partners in the Senate to deliver relief for communities suffering from the coronavirus. He should be holding Trump accountable for his crimes. He should be apologizing for failing to serve our district with the honor and integrity we deserve.
Let's make this the first and last time we see Gaetz speaking as a congressman at the GOP Convention. Chip in $5 or more now to return honor and integrity to Florida's 1st by electing Phil Ehr to Congress.

Friend, Trump continues to abuse his power to an extent never before seen in American history:
* He refused to divest from his business interests.
* He pardoned his friends and campaign staffers for crimes they committed in his name.
* He was impeached for abusing the power of the presidency.
* He demanded that AG Bill Barr jail all of his political enemies.
* And that was before POLITICO reported that Trump “tramples government boundaries as election nears” with his use of federal resources to prop up his campaign.
These are not minor issues, they’re serious offenses that demand immediate consequences. Over a third of Americans still stand by Trump and his overreach of executive power – but with people casting their ballots right now, we need to know you’re not one of them.

Dear Conservative,
I’m Aliscia Andrews. I’m the US Marine and National Security expert running against Socialist Jennifer Wexton in Virginia’s 10th District!
Right now, we need YOUR help to stop the Socialist Left and Mike Bloomberg for buying this district for Jennifer Wexton. Again. Will you help with a donation today?
As we face a wave of crime, violence, and anarchy targeting cops, Democrats decided to INTENTIONALLY make them easier targets.
The Virginia State Senate, controlled by cop-hating Democrats, passed a bill that would make assaulting an officer a misdemeanor and drops the mandatory minimum of six months for assaulting an officer.
This is the Leftist America Democrats are trying to force down our throats!
They are handing this country to criminals—while intentionally trying to get our cops hurt.
We MUST stop this! That’s why I need your help!
Socialist Wexton is part of the Defund the Police effort nationally that would hurt our cops even more!
I need your help to meet my fundraising end of the month goal of $50,000 dollars! We need this money to compete against Wexton’s absentee ballot push!
We are running out of time!
Will you help us reach our goal with a donation of $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, $1,000, or more today?
*HELP US REACH OUR GOAL!*
I have and always will stand with our officers. I know what it feels like to serve in a uniform.
Socialist Wexton is part of the problem. She is standing with the same Leftists actively encouraging violence against our police!
This law the state Senate passed will only serve to encourage violence against our police!
We have to STOP this lawlessness and take our country back! To do that, we must protect the men and women who protect us!
Please send your best donation and help us beat Socialism and lawlessness in Virginia!
Thank you for your support and prayers!

22,"One of these bills that I am particularly proud of is HB20-1409, a bill that Representative Adrienne Benavidez and I have been working on since last year to better serve our immigrant communities.
Photo courtesy of Hyoung Chang, The Denver Post
Hi Alex,
A lot of important bills that we had been working on all year had to pass in a shorter timeframe than usual. One of these bills that I am particularly proud of is HB20-1409, a bill that Representative Adrienne Benavidez and I have been working on since last year to better serve our immigrant communities.
HB20-1409 brings privately-run, for-profit detention centers that house non-citizens in Colorado in line with state penal institution standards. These detention centers - like the ICE detention facility in Aurora run by the Florida company GEO Group - were not held to the same health and safety standards of other state-run institutions. This has been a problem for years with detained individuals reporting a lack of medical care, moldy and contaminated food, concerns about cleanliness and health, and lack of access to legal representation and contact with their families.
These facilities house people detained at the border, those waiting for decisions on claims for asylum, and noncitizens living in the U.S. who were arrested for crimes or administrative infractions. Many of the detainees have not been convicted - or even accused - of a crime, but rather of violating a civil administrative violation. It's clear that our immigration system is profoundly broken.
We have a lot more to do, but I am hopeful that HB20-1409 will put pressure on detention facilities like GEO to comply with basic health and safety standards. This could not be more critical.
All the best,
Why Is It Important?
In 2019, an ACLU investigation uncovered various cases of disturbing and unethical treatment of detained immigrants at Aurora's GEO facility, including; a heart attack death due to “incompetence,” a man whose leg was amputated after complaints of bedsores were ignored, a man whose injuries went untreated after he was attacked by other detainees, a man who was told by a psychiatrist that “no one cared about him and that he should sign voluntary deportation papers,” a “botched tooth extraction,” and a man who was denied access to hearing aids. They found that the center lacked critical medical staff and that one detainee died after not receiving mandatory health screenings and medication. There have also been reports of retaliation against detainees who have raised concerns, such as staff withholding food and recreation time. All of this occurred before COVID-19.
Photo courtesy of Cullen Lobe, The Colorado Independent
The current pandemic has only further exacerbated the need for state inspections of all facilities to ensure proper cleaning protocols, adequate medical care and accessible testing. In April, a federal judge found that ICE did not do enough to respond to coronavirus and “likely exhibited callous indifference to the safety and well-being” of people in its custody. This on top of the fact that detainees are having to wait much longer for a hearing and are often kept in isolation for days at a time. As of last week, the GEO facility in Aurora has confirmed 16 cases of COVID-19 and is still considered to have an “active” outbreak.
Testimonials
* Even before the pandemic, Abel worried about access to medical care and the often unsanitary conditions of the medical holding cell. At the beginning of the crisis, GEO was understaffed and his unit didn’t get access to clean towels for days at a time. He also didn’t get enough soap or disinfectants. When the facility finally started changing systems because of COVID, he was forced in his cell 23 hours a day, with so many people it was impossible to remain 6 feet apart. “My fear of COVID19 and the anxiety that comes with it are very real. I had a nightmare that I was sick, sweating, and unable to breathe or get the help I needed. I don’t want to die here at GEO in detention.”
\- Abel, detained at GEO for over a year
* Miguel Angel suffered a broken hand at the hands of a GEO guard in March 2019 that never received treatment, and he endured numerous quarantines after several outbreaks of mumps, measles, and chickenpox. Frustrated with the unlivable conditions, Miguel Angel became an outspoken advocate from inside of the GEO immigrant detention center for over a year, organizing a hunger strike and prompting a congressional probe into the detention conditions at the GEO facility, as well as a federal lawsuit against ICE and GEO Group. Miguel Angel made the difficult decision that his health could no longer bear the cruel and unfair treatment of GEO detention, and accepted voluntary departure to Mexico, even though he hasn’t been there since he was 13 years old.
\- Miguel Angel, detained for over two years, self deported
* ""I worry about my husband getting sick with COVID-19 in detention. As a health care worker, I know they are not doing everything they need to to keep everyone in there safe. He has to share a cell with 5 other people for most of the day, so it's impossible for them to follow social distancing. The past month, he was in his cell for 23 hours a day. There were some days that he was left in his cell for days at a time.
\- Claudia Robles, wife of detained immigrant and Medical Assistant
HB20-1409: What Does It Do?
With the passage of HB20-1409, Colorado will bring facilities housing non-citizens on civil immigration cases under the same standards as other facilities in the state. The bill requires the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to inspect these facilities and report their findings to the legislature. It also allows the state to perform unannounced inspections and for family members to lodge complaints about conditions within the facility. This bill passed with bipartisan support in both chambers.

Business Insider explains it best: (we’ve included the most important parts)
Business Insider: Trump reportedly rejected approving a bailout package that would rescue the US Postal Service, and it could be a disaster for states trying to expand voting by mail
The United States has plunged the US Postal Service into dire financial straits, as more Americans than ever rely on post offices to deliver necessary medicine and supplies, especially in underserved rural areas.
House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Gerry Conolly, who runs the subcommittee that oversees the Postal Service, sounded the alarm that the agency could run out of funding altogether by June if Congress doesn't act soon.
""Based on a number of briefings and warnings this week about a critical fall-off in mail across the country, it has become clear that the Postal Service will not survive the summer without immediate help from Congress and the White House,"" the two said in a March 23 joint statement, calling on Congress to appropriate $25 million in emergency funds to the agency.

As states have steadily expanded absentee and mail-in voting over the past two decades, the proportion of Americans voting in-person on election day has declined from 90% in 1992 to 60% in 2016, according to the US Census Bureau.
But some Republicans have openly protested expanding vote by mail options because they believe it would hurt them politically. Trump said in a recent ""Fox & Friends"" appearance that the House's stimulus provisions had ""levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.""
Since then, Trump has continued to spread misinformation about the safety and security of voting by mail on his Twitter account, falsely claiming that it ""substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD,"" which none of the available evidence on vote by mail supports.

Alex,
NPR: “Top congressional Democrats are calling for a federal investigation after a nurse who worked at an immigration detention center in Georgia filed a whistleblower complaint alleging a lack of medical care and unsafe work practices that facilitated the spread of COVID-19. She also says that immigrant women received questionable hysterectomies.”
ICE has a history of committing human rights abuses while emboldened under the Trump administration \-- first separating families at the border, then leaving migrant children in cages, and now, allegations have surfaced that a doctor in an ICE detention center performed mass hysterectomies on unknowing migrant women without their consent.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is demanding an investigative briefing on these alleged crimes by the end of the week \-- stating: “this profoundly disturbing situation recalls some of the darkest moments of our nation’s history.” But ICE officials are denying any fault.
Since Trump’s election, we’ve seen a rise in xenophobia and hate crimes targeting immigrants and communities of color. Despite mounting evidence of abuse taking place in detention centers across the country, Trump has praised ICE as “compassionate” and said if centers are too crowded, “tell them not to come to the USA.” Another four years of Trump’s inhumane leadership will completely erase the values this country was founded on, but nearly 50% of Americans approve of Trump’s immigration policy. Today we need to know, do you?
Do you condemn ICE's human rights abuses?
YES NO

29,"Legislation to protect children who survive botched abortions failed in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, including ""no"" votes from Sens. Peters and Stabenow.
PETERS, STABENOW FILIBUSTER BORN ALIVE BABIES
On Tuesday, February 25, the U.S. Senate failed to advance two prolife pieces of legislation. Though both bills received majority support, the pro-abortion minority in the U.S. Senate had enough votes to filibuster the bills.
The first bill, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, based on evidence that children at that point in pregnancy can feel pain from the gruesome abortion methods designed to take their lives. The vote was 53 to 44, failing to get the three-fifths vote required to ""end debate.""
The second bill, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, would add specific protections in law for children who survive botched abortions. The vote was 56 to 41, just short of the three-fifths needed.
Both of our U.S. Senators from Michigan, Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow, voted to filibuster these bills. While filibustering has grown in popularity in recent years, it's still generally used for only controversial bills.
What's so controversial about providing medical care to newborns? The original Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 received unanimous consent in the U.S. Senate; they didn't even have to hold a vote. Today, many elected officials are so in thrall to Planned Parenthood that they fail to condemn what amounts to an after-birth abortion, leaving children who survive botched abortions to die because they weren't ""wanted.""
Even despite recent evidence and growing support from some for infanticide and medical neglect of newborns who survive botched abortions, Sens. Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow were unmoved. They believe protecting newborns is so controversial that legislation mandating equal treatment for them must not even be allowed to be voted on.

MARCH 10 PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY
Just a quick reminder that time is running out if you want to request an absentee ballot for the March 10 presidential primary in Michigan. Remember, Michigan election law changes mean you can request an absentee ballot for any reason, or even go to your local clerk's office and cast an ""early vote"" by filling out a ballot there.
RIGHT TO LIFE RESOURCES: INFANTICIDE
Though thankfully most people still agree infanticide is wrong, infanticide has always been with us and will always be with us in some form. Because of that, opposing infanticide is part of Right to Life of Michigan's mission statement.
Historically and today, the greatest concern with infanticide is withholding medical care from disabled babies. We have a page on our website devoted to this major issue we address. If you haven't heard of Baby Doe, or Kermit Gosnell, or Michigan's Safe Delivery Law, you should give it a look.
Infanticide page
FILIBUSTERING ABORTION
While Senators Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow voted to hold the debate open on those two prolife bills indefinitely, that's just a tactic to take advantage of U.S. Senate rules. In truth, they don't want abortion to be discussed or debated. Pro-abortion elected officials want to keep abortion in the dark, completely unrestricted, far from the eyes of health department officials. When stories like the Kermit Gosnell case come to light, instead of being outraged by thousands of infanticides allowed to occur under the noses of state health inspectors, they insist it's just a ""local crime story"" to be swept under the rug.
Our job is to constantly keep abortion in the public spotlight, because we know that such a great injustice only works if we can pretend the unborn child doesn't exist. We're going to keep ""filibustering"" abortion no matter what the laws say, the media reports, or judges approve, for as long as it takes.

30,"Hi Alex,
First, I want to remind you that Our 15th Year Anniversary Virtual Celebration is still ongoing, and the need for your financial support is stronger than ever. Please help us start the next fifteen years with a firm foundation by making your donation today.
### Donate Here for our 15th Anniversary!
> > We hope you enjoyed Independence Day safely and with family and friends. While there is still a lot of Summer left, there is much work to do to prepare us for the upcoming battle in the Fall. And there are issues that must be fought for outside of the election. In this week's Newsletter we'll cover some of them.
### Sign Up for Our Volunteer Army!
Our top priority this Summer – and until November – is to reach out to our neighbors in often neglected areas of NW Philly and have good conversations with them about the importance of winning back the White House – to put an end to this corrupt administration – and do it so soundly that it sends a message to his enablers that the crime spree is over.
What will it take? It will require us to redouble our efforts from past campaigns. We must work together as a well-coordinated Volunteer Army to make calls (and knock doors where we can) to talk with the folks who stayed home in 2016, and to follow up with them to make sure they apply for a mail-in ballot (or commit to vote safely on Election Day).
The work we do this year will not be easy, but it is critical if we want to remain a democracy. If we commit to work together, if we call upon our friends to join us in this endeavor, we will deliver Pennsylvania on November 3rd. We will also have laid the foundation for the work that needs to be done in the coming year in those neighborhoods that have been long ignored.
Our work starts in August. Are you ready to step up?

### Voter Registration Opportunities
We are gearing up to phone bank and canvass (where appropriate) in NW Philly starting in a few weeks. Meanwhile, we still need to get folks registered to vote. If you'd like to help with this effort, you can do it here:
Ongoing –Tabling to Register Voters: If you are willing to spend some time tabling in high-traffic areas to register new voters, please email [[URL REDACTED]]
July 17th – Youth Voter Registration Party, 4-6PM: There will be music and snacks as we ask our younger neighbors to get involved in the governing of our nation by registering to vote, and then applying to vote by mail. We'll also be shooting some Tik Tok videos to share. The street party takes place near Temple University at 1428 Cecil B. Moore Ave.
### Open Forum on Philly Climate Issues: July 29th at 7PM
You are invited to join the Neighborhood Networks Environmental Committee and NW Philly Climate Action Network (NW Philly CAN) on Wednesday, July 29, 7 pm, for an on-line gathering highlighting the latest news about key climate-related issues and projects in Philadelphia. Speakers will include Meenal Raval on PECO and PGW’s recent hearings on rate hikes, Lynn Robinson on the SEPTA Nicetown Gas Plant, a combined heat/power plant, and Philly Thrive on Hilco’s conversion of the PES site.
For the zoom link, please RSVP to [[URL REDACTED]]
Thanks for all you do!

Those filthy rotten liberals.
I don’t know about you, but they make me so angry I could spit fire.
Nothing but a bunch of lying, conniving, sneaky socialist pigs.
Look, I’ve always been brutally honest with you and now I must share something with you I’ve been dreading...
It kills me to do so.
It’s bad but I must let you know, or I’d never forgive myself so here goes:
I’m scared to death we’re starting to lose the battle...
It feels as if Trump’s reelection is slipping through our fingers.
We CAN’T let that happen.
You do want 4 more years of Trump, right?
If so, please sign our Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP.
President Trump needs to know how many Patriots he can count on.
In fact...
We’re finalizing the list of Patriots who already completed the Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP on Election Day—and we need to know you’re with us.
Make absolutely sure you’re on the list and not left out.
Can you imagine what our country will turn into Trump is not elected and the radical left takes over?
If you thought Obama was bad you ain’t seen nothing yet.
We’ve got to fight harder, scream louder, round up every Trump supporter we know...
Every undecided sitting on the fence...
And RISE UP.
I’m worried sick. I can’t sleep at night and I can’t eat.
My stomach is in knots—and I know I’m not alone.
Even Ted Cruz is running scared right now.
He came right out and said it...
“I'm worried about the election. I think it's really volatile. I think it could go either way. [[URL REDACTED]] president could win by a big margin and we could win both houses of Congress, [[URL REDACTED]] could be devastating.”
Let’s face it. Trump had a setback with Covid-19.
No question it’s putting him behind with his campaigning.
What’s worse...
Do you know what the Democrats are up to now while no one is looking?
Secretly funneling $170 million in government grants to radical left-wing extremist groups to carry out their dirty work
The group funding them—the Tides Center—has been flying under the radar for years...
Constantly creating new activist groups—that’s their sole mission.
These radical activist groups are the ones burning our country down.
If this doesn’t make you steamed, I don’t know what will because...
They’re using YOUR tax dollars!!!!
And they’re using them to fund radical extremist groups like Marxist Black Lives Matter Global Network...
Not to mention the Tides Center is an incubator for gun control and abortion rights.
They’re like this giant secretive dark money pit that Democrat donors throw massive amounts of money into.
Just to give you a little taste...
Millions have come from the insidious likes of George Soros's Open Society Foundations.
Need I say more? This is as bad as I’ve ever seen it.
Not only are they using extremist groups now but...
IF Trump loses these radicals are going to overrun the country...
They’re going to be crawling all over the White House, Oval Office and seats of Congress like cockroaches.
America will be lost forever.
Is that what you want?
I sure as hell don’t.
Look my friend, the liberals and their “super snowflakes” have mega money to burn and...
They’re throwing it at the feet of any radical that will take up their cause: defeat Trump and turn America into a globalist cabal.
Senator Cruz said it best...
""There are a lot of Democrats trying to steal the election...” “The left is showing up. They're pissed off. They hate Trump. We've got to make sure everyone else shows up.”
We need you to show up NOW — not tomorrow or the next day or only on November 3 at the voting booth.
Time is running out fast.
Now I know sometimes people wonder, well what can I do besides vote?
A LOT! This election is riding on YOU, a true Patriot.
If you want 4 more years of Trump here’s what you can do:
I need you to sign the Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP right now.
We’ve got to rally everyone to make this happen—to keep Trump in the Oval Office for another 4 years.
Imagine the horrors if he doesn’t get reelected...
Liberals will undermine the Constitution and  PACK  the Supreme Court...
They’re going to come running for your guns and ammo...
Then they’ll obliterate the Second Amendment...
Free speech will be shackled and chained...
Religious freedom will be abolished.
Remember how they removed God from our monuments, schools and military already under Obama?That was phase 1.
No doubt phase 2 will be the complete eradication of God.
Bibles will be [[URL REDACTED]] of worship will be taxed, putting them out of business...probably boarded up.
That cross around your neck? It’ll become a crime to wear it.
I’m not kidding. This is the liberal horror show—their vision if the Democrats get elected.
There is SO much at stake we can’t sit by and let the liberal loons take control of our beloved country.
It’s up to us.
Please do these 2 things right now:
1\. The Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP—sign here.
2\. Make a donation to keep us fighting and help put Trump firmly back in the lead so we have a runaway election. Click here.
Look, I’m asking you to do this because I’m worried. I didn’t see your name on the Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP.
I checked it again and again. See for yourself:
Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP
Supporter: Friend
ACCOUNT NUMBER: 12181995 - 2020
Supporter Pledge: NOT FOUND
DEADLINE: MIDNIGHT
PLEDGE YOUR VOTE NOW
Status: The Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP List will be sent to all Republican Congress tomorrow morning - don't be left behind.
Now you may be thinking, “Yeah I saw the polls but the polls can’t be trusted.”
Yes, we know the media and pollsters lie but...
You and I can’t take it for granted that Trump is ahead either.
He’s lost ground the past week being quarantined and not on the campaign trail.
We must keep fighting this brutal battle until Trump is officially declared a winner.
There are less than 25 days until election day.
Ask yourself one question:
Are you a TRUE Patriot? If your answer is YES...
Sign the Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP right now.
Then give a donation to help us get out there on the frontlines fighting this battle to the end.
$35, $50, $75, $150 or whatever you can give is great.
It’s a lot to ask in times like these, I know.
But I also know we will all be in financial ruins if Biden wins.
Jobs will be lost...
The market will crash...
Economic recovery will never happen in our lifetime.
Every donation you give of any amount counts towards helping Trump, the underdog, WIN this election.
Your donation puts our army of Trump supporters on the phone...
...relentlessly blasting our messages across social media...
... churning out faxes and emails...
...putting boots on the ground in DC and across the country...
... organizing rallies, marches and boat parades...
Please think of what America will look like under Biden and his corrupt DemoCRAP cronies.
It’s terrifying.
How badly do you want 4 more years or Trump leading America?
Will your name be on the list of Trump’s TOP supporters going to Republican leaders tomorrow?
Pledge to VOTE TRUMP on November 3rd now.
Then give a donation from the heart—one that says “I Stand With Trump! God Bless America!”
Before you do anything else, ask yourself:
How badly do you want Trump to win?

President, [[URL REDACTED]]

Alex, have you seen Trump's tweets about Iran?
In case you missed it, Trump threatened to target and destroy Iran's cultural sites -- a legitimate war crime \-- and continues to say that if Iran retaliates, the U.S. will strike back ""quickly"" and in ""perhaps a disproportionate manner.""
Trump is dangerous and making military threats through Twitter, edging us closer and closer to war. We can't let it happen.
Add your name right now to DFA's petition calling on Congress to act NOW to stop war with Iran >>
Add your name
Alex, this is important.
Last night, news broke that the United States launched an airstrike in Iraq that killed a top military general of Iran.
It was an incredibly reckless, dangerous escalation in tensions between the U.S. and Iran, and many fear it means we’re on the brink of another endless, deadly war – this time with Iran.
There’s no time to waste: we the people need to stand up and demand Congress do their Constitutional duty by voting to stop a war with Iran ASAP. Add your name to our joint petition with Win Without War to make your voice heard now >>
ADD YOUR NAME
As Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren both pointed out, Donald Trump once criticized the Iraq war and even made promises to stop endless wars like it, but the truth is, yesterday’s military aggression towards Iran was no accident.
Since day one of his presidency, Trump has pushed our country towards a war with Iran. He filled his cabinet with warmongers like Mike Pompeo, pulled out of the historic and successful Iran nuclear deal, embarked on a “maximum pressure” campaign that sent thousands more U.S. troops to the Middle East, imposed crippling economic sanctions on Iran, and now, he oversaw the assassination of a senior Iranian military commander.
We’re now on the path to another potential World War III, and countless lives are at stake.
If you thought the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were bad, experts say a war with Iran would be even worse.
The power to declare war belongs in the hands of Congress, NOT the president. We need you to get loud in this moment of urgency and demand Congress step in and stop war with Iran now!
Together, we must rush to stop another endless war before it’s too late.
Thanks for taking action,
-Charles

Carpenters Union Thugs Are Attacking Our Signs
Hello Alex,
The most unbelievable thing happened the other day. A union, specifically the Southwest Carpenter’s Union, destroyed multiple of my large, very costly, campaign signs, and then stuck signs up that said this:
Sadly, while I said this is unbelievable, it really isn’t. Unions control politicians like Susie Lee, so they need to try to make sure she gets elected. This is because they know they will not be able to control me!
There is a police investigation into this criminal activity by Susie Lee’s thugs, activity that my team caught them on camera admitting. I intend to prosecute.
(Below is the 7 minute video of the Southwest Carpenters Union members admitting to the crime and trying to intimidate my staff)
Carpenters Union Admits to Vandalism and Harasses Rodimer Staff
In the meantime, I ask that you help me get my signs back up, and quickly. There are still people who haven’t voted and I need to make sure I reach those people so that we can turn this state RED. Can you contribute $25 right now to help make sure Susie Lee’s thugs don’t get away with what they did? That way we can fire Susie Lee and finally bring ethics back to our great state, when I am elected.

Jacob Blake is innocent. But that didn’t stop Kenosha police officers from shooting him 7 times in the back for no reason.

That’s why we’re demanding their immediate resignation. We need 100,000 activists signatures, sign now >>
JUSTICE FOR JACOB BLAKE: DEMAND THE POLICE CHIEF AND SHERIFF RESIGN IMMEDIATELY >>
justice must be served.
Jacob Blake was shot 7 times in the back while getting into his car. He was shot in front of his three small children. He spent the following days in the hospital fighting for his life.
“Dismantling systemic racism in our nation starts with demanding justice & holding offenders accountable.”
\-- Kamala Harris
Jacob Blake is innocent. But his innocence couldn’t protect him from the horrors of police brutality. Just like it couldn’t protect George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and countless more.
What makes this all even worse is that Kenosha cops were seen cozying up to white supremacists in the ensuing protests. Their racism runs deep.
We know that as long as Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis and Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth remain in their positions, there will NEVER be justice for David Blake.
So we’re calling for their immediate resignation in protest of racist police brutality.
We won’t rest until these offenders are held accountable for their crime. Sign on to demand the police chief and sheriff in Kenosha RESIGN →
JUSTICE FOR JACOB BLAKE: DEMAND THE POLICE CHIEF AND SHERIFF RESIGN IMMEDIATELY >>
Black Americans deserve the right to get into their own car, free from harm.
This is an injustice that cannot be ignored. And it will take an army of grassroots activists like you to finally be taken seriously.

View this email in your browser
Alex,
I’m SO PROUD to share with you that our grassroots campaign to replace Ted Yoho just got endorsed by United We Dream, the largest immigrant youth-led community in the country!
Stand with immigrant youth and Adam: chip in to help us replace Ted Yoho>>
From protecting DACA, to fighting ICE’s blatant abuse of human rights, to winning education access for immigrants, UWD has helped lead the fight for immigration justice. Their 400,000 members have put their bodies on the line to defend immigrants’ rights and stop unjust deportations.
That’s why I’m especially humbled by UWD’s faith in our youth-led campaign to fight for a Florida where all immigrants can live healthy and fulfilling lives without the fear of deportation, detention, family separation, or death.
You may know Rep. Ted Yoho as the misogynist who verbally assaulted AOC without a shred of remorse, or as 1 of only 4 people in Congress to vote against making lynching a federal crime. But as one of Trump’s closest allies in Congress, he’s also championed Trump’s hateful immigration agenda since day one.
Yoho cheerled Trump’s wall, proudly and unconditionally supports ICE and its concentration camps, applauded Trump’s gutting of DACA, and helped flame Trump’s fearmongering over immigrant caravans. He’s a threat to immigrant families’ safety and wellbeing not just in our district in Florida, but across the nation.
Chip in $17 today to help us replace him & flip FL-3 in November.
Our campaign is proud to stand with immigrant youth and fight for comprehensive, humane reforms that protect and uplift immigrant families. With your help, we will replace Trump minion Ted Yoho and take the fight for immigration justice to Congress.
In solidarity,
Adam

Alex, Donald Trump has been abusing his position since the first day he became president.
He’s used his power and influence to end criminal investigations and avoid conviction.
And Alex, enough is enough. Trump needs to be held accountable for his crimes.
But Congress will only charge Trump if it’s what the American people want.
That’s why we’re issuing an urgent public opinion poll today to gauge what our top supporters think. And Alex, we really need to hear from you:

SUPREME COURT RULING: Donald J. Trump Must Release His Tax Returns
'US Supreme Court rules Trump must turn over financial records' - Al Jazeera
100,000 URGENT SIGNATURES NEEDED TO FORCE DONALD J. TRUMP TO COMPLY WITH THE SUPREME COURT AND RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS >>

This petition is registered to [[EMAIL_REDACTED]]. Your signature is required before 11:59PM. Failure to sign could result in Trump getting off the hook for his crimes.
Alex -- It’s happening.
The Supreme Court ruled Donald Trump MUST hand over his taxes. Once his crimes are exposed, Trump will LOSE his bid for the White House!!
So Trump’s corrupt lawyers are fighting tooth and nail to COVER-UP his tax returns.
They’re ignoring the Supreme Court. It’s OUTRIGHT corruption!!
If we collect 100,000 signatures DEMANDING Trump’s tax returns → we can expose Trump for the FRAUD and LIAR that he is!
But that means we need your signature before midnight. Without your signature, Trump will go totally FREE. Can you SIGN NOW? We still need [7] signatures from 43620 to meet our goal! >>

For weeks, we have seen absolute destruction run rampant in the streets of America.
President Trump is fighting for Law and Order to be restored, but his Democratic adversaries seem to WELCOME this lawlessness!
But the lawlessness and unchecked crime goes beyond the riots from groups like ANTIFA, and into violence and even MURDER.
A recent analysis showed that in the nation’s 50 largest cities (mostly run by Liberal Democrats, of course), reported homicides were up 24% so far this year!
DEMAND LAW AND ORDER
If the Democrats can’t even maintain control of their cities and states, why on earth would we want to trust them with the nation?
If Joe Biden were to win, DEFUNDING THE POLICE and allowing violent rioters to control the narrative and policies would take center stage.
We need someone who is unafraid to stand up to the Liberal mob — WE NEED PRESIDENT TRUMP!
Take a stand before midnight to show that President Trump has your support and that you demand Law and Order in the streets of America! >>
Time is ticking! President Trump needs to know that his Law and Order initiative has your support!

43,"Alex,
The President of the United States has run a concentrated campaign to get his buddy Michael Flynn off the hook for lying to the Federal Bureau of Intelligence (FBI) about conversations he had with Russian government officials -- and unfortunately, as of yesterday, it worked.
The Department of Justice (or should I say, the Department of Injustice) announced their intentions to drop all charges against Michael Flynn.
(This isn’t the first time that Donald Trump has meddled in the legal system for his political pals -- he managed to get his friend Roger Stone a reduced sentence after public lobbying as well.)
Alex -- Let me be clear: this is a disgrace. It is a disgrace that someone who pleaded guilty -- someone who admitted they committed the crime -- to providing false information to the FBI about his conversations with a foreign power has gotten off scot free because they are cronies of the President.
And Attorney General William Barr has been aiding and abetting Donald Trump every step of the way. When questioned about why someone who pleaded guilty was being let off the hook, Barr went on CBS News to say that “people sometimes plead to things that turn out not to be crimes” \-- it makes absolutely no sense.
Will you join me in standing up to this Department of Injustice, Alex? Will you sign my petition demanding that William Barr resign and that integrity get restored to our Justice Department? We’ve gotten thousands of signatures on past petitions calling on Barr to resign, but this new offense requires reinvigorated grassroots action to DEMAND change.
It is clear that integrity does not come naturally to this administration, so we must join together to demand it.
In solidarity,
Hank

# Choose You This Day
July 1, 2020
Dear Alex,
Choose you this day. Those words are familiar. It is likely that you have already finished the phrase in your mind.
In his final address, to the nation of Israel, Joshua stood before the nation that he had led into the Promised Land. He reminded them of God's providential care. He reminded them of God's abundant blessings.
Joshua also warned them of the danger that lurked and would attack the foundation of their freedom. Then Joshua challenged the people to make a willful, conscious, decision to choose.
Joshua concluded with his decision. ""As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."" (Joshua 24:15)
Today, America stands at the point of decision. We are in a time like never before.
The primary issues today are no longer about the size of government, tax policy, or regulation. Today we see mob violence, destruction, and an intentional, planned, assault on America.
What began as calls for the removal of memorial statues, has now taken on the face of mob destruction and violence. Today statues of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt are not only criticized but defaced and damaged.
Princeton University removed Woodrow Wilson's name from its Public Policy Center. The Democrat Party in Orange County, California called for the renaming of the John Wayne airport because of comments he made in an interview with Playboy magazine half a century ago.
This mob frenzy has surpassed mere political correctness. It has now metastasized into a cancer that is out to destroy America itself.
Democrats blame President Trump for the violence while at the same time they call for abolishing the police. Seattle handed over several blocks of the city to a lawless mob who apparently could not settle on the name of their newly formed republic, ""Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone"" (CHAZ) or ""Capitol Hill Organized Protest"" (CHOP).
In the first month of CHAZ/CHOP, there were at least six shootings. After three shootings in a 48 hour time frame, one being fatal, the Mayor of Seattle boldly proclaimed that the city ""will not allow for gun violence to continue in the evenings around Capitol Hill.""
The Mayor's proclamation was so effective that 72 hours later there was another shooting. A week later yet another shooting left a 16 year old dead and a 14 year old in critical condition.
Meanwhile, Democrats, including Sanford Bishop, are characteristically silent about the lawlessness, crime, destruction, and decay. The problem is that Democrats have controlled these areas for decades. What happened in a matter of weeks in CHAZ/CHOP was just Democrat leadership on steroids.
Today, America stands at a critical crossroads. The violence and destruction that we see around our nation share no DNA with the values of the people of the 2nd District.
I am speaking up and standing up for your values. I am speaking up and standing up for you as I challenge Sanford Bishop.
I need you to stand with me. I need you to put skin in the game with me.
I am regularly asked if the Republican party will support our race. Yes they will, but they need to see that the people of the 2nd District are standing up. Now is the time to take a stand.
When you donate to Don Cole for Congress, the money stays with my campaign and is focused right here on my campaign. Your contribution will go to promote your values and you can count on that.
You may have never donated to a political campaign before. Now is the time, today is the day.
We are at a time as never before. Right now, you, not anyone else, but you stand at a point of decision.
Some of my readers have already given generously and sacrificially. If you have not given to my campaign yet, then I ask you to do it now.
The number of individual donors is just as important as how much the donors give. Will you put some skin in the game by donating as little as $2.20 (2nd District in 20) or $20.20 (Send DC to DC in 2020)?

45,"We’re helping launch the biggest grassroots program in the general election It’s been a huge -- and infuriating -- few days for our work on impeachment, and we know Indivisibles across the country are doing everything possible to hold Trump accountable for his crimes. We also know that McConnell and his cronies in the Senate will stop at nothing to protect Trump, and will likely vote to acquit him this week. That means that removing Trump is up to us. That’s why we’re partnering with powerful allies to get Trump out of office for good, and why we’re emailing you about that today, on Iowa caucus day.
Indivisibles,
It’s Iowa caucus day, and Indivisibles across the nation are hard at work. But the primary isn’t the end of the line. We’re also thinking hard about the general election, which is why we’re excited to share some big news: today, we’re announcing Organizing Together 2020 -- our no-longer-secret plan to beat Trump in key battleground states!
Here’s the deal: while Democrats are rightfully busy vetting a nominee, Donald Trump has gotten a months-long head start on the general election campaign in key battleground states. We know that if we wait until July to prepare for the general election then we’ll lose. So Indivisible isn’t waiting.
Today we’re co-launching Organizing Together 2020.
Organizing Together 2020 is a big new coalition that is setting up dozens of canvassing offices in the key battleground states of Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. We’ll be recruiting and training election volunteers NOW instead of waiting for July when the nominee is officially chosen.
By the time we have a nominee, Organizing Together 2020 will have swing state staff hired, volunteers trained, offices buzzing, canvasses running, and resources mobilized and ready to win in the general election. Indivisible is a founding partner co-launching the effort today, and we’re working with partners from labor and groups like Vote Vets and People for the American Way to make this a very big deal.
Right now, we’ve raised about half of the budget to get this done, but we have another $440,000 left to raise to fully fund Indivisible’s part of it. Can you chip in $10 to support Organizing Together 2020 and all of our work? Every cent you donate to Indivisible Action will go towards defeating Trump and saving our democracy.
What comes next? We start building the army to defeat Trump. We’re planning to reach thousands of voters in every one of these key battleground states before the general election on November 3rd. That’s not going to be easy, but as always, we’ve got a plan to make it happen:
1. Open dozens of canvass offices throughout key battleground states, because we know that early infrastructure is the key to scaling up for the general election.
2. Drive thousands of volunteers to those offices throughout the election cycle. We are investing in our people early so that they are able to have the most effective conversations possible. We will need every single one of them in order to win.
3. Train those volunteers to be effective canvassers -- knocking on millions of doors across the country to persuade voters and get out the vote. Face to face conversations are the best way to persuade voters and turn them out to vote. We need to rely on best canvassing practices and massive scale.
4. After the Democratic convention in July, be ready with a massive on-the-ground movement that will be ready to support the nominee and put them in office.
Yes, it costs money to do this. We’re looking to raise $440,000 in grassroots donations. Our piece of this partnership is organizing and volunteer recruitment, so that budget is mostly things like organizing tools (our SMS tool, Hubdialer, an email platform, etc.), data tools and analysis (that’s how we figure out which voters to talk to and how), electoral trainings for groups, and volunteer and organizing staff in all six states.
We say it all the time, but our work truly isn’t possible without you. We’re up against a lot of entrenched interests with a LOT of money: according to CNBC, Trump’s campaign had $102 million in his war-chest going into this year (and that’s before you count all the dark money super PACs spending to reelect him).
We don’t have to match every dollar they spend: our power comes from individual people not from hundred dollar bills. But we do need to raise enough to pay for the tools and resources that support all those thousands of volunteers.
That’s why we’re asking you to help us make Organizing Together 2020 a reality. Can you make a $10 donation to launch this new initiative, support Indivisible Action, and put all our plans for this year in motion?
If you’ve saved your information with ActBlue Express Lane, your donation to Indivisible Action will go through immediately:

One last note on the primaries: we know a lot of people have a lot of differing opinions. In truth, some of our partners on this project have very different opinions than we do about the primaries! But any disagreements pale compared to this: we all agree that we absolutely must defeat Donald Trump this year.
We’re going to keep engaging in the primaries in ways that make sense for us, with input from you, the movement. But while that’s happening, and in the spirit of the Indivisible Pledge, we’re getting ready for the main event. And we’re building the infrastructure we’ll need to come together as a progressive movement once the nominee is chosen in July. We hope you’re ready to join us.
In solidarity,

We just rolled out a brand new slate of 35 endorsements! Even though it's only January, we've already endorsed 125 candidates for the 2020 cycle. We're gearing up to shatter our previous endorsement records and elect a record number of LGBTQ candidates. Will you chip in $20.20 and help us create a Rainbow Revolution on Election Day?
I'm so excited to show you our latest round of candidates - they've all proven they're ready to win. And, we're announcing three new candidates for the United States Senate and House, as well as candidates for down-ballot races. Take a look:
JanEndorsements
In the battle to reclaim the U.S. Senate for pro-equality forces, Ross LaJeunesse has tossed his hat into the ring. When he wins the Democratic primary, Ross will tackle sitting Senator Susan Collins. Collins has long followed the marching orders of the Trump Administration and has yet to stand against Mitch McConnell's anti-LGBTQ agenda. Winning this seat could mean we can finally pass the pro-equality legislation that McConnell has shoved to the back burner! Chip in to destroy Mitch's majority and send Susan Collins packing. Donate $20.20 or more today!

And we're getting ready to DOUBLE LGBTQ representation in the U.S. House. We're proud to stand with Pat Hackett in Indiana and Tracy Mitrano in New York. Pat will face anti-LGBTQ incumbent Rep. Jackie Walorski, known for derailing hate crimes legislation as a state representative and voting to support LGBTQ discrimination as a Congresswoman. And both Pat and Tracy will make history as the first openly LGBTQ person elected to Congress in their states!
We've got a lot of work to do, Alex, and a lot of big races to win. Taking down Susan Collins, Jackie Walorski and a slate of other anti-LGBTQ candidates will not be easy. To make history, we need you on our team. Will you donate $20.20 or more to win?

Team — Donald Trump is unhinged, and has once again taken to Twitter to put Americans and the global community at large in even more danger than he did with his reckless actions against Iran yesterday. So we’re asking:
Will you sign the VoteVets petition today? We’re demanding Congress act immediately to stop a catastrophic war with Iran and put a check on President Trump's erratic foreign policy actions. Click here to sign >>
SIGN THE PETITION
First, he escalated tensions by pulling out of the Iran deal. Then, he acted without authorization from Congress and directed a drone strike that assassinated Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top military leader.
Earlier today when asked about his exit strategy he said, “I don’t need exit strategies.”
And now he’s threatening to bomb and destroy 52 cultural sites in Iran, which means he’s officially threatening war crimes on his Twitter account.
He has not considered the consequences of any of these actions. He has no plan. He has no strategy.
Sign the petition right now to join veterans and military families in demanding Congress put a check on Trump’s irresponsible and erratic behavior in order to stop a catastrophic war with Iran:
SIGN THE PETITION
While Trump is in his third week of vacation, he’s putting thousands of Americans and Iranians in greater danger by the hour.
That’s why we need you to join us in calling for action from Congress today.
If you’ve already signed, consider forwarding this link and inviting 5 of your friends and family who also want Congress to take action immediately to stop Trump:

Dear Alex,
When America’s greatness comes only at the expense of others, we all lose. Sadly, I was reminded of this important truth last weekend when Senator Tom Cotton referred to slavery as being “the necessary evil upon which the union was built.”
It is easy to see Cotton’s remarks are disturbing –– even more so when we consider he made this statement to defend his opposition to teaching about the history of slavery in our schools. But, we also should remember that the notion that evil is sometimes necessary for prosperity is not a relic of history or limited to academic debates.
Yesterday on Medium, I dug into Cotton’s remarks and what they mean about how we justify evil today with a piece titled Evil Is Never Necessary In America.
Today in America, business executives accept cutting jobs as a “necessary evil” for improving a company’s quarterly earnings. Policymakers accept warehousing lawbreakers, especially if poor and Black, as a “necessary evil” to reducing crime.
The idea that slavery was a necessary part of America’s founding implies that for some to flourish in our country others must be hurt. As you can read more of my thoughts on Medium, we cannot let these kinds of ideas win out. At a time when the public is collectively examining what our responsibilities are to each other and how to account for the inequality we have tolerated for so long, it behooves us to reconsider and to reject the kinds of “necessary evils” we have accepted before.
Together we can and we must do better.
Sincerely,
Deval Patrick

####  Virginia lawmakers push to expand police decertification law
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press
A white Virginia state trooper yells an expletive-laden threat at a Black motorist who refuses to get out of his car during a traffic stop. Smiling for the driver’s cellphone camera, the trooper remarks, “Watch the show, folks,” then yanks the man out of his car by his neck. The video sparked outrage in Virginia, but under current state law, the trooper’s conduct — unless he’s later convicted of a crime — is not grounds for disqualifying him from working in law enforcement.

####  Computer hackers attack Fairfax County school system
By JOE HEIM, Washington Post (Metered Paywall - 3 articles a month)
Hackers attacked the Fairfax County Public Schools computer system and placed ransomware on some of its systems, a school district spokesperson said Friday. The district, which serves 189,000 students in northern Virginia, said it had recently learned of the attack and it is working with its security experts to investigate the scope of the attack and determine what information was stolen. Ransomware is software used to steal and then threaten publication of data or block access unless a ransom is paid.

By ABIGAIL CONSTANTINO, WTOP
The first week of virtual learning in Loudoun County, Virginia, was interrupted by incidents of students using racial slurs, displaying sexual images or popping into the virtual sessions of other classes or schools. “These incidents are contrary to our core beliefs, our commitment to racial equity and other matters of equity as described in the LCPS Equity Statement, and to the expectations we have established for appropriate behavior by students in the virtual environment,” Williams said in a news release.

Virginia Tech likely won’t send students packing this fall, because a shift to all-online classes would do little to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, President Tim Sands said Friday. “I won’t say categorically that we won’t change direction, but, to be perfectly honest, I think what we’re learning is that going remote wouldn’t help that much,” Sands told students at an hour-long virtual town hall.

####  ICE flew detainees to Virginia so the planes could transport agents to D.C. protests
By ANTONIO OLIVO AND NICK MIROFF, Washington Post (Metered Paywall - 3 articles a month)
The Trump administration flew immigrant detainees to Virginia this summer to facilitate the rapid deployment of Homeland Security tactical teams to quell protests in Washington, circumventing restrictions on the use of charter flights for employee travel, according to a current and a former U.S. official. After the transfer, dozens of the new arrivals tested positive for the novel coronavirus, fueling an outbreak at the Farmville, Va., immigration jail that infected more than 300 inmates, one of whom died.

####  King William County Commissioner of the Revenue refuses to cooperate with audit, emails show
By EMILY HOLTER, Tidewater Review
King William Commissioner of the Revenue Sally Pearson refused, on several occasions, to let auditors in her office Sept. 2, according to email correspondence between high-level county officials. Pearson’s refusal to participate in the audit comes nearly six weeks after she declined to take part in the county’s reassessment process, one of the essential functions of her office. It was the reassessment, during which it was revealed that hundreds of properties weren’t being taxed, that prompted County Administrator Bobbie Tassinari to initiate the performance audit of Pearson’s office.

####  Federal grant to help redevelop, reconnect once-segregated pocket of Norfolk
By RYAN MURPHY, Virginian-Pilot (Metered Paywall - 2 articles a month)
The three 1950s-era public housing communities in Norfolk’s St. Paul’s area have long been isolated, surrounded by busy roads and largely cut off from city cross streets. The design is a remnant of racist housing policies that aimed to keep poor and Black residents stuck in their own neighborhoods. A new $14.4 million federal grant announced Friday could change that, helping to reconnect the area to more pedestrian-friendly city streets once St. Paul’s is redeveloped.

By JANE HARPER, Virginian-Pilot (Metered Paywall - 2 articles a month)
Legislation that would have made it easier for citizens to sue police officers for misconduct died this week in Richmond, but that didn’t stop several Virginia Beach leaders from gathering Friday to speak against it. Less than 24 hours after the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 12-3 to kill HB 5013, Mayor Bobby Dyer and Sheriff Ken Stolle met at the city jail with several local legislators, City Council members and law enforcement officials to make their opinions known. “The system worked yesterday,” Stolle said of the committee’s decision. “But we will see this bill again. It’s not a done deal.”

####  Virginia Supreme Court dismisses challenge to wording of redistricting amendment
By MEL LEONOR, Richmond Times-Dispatch (Access to this article limited to subscribers)
The Supreme Court of Virginia has rejected a challenge to the wording of a ballot question tied to a constitutional amendment on redistricting. The lawsuit alleged that the question is “misleading” and “inaccurate,” and written in a way that leaves voters in the dark about the key effects of the amendment on the state’s redistricting process. It asked the Supreme Court of Virginia to compel state election officials to correct it.

Trump-Pence yard signs lined the two-lane road she had driven to get here, proof of the battle the first-term Democrat faces in defending her seat from Republican challenger Nick Freitas.

The number of travelers using Norfolk International Airport dropped by 59% in August to 160,547 passengers, compared with 391,682 a year ago. The steep drop reflects the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on air travel, but the situation has been improving each month since the health crisis prompted stay-at-home orders and shutdowns. Traffic year-over-year was down 64% in July, 75% in June, 87% in May and 94% in April.

Roanoke Times Editorial (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month)
Some things are too good to be true. That inheritance from the Nigerian prince. The promise that “one size fits all.” Those pop-up ads that promise “single girls in your area are dying to meet you.” And the fevered claim that has rocketed around the mediasphere that Washington & Lee University is teaching students “how to overthrow the state.” This seemed to fit perfectly into the mindset that academia is an elitist enclave of radicals who are busily molding impressionable young minds to hate America.

As a Cadet at Virginia Military Institute, I learned to put service above self.

Be a person of character. Frankly, in this moment, we need people of character at the helm more than ever — leaders who understand service over self-interest.

####  Preis: Qualified immunity and government accountability
By JOHN F. PREIS, published in Richmond Times-Dispatch (Metered Paywall - 7 articles a month)
If a cop violates your constitutional rights, should you be entitled to any money? That’s a question the Virginia General Assembly has been debating regarding an obscure legal doctrine called “qualified immunity.” Most people are surprised to learn that you can’t necessarily get compensation when a police officer violates your rights. After all, the rest of us have to pay for the harms we cause.
John F. Preis is a professor of law and associate dean in the University of Richmond School of Law.
