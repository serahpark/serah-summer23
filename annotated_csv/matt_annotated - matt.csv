# Primary Season is Over in the 4th!
### Help Me Reach My End of The Month Goal!
Dear Patriot,
If you haven’t gotten my messages, I’m Leon Benjamin—a black conservative pastor, veteran, a surrogate for President Trump, and I’m an unapologetic Conservative!
I am running against Socialist gun-grabber Donald McEachin, who stands alongside Racist Joe Biden, in Virginia’s 4th District!
We have an urgent fundraising deadline less than a week away!
At the end of the month, the fundraising quarter will end and we need to give a strong showing to demonstrate our legitimacy as a campaign!
Will you help me hit my goal?
Please donate today and help me get over the line!
*YES, I WILL HELP YOU MEET YOUR GOAL*
I was born and raised in district in Richmond, Virginia.
Richmond has always been my home and its where I am raising my two wonderful kids with my wife of 28 years, Maria.
When our country went to war in the Persian Gulf War, my country needed me. As a Navy reservist, I was deployed to fight for freedom. I served on the USS John F. Kennedy.
Many brave men and women put their lives on the line beside me in service to our country. Our freedom was won by the blood of patriots.
Freedom is never free.
After I got home, the Lord called me into the ministry.
I’ve pastored a church here in Richmond for more than a decade. God has called me to serve the people of Richmond.
I’ve also had the honor of representing the President as a minority surrogate, arguing for the President’s agenda on Fox News and other cable news outlets.
I’ve always been a strong supporter of the President!
Socialist McEachin is nothing but a rabid anti-Trumper trying to undermine him at all costs! He doesn’t care about his district.
I’ve watched as Democrats take the black vote for granted and time and time again pass over our inner-city communities. The only time they remotely care is when it’s election time.
Black lives don’t matter to them. Black votes matter.
That’s all I am to Racist Joe Biden.
That’s why God called me to run for Congress! We need true conservative leadership in Washington!
We need someone who will fight for OUR values!
Will you help me beat Socialist McEachin?
Please donate today to my campaign and help me stop Socialism!
*STOP SOCIALISM!*
This country is burning as Socialists are attempting a full-scale insurrection! And Socialists like McEachin are fanning the flames!
In Seattle, Leftist terrorists occupied six city blocks and declared they seceded from the United States to establish their own communist state!
The Leftist mayor of Seattle turned tail and ran! She ordered police to stand down and let them have the precinct! Now, they’ve erected walls!
They built a wall, are violently enforcing border security, screening everyone coming in and out with ID checks, and have armed guards with AR-15s and AK-47s patrolling the wall!
These same communists were screaming racist because Trump wanted a strong border with Mexico—and they’ve gone and done the same thing.
These Leftists are also terrorizing their own people. They are exhorting businesses, beating anyone up that doesn’t agree with them, and are violently enforcing their own laws:
The official also added that leaders in the anti-cop zone are ""starting to extort money from the local businesses within the border for 'protection.'""
Rapper Raz Simone also declared himself warlord. This is a full-scale Marxist dystopia ruled by a violent warlord and armed guards!
Now, crimes are being committed left and right in the autonomous zone and the police have not been allowed access inside to get to these calls:
“Our calls for service have more than tripled,” she told reporters. “These are responses to emergency calls — rapes, robberies, and all sorts of violent acts that have been occurring in the area that we’re not able to get to.”
There have been two shootings in the last 48 hours alone in the autonomous zone! This is what the world looks like without cops!
We need our police and this Leftist scum are trying to completely abolish them!
I will stand with President Trump for our law enforcement and against this insanity!
Will you help me?
Please donate today and send a conservative warrior that will always Back the Blue!
*BACK THE BLUE!*
Now, other cities are trying to overthrow our police and spread this Socialist insurrection!
In Washington DC, protestors tried to form an autonomous zone and pull down a statue of Andrew Jackson!
In my native Richmond, the Lee statue has become a hotspot of armed, violent protestors to gather! They’ve started trying to make barricades with cars around the statues!
This is just disgusting and needs to be stopped immediately!
Governor Blackface Northam has YET to address this! He and Socialist McEachin are looking the other way at this sickening violence and just pretending it isn’t happening!
They don’t care about black lives. Dozens of black police officers have been killed and wounded across America by leftist terrorists and anarchists! Not a single Democrat said a word.
Hundreds of black men and women have been shot in the last few weeks in Chicago and Baltimore. Not a single word of condemnation.
Here in Richmond, our black community is victimized by drug and gang violence. And the entire police force has to fight a bunch of rioters every night as black men and women die!
These Socialist Democrats don’t care about black lives: all they care about are black votes. They are fanning the flames of violence and watching America burn to the ground—all so they can win an election!
This is disgusting and evil!
Our Richmond police headquarters was attacked by an armed gang that threw bombs, bottles, and bricks at police! They attempted to burn down the HQ. Luckily, our police stood their ground.
Meanwhile, our Leftist mayor had his apartment complex broken into by a crowd of protestors! And he had an army of private security to force them out!
What a disgusting hypocrite! He wants to disarm us, take away all police, and hires private security?!
It’s time to kick these hypocrites out of office!
Help me take back this district from Socialist McEachin! Donate today and help me win!
STOP SOCIALISM!*
The end of the fundraising quarter is at the end of month! We have less than a week to hit our fundraising goal!
We are trying to raise $30,000 dollars! So far, we’ve raised $27,563!
We’re so close! Can you help push us over the edge?
Please donate today and help me take back our country!

Securing the Border from Your Hometown
Published on February 2, 2020
Joe Walz
U.S. House of Representatives Texas CD-22 Candidate
There is no doubt in my mind or in the laws of physics that a wall is an effective method of preventing someone or something from going from point A to point B.
What else do we need to fund? What other programs need reform or abolishment? One of the biggest ways to stop chain migration and remove the proverbial carrot would be to stop birth-right citizenship and maternity tourism. These things subvert the intent of our federal immigration laws and I will fight to stop them.
Technology exists to significantly reduce the burden on our men and women at Customs and Border Patrol. We need to equip the USCBP with these forms of deterrent and detection. That all helps, but what if your Sheriff could start removing illegal immigrants him or herself?
I present to you the Immigration and Customs Enforcement 287g Program. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) 287(g) Program enhances the safety and security of communities by creating partnerships with state and local law enforcement agencies to identify and remove aliens who are amenable to removal from the United States.
Put simply, the 287g program gives a law enforcement agency the equipment and authorizations to interview immigrants, check Department of Homeland Security databases, issue detainers to hold individuals until ICE takes custody, enter information into the ICE case management system, and issue the Notice to Appear – the first steps required for removal.
A Sheriff could literally start the deportation process from within his jail. A proactive Sheriff could even arrange a voluntary removal, to include arranging transportation back to home country for the individual. Sheriff Louderback of Jackson County, Texas has enrolled his county and doubles down by giving presentations on the program to various groups like the one Fort Bend Republican Patriots Club received from him a few years ago. Perhaps that’s why Sheriff Louderback is often seen with President Donald Trump in The White House.
Sheriffs that are opposed to 287g use inflated figures and fictional numbers to make it seem like not enrolling in the program has its merits in fiscal responsibility. These notions could not be further from the truth. The cost of illegal immigrant crimes, societal costs, and the damage done to families victimized by criminal illegal aliens far outweigh the costs presented by soft on immigration Sheriffs.
My county Sheriff briefed his constituents at multiple events that he was not going to participate. He stood by and played a video he produced - instead of telling the people directly what his intent was and why. Look at the examples below, both deported after being detained by a law enforcement office enrolled in 287g.
New Jersey – On May 23, 2019, a Designated Immigration Officer from the Monmouth County, NJ 287(g) Program encountered a citizen of Mexico charged with luring-enticing a child, sex assault victim under 13, lewdness, endangering-sexual conduct with a child. The subject entered the United States on an unknown date and location without inspection. The Monmouth County 287(g) Program placed an immigration detainer, Form I-247A, and warrant on the subject who will be served a Notice to Appear.
South Carolina – On March 13, 2019, a Designated Immigration Officer from the Charleston County, SC Sheriff’s Office 287(g) Program encountered a citizen of Mexico who was charged with criminal sexual conduct with a minor second degree – victim 11 to 14 years of age. The individual had previously been removed. The Charleston County 287(g) Program placed an immigration detainer, Form I-247A, and warrant on the subject who will be served with a Notice of Intent/Decision to Reinstate Prior Order.
The State of Texas tasks elected Sheriffs with the duty to uphold public safety within their county. When every other Republican Sheriff in the vicinity of Fort Bend County is participating, one must ask how is it that these smaller counties with less revenue and less illegal immigrant crime are able to participate. I am not lost as to why the democrat Sheriffs are not participating. That is what makes the GOP known for being tough on illegal immigration. We as a party tend to be more proactive and less sympathetic to the illegal, and more concerned with the welfare of citizens and LEGAL immigrants we serve.
This would serve as a proactive manner of dealing with human trafficking and drug trafficking occurring right here in Fort Bend. If the families only knew that there was a way those things could have been prevented from within our own county’s departments.
No new officers must be hired. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement pays a major portion of the detention cost. Statistics from counties like Gwinnett County, Georgia saw a long-term reduction in average daily jail population directly correlating with their 287g participation. That long-term savings is how you judge whether a program is fiscally sensible or not. Business-minded folks know, sometimes you must spend a little money to make money. 287g fits this model perfectly. For the costs of travel and hotels, a Sheriff could reduce his long-term average jail population. There’s the nugget of gold. Not to mention, the enhancement of public safety in the jurisdiction.
As the Representative for Texas’ 22nd District in 2020 – I will assist our new Sheriff by filling the gap between the cost to house an inmate and what ICE reimburses the jail. Nullifying that excuse could encourage thousands of agencies to participate. Keeping in mind there may be some work for the jails to work to reduce that cost per day figure as well.

2,"For months, Donald Trump downplayed the risk of the global health pandemic, and now he's desperate to find someone to blame...
""Trump move to end WHO funding amid coronavirus fight criticized""
–NBC News, April 15
Alex –
First it was the media.
Then it was Democratic governors.
Now, it's the World Health Organization.
For months, Donald Trump downplayed the risk of the global health pandemic – even calling the whole thing Democrats' ""new hoax"" at rallies – as he ignored briefings telling him to prepare for the worst.
Now, he's desperately looking for someone to blame for his failure to act – and his latest move is to cut $400 MILLION from the World Health Organization, right in the middle of the pandemic.
This is absolutely enraging, Alex: We CANNOT give Trump and his state Republican enablers a pass for yet again endangering millions of Americans' health by cutting funding to the only global organization capable of responding to this pandemic.
Alex, we need your voice urgently: Speak out now and DEMAND that Congress reverse Trump's order and restore funding for the W.H.O. >>
ADD MY NAME →
Prominent voices are already joining this call. Bill Gates says Trump's decision is ""as dangerous as it sounds"" because if the W.H.O.'s work on coronavirus is cut back, ""no other organization can replace them.""
The editor-in-chief of The Lancet, a prominent medical journal, went even further – calling the funding cuts ""a crime against humanity"" and warning that ""every scientist, every health worker, every citizen must resist and rebel against this appalling betrayal of global solidarity.""
There's no way to sugarcoat this: Lives will be lost if we turn our backs on science and let Trump's business-as-usual prevail. That's why we have to mobilize and reject Trump's W.H.O. cuts now.
Speak out IMMEDIATELY to urge Congress to reject Trump's W.H.O. cuts, before his incompetence gets even more Americans killed >>

3,"Are you and I ""pro-crime?"" Let me explain what Parson's PAC is saying in a new wave of attacks filled with shocking and obvious lies.
# Nicole Galloway for Missouri
Earlier today, Parson's PAC launched a new wave of attacks filled with shocking and obvious lies, like accusing me and supporters like you of being ""pro-crime.""
I won't dignify these offensive and false attacks with a response. But I will tell you what it says about this race: The status quo is running scared.
In a moment, I'll ask you for your help to fight back — but first, let me explain.
On Governor Parson's watch, everyday families have struggled with rising healthcare costs, underfunded schools and fewer opportunities — all while insiders and mega-donors have been raking in favors and kickbacks. When I'm governor, that all comes to an end — and the folks in power know it.
When we launched this campaign, early polls had us down against Parson by double digits. Now more than a year, multiple fundraising records, and millions of calls and texts later, our grassroots movement has made Missouri a battleground state. The billionaires and special interests are spinning up outrageous lies every week because they're panicking — as they should be.
As Auditor, I've been the taxpayers’ independent watchdog. I've uncovered more than $370 million in wasted or stolen taxpayer money and brought more than 60 criminal counts against corrupt public officials from both political parties. When I say I'll end their culture of corruption, they know it's no BS — that's why I'm running to defeat Mike Parson, and it's why I'm asking for your support today:
Will you add a donation of $5 or whatever you can to my campaign so we can set the record straight for undecided voters before Election Day? We can’t settle for a bought-and-paid-for system any longer — not during this pandemic and not for what comes next — so your donation right now is critical.
Thanks for making a difference when it matters most,
Nicole

* He refused to divest from his business interests.
* He pardoned his friends and campaign staffers for crimes they committed in his name.

* And all that was before he pressured voters to commit crimes by casting their ballot twice in the upcoming election.

8,"We can elect candidates who are more than just talk.
Alex,
Today we have big news out of San Francisco: District Attorney Chesa Boudin has ended the use of cash bail in all criminal cases!
Previously, when people were arrested in a criminal case they were held in jail until their trial unless they could they could provide “cash bail”—a large amount of money—to the court. The money is later returned if the defendant appears at all their court dates, though this can be weeks or even months later.
This system unfairly targeted low income people whose families are less likely to have cash on-hand. This means that low income defendants who have not been convicted of a crime were held in jail longer than their wealthy peers and lose their job or worse.
Today’s news is an example of how quickly we can make change when we elect progressive candidates. Can you chip in $15 to help us get to Congress today?

Ending cash bail was one of Chesa’s campaign promises, and one of the many reasons I endorsed and campaigned alongside him.
The more progressives we elect to office the more we can accomplish.
Bernie Sanders spoke out in support of Chesa Boudin’s decision today and of ending cash bail nationwide. In order to accomplish this, it’s critical that we not only elect Bernie as President but that we elect a progressive congress ready to support his agenda.

MY CANDIDATE STATEMENT
Ronald Reagan proclaimed our country as a Beacon of Light and a Shining City on a Hill, but right now we are not reaching our potential as a country.
We need leaders with solutions. We need leaders that can relate to the struggles of everyday people. Most importantly, we need leaders that value honesty and new ideas.
I understand your struggles and I am bringing new ideas, the needed experience and a fresh perspective to the table that will help restore the American dream.
As a business owner and concerned citizen, I worry for the future of Californian families. We have high taxes, increased crime, inadequate enforcement of immigration laws and growing poverty rates.
In Orange County, rents are skyrocketing, homelessness is on the rise, and regardless of party, leaders are not acting in good faith to the great people they represent.
The last thing we need right now are more career politicians. It is time for change and I will never stop fighting on behalf of you!
I am running on a Pro-Constitution, American Family Values and Common-Sense Conservative platform. Once I am your Congressman, we will Make Orange County Great Again!
My campaign is For Our Country and For Our Future. I graciously ask for your vote in this upcoming election. I encourage you to go to my website, [[URL REDACTED]], to read my story and my platform.

10,"The candidates will make their pitches for how they can defeat Trump, but we can't stop there.
Friend –
Seven Democratic candidates are gearing up to take the stage tonight in New Hampshire. With just four days before the first-in-the-nation primary, the stakes have never been higher. But that's not the only reason why:
Trump's acquittal this week, orchestrated by Mitch McConnell in a trial with no witnesses or evidence, means that the only way to hold Republicans accountable is at the ballot box.
Since Senate Republicans refused to take Trump's crimes seriously, it's up to us to defeat his agenda and his allies in the states. That starts with a strong leader at the top of the ticket – and the seven amazing candidates on stage tonight.
If winning in November is the only way to make Republicans pay for their actions, we need to start gearing up now to take victory at every single level.
The stakes have never been higher. Before the debate starts, chip in $10 to help defeat Trump's allies and elect more state Democrats >>

By acquitting Trump for crimes he openly admitted committing, Republicans tried to absolve themselves of any and all responsibility to the Constitution. That's what makes the 2020 elections so crucial.
This fight is far from over. It will continue in tonight's Democratic debate, then tomorrow when we keep organizing and mobilizing like never before. We need everyone to take part.
Tonight, the attention will shift from Trump's crimes and the Republicans' coverup, to the Democrats leading the charge against them. We MUST use this moment to seize the advantage. Pitch in $10 tonight to elect state Democrats and hold corrupt Republicans accountable >>

11,"Alex,
Last week the MNGOP, the House Republican Caucus and the Senate Republican Caucus unleashed it’s animosity toward MAGASOTA, its members and insulted grassroots activists across the state.
From the moment MAGASOTA launched we have been under attack. Sadly those attacks have been lies, mischaracterizations and smear campaigns. They have been constant and ongoing by RINOs and other activists who supposedly support our president.
Thursday the MNGOP led by chair Jennifer Carnahan, the Senate Republican Caucus led by Senator Paul Gazelka and House Minority leader Kurt Daudt , with your tax dollars, created a website that features MAGASOTA, a pro life group and a pro gun group as scammers.
This is a serious allegation that has no merit. They are accusing us of something criminal. No crime has been committed. No one has been scammed. It is truly pathetic to know that our elected officials who are paid by our tax dollars would spend your tax money and waste valuable time going after Trump supporters.
The swamp is alive and well right here in St Paul. Why aren’t they putting effort into denouncing America hating Ilhan Omar? Why aren’t they lowering our taxes? Why are they funding the fraudulent DHS? Why do they continue to infringe on our rights? Why are they voting on unconstitutional omnibus bills and funding abortion? Why are they giving themselves a raise?
Who are the real scammers?
They would rather spend time and money going after taxpayers, voters, grassroots activists, Trump supporters and people who love freedom and liberty- Americans.
This is the most outrageous attack on MAGASOTA and members. This is a Minnesota version of what President Trump has gone through in DC. Tragically the MNGOP is attacking it’s very own supporters. The Trump haters in this state are coming out of the closet. Are they afraid of losing their power? Are they afraid of WE THE PEOPLE?
MAGASOTA’s mission has been clear from the beginning and hasn’t changed. We are here to win Minnesota for President Trump.
This attack is sickening and without merit, tarnishing the reputation of the good people working for President Trump. It’s a play straight out of Saul Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals.
MAGASOTA will not be stopped. We know our supporters and members see right through the slander and libel, and will continue to work for President Trump. Read what they published on their website about MAGASOTA.
“ these scammers aren’t affiliated with the official campaign in any way, shape or form.”
“The MAGAsota folks are diverting valuable volunteer time to an effort that will have a marginal effect on the actual election. Remember, Minnesota has not voted for a Republican Presidential candidate since 1972 so it will take everyone “rowing the boat” in the same direction”
“There has never been a more robust effort in the state of Minnesota. Efforts like MAGAsota look good on the surface but without coordination with the real campaigns, ultimately result in a waste of valuable volunteer time.”
So because we are not affiliated with the “official campaign” our efforts will be marginal? Diverting valuable volunteer time? No -we are actually doing the work.
Do you really think President Trump would support this kind of BS? No. He would not. He would welcome any support and effort put forth on his behalf.
President Trump has been the outsider and remains the outsider. He is working to drain the swamp-not be a part of it.
Then on Friday the MNGOP sent an email to everyone in the state standing behind their false allegations of scamming. Let me tell you what they said.
“Despite those great strides, the foundation of who we are as Minnesota Republicans is being assaulted and manipulated by outside groups posing as Trump supporters and leaders.”
Those are pretty strong baseless allegations. MAGASOTA has not assaulted anyone nor has anyone been manipulated. MAGASOTA members are free to come and go as they please. Our members are “free thinkers”. Why is the mngop assaulting the intelligence of our members?
“These groups prey on low information activists that love our President- and manipulate those activists to get involved in efforts that cause harm to our President’s ability to win Minnesota”.
The GOP Party leadership believes that YOU are low information activists because you don’t tow the line for them.
Hillary Clinton called us Deplorables. Now our own Republican party is calling us “low information”. I think not.
No one is causing harm to the President. It’s the party that is causing harm to the President. They are dividing supporters -not MAGASOTA. Our state hasn’t won a Republican Presidential race since 1972.
This is on the party-not me and not you! Own up to your own failures MNGOP.
“These groups also actively work against Republicans in our state- which hurt our chances to hold the majority in the State Senate and win back the State House.”
More lies. We are endorsing one candidate and supporting one race. President Trump. If Trump doesn’t win we all lose!
“We have one goal in this state- to elect Republicans up and down the ballot. Any outside group or entity that tries to use our activists and leaders to work against our President and fellow Republicans will not be accepted by our party. We are standing strong with our Repuclicna partners at the RNC, Trump Victory, NRcc, NRSC, Minnesota House and MInnesota State Senate.”
Who is the party to lay claim on activists and volunteers? They do not own you. The arrogance of this statement is nauseating.
And finally the party is making it very clear that MAGASOTA or any other grassroots effort is REJECTED BY THEM!
“Turn out to caucus and don’t let the scammers take over our party and run us into the ground.”
Really? That is what they think about us? That we will participate in the political process, take over “our” party and run “us” into the ground. This is just unbelievable. This party does NOT want Trump supporters participating.
Finally my friend, MAGASOTA is a PAC. We by law cannot work in direct coordination with a campaign. We will be using our financial resources to support our effort to win Minnesota for President Trump. Our members have already been going door to door, making thousands of phone calls, participating in MAGASOTA meetups, sending thousands of email and more. Our efforts remain in Minnesota. Our calls stay in Minnesota.
President Trump has claimed Minnesota. WE are not going to disappoint him.
2020 is likely our last chance to elect a Republican President in this state. I do not believe in my life time there will be another opportunity. Communism has taken hold in [[URL REDACTED]]
Your support of MAGASOTA is needed now more than ever! Please show the MN GOP that we are the opposite of ‘low information activists’ by working with us!

Hi , it’s Tom Cotton, Senator for Arkansas. I’m reaching out today about Dr. Roger Marshall, our Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Kansas.
Dr. Marshall is a pro-life physician who’s delivered more than 5,000 babies. He’s a fellow veteran who’s tough on crime and will work to END our dependence on China.
Chuck Schumer and the radical left have made Dr. Marshall one of their TOP targets this year. In fact, liberal donors have flooded Kansas with $10 MILLION to prop up Dr. Marshall’s opponent — a pro-abortion, pro-amnesty, and pro-Green New Deal radical Democrat.
I need Dr. Marshall in the Senate to fight with me against Communist China and the liberal mob — and to PROTECT THE SUPREME COURT. And I’m personally asking YOU to help him WIN. Will you rush a donation to help Dr. Marshall’s team reach their End of Quarter goal RIGHT NOW?
RUSH DONATE $250
RUSH DONATE $100
RUSH DONATE $50
RUSH DONATE $15
RUSH DONATE OTHER AMOUNT
Democrats need FOUR seats to flip the Senate — and they’ve made Dr. Marshall and Kansas a TOP TARGET.
And if they win in Kansas, they’ll be one step closer to forcing their socialist agenda of PACKING the Supreme Court, defunding the police, mass amnesty, and the Green New Deal on the American people.
Dr. Marshall is fighting to take Kansas off Chuck Schumer’s map, but he needs our help. I’m personally asking YOU to join me in standing with Dr. Marshall for U.S. Senate.
Please, rush a donation of $15, $50, or even $100 RIGHT NOW.
We’re counting on your swift response.

13,"Our July 4th celebrations are taking on a very different meaning this year.
Democratic Party of Oregon Logo
Alex,
Our July 4th celebrations are taking on a very different meaning this year.
We're usually excited to share with you information about ways to celebrate with Democrats in your area, whether it's picnics, parades, fireworks, or other festivities.
But the COVID-19 pandemic has cancelled those gatherings, and we want to strongly urge you and your loved ones to keep your July 4th celebrations local, and small.
Governor Kate Brown's face covering requirement for public indoor spaces is now in place across all of Oregon, and it's critical that all of us look out for each other and do our part to help stop the spread of the virus.
July 4th also takes on a deeper meaning in light of the widespread protests for racial justice and against police brutality.
The last few weeks have seen hopeful signs of progress here in Oregon.
In last week's special session, the Oregon Legislature declared affirmatively that Black Lives Matter, and passed laws to reform police accountability. I want to thank the Oregon Legislature's BIPOC Caucus for their inspiring leadership in passing those measures, and look forward to working alongside them as we move to create a more just society here in Oregon.
But this is just the beginning of that work, and as many of us take time today to celebrate the founding of our nation, we must also take time to reckon with America's original sin — slavery — and the fact that we are still dealing with its consequences more than 150 years since its abolition.
Frederick Douglass in 1856, around 38 years of age
Frederick Douglass in 1856
Personally, it's an opportunity to revisit one of the most cutting assessments of our Independence Day, delivered by Frederick Douglass in 1852:
""Fellow-citizens, pardon me, allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here to-day? What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? ... I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought light and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn. ... Fellow-citizens, above your national, tumultuous joy, I hear the mournful wail of millions! whose chains, heavy and grievous yesterday, are, to-day, rendered more intolerable by the jubilee shouts that reach them.
[[URL REDACTED]], to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer; a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are, to Him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy-a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of the United States, at this very hour.""
Douglass, rightly so, doesn't mince any words. But he closes his speech looking forward, with a glimmer of hope:
""Allow me to say, in conclusion, notwithstanding the dark picture I have this day presented, of the state of the nation, I do not despair of this country. There are forces in operation which must inevitably work the downfall of slavery. ... I, therefore, leave off where I began, with hope. While drawing encouragement from ""the Declaration of Independence,"" the great principles it contains, and the genius of American Institutions, my spirit is also cheered by the obvious tendencies of the age. Nations do not now stand in the same relation to each other that they did ages ago. No nation can now shut itself up from the surrounding world and trot round in the same old path of its fathers without interference. The time was when such could be done. Long established customs of hurtful character could formerly fence themselves in, and do their evil work with social impunity. Knowledge was then confined and enjoyed by the privileged few, and the multitude walked on in mental darkness. But a change has now come over the affairs of mankind.""
You can read the full text of Douglass' address here.
From all of us at the Democratic Party of Oregon, please stay safe, stay local, and stay healthy this weekend.
Thank you,

14,"Alex,
My opponent just became the first candidate in our race to go negative.
In a TV ad that launched yesterday, appointed Representative Perrin Jones accuses me of talking about ""weakening our police departments."" His proof? That I support common-sense investments in police accountability through body cameras, de-escalation training, and a statewide independent oversight committee made up of members from both the law enforcement and civilian community. All of these proposals would actually improve trust between our police and communities, as well as give additional funding to our law enforcement agencies.
This was the first TV ad of my opponent's entire campaign. Instead of presenting a positive vision that stands on its own merits, he has chosen to try and scare voters by attacking me. My criminal justice platform actually calls for more resources, and in addition to those calls for accountability, I rolled out a number of policy goals in July to help broadly reform North Carolina’s criminal justice system. You can read those here.
We need to get the message out that this was a blatant scare tactic aimed at misleading the voters of Pitt County. Can you help us combat my opponents' false TV ad by donating today?
I'm no stranger to the importance of law enforcement. In fact, I worked for three years for the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of North Carolina where I helped support federal prosecutors combatting drug violence, gang activity, white collar crime, and other serious offenses. Here in Greenville, I'm a regular attendee of National Night Out, a community-building campaign that promotes police-community partnerships. Plus, I work with a number of law enforcement agencies through my current job in the private sector.
I'm trying to offer real solutions to some of the most serious issues facing all our people. Part of reforming North Carolina's criminal justice system means making sure local departments can maintain the trust of our communities through the highest level of integrity and accountability. Instead of running false ads, perhaps Perrin Jones should explain to voters why he is against that idea.
As always, thank you for your support.
Sincerely,
Brian Farkas

Fellow Conservative,
I’m sure you’re disgusted to witness the devastation of Democrat-run cities as crime and violence spike to record levels under the mob rule of Antifa and violent rioters.
And as Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and their far-Left party cheer-on mass rioting and looting across the country, I know you agree that the soul of America is at stake in 2020.
That’s why we’re emailing you to make an urgent request:
Will you donate $25, $50 or more so that we can continue stand with President Trump and fight the far-Left socialists in this pivotal election?
So, your generous donation today will also give a critical push in this crucial final month before the election.
In case you missed my speech at the Republican National Convention, I said,
> “…the Republican Party is the pro-America party, and President Donald J. Trump is the pro-America candidate.”
We’ve been defending President Trump from the never-ending onslaught of attacks, including:
* An insane, fake-news fueled Russia-collusion hoax,
* Robert Mueller’s taxpayer-funded “investigation”, and
* Adam Schiff and the Dem’s despicable impeachment sham!
We CANNOT allow these far-left radicals to win in November!
Will you join our fight to defend conservative values and the United States Constitution by making your best gift of $25, $50 or more?
If Republicans lose in November, conservatives like you and me won’t be able to stop the far-left from radically transforming America into a socialist nation with their radical plans to:
* Defund the police
* Defund Border Patrol
* Defund our Military!
Unlike Joe Biden and his far-Left pals, we are proud of America’s founding conservative principles that created the greatest, most prosperous nation in human history.
So, please join the fight for our cherished conservative values by supporting my re-election with the most generous contribution you can afford.
Thanks in advance for your support.
And may God bless you, and the United States of America!
In liberty,
Jim Jordan

If you weren't paying attention to the GOP Convention speaker list, here's one you need to know: Matt Gaetz.
Tonight, on a national stage, Gaetz will sing Trump's praises -- in spite of every crisis Trump created for us, every occasion he utterly failed to rise to, and every burden he put on the backs of the American people.
There's no telling what Gaetz will say exactly, but we'd wager it'll be divisive, tone-deaf, ignorant, self-promotional, and so boastful you'll want to throw your television straight into the garbage.
What Gaetz should be doing, instead of soaking up the limelight, is working with partners in the Senate to deliver relief for communities suffering from the coronavirus. He should be holding Trump accountable for his crimes. He should be apologizing for failing to serve our district with the honor and integrity we deserve.

Friend, Trump continues to abuse his power to an extent never before seen in American history:
* He refused to divest from his business interests.
* He pardoned his friends and campaign staffers for crimes they committed in his name.
* He was impeached for abusing the power of the presidency.
* He demanded that AG Bill Barr jail all of his political enemies.
* And that was before POLITICO reported that Trump “tramples government boundaries as election nears” with his use of federal resources to prop up his campaign.
These are not minor issues, they’re serious offenses that demand immediate consequences. Over a third of Americans still stand by Trump and his overreach of executive power – but with people casting their ballots right now, we need to know you’re not one of them.

Dear Conservative,
I’m Aliscia Andrews. I’m the US Marine and National Security expert running against Socialist Jennifer Wexton in Virginia’s 10th District!
Right now, we need YOUR help to stop the Socialist Left and Mike Bloomberg for buying this district for Jennifer Wexton. Again. Will you help with a donation today?
As we face a wave of crime, violence, and anarchy targeting cops, Democrats decided to INTENTIONALLY make them easier targets.
The Virginia State Senate, controlled by cop-hating Democrats, passed a bill that would make assaulting an officer a misdemeanor and drops the mandatory minimum of six months for assaulting an officer.
This is the Leftist America Democrats are trying to force down our throats!
They are handing this country to criminals—while intentionally trying to get our cops hurt.
We MUST stop this! That’s why I need your help!
Socialist Wexton is part of the Defund the Police effort nationally that would hurt our cops even more!
I need your help to meet my fundraising end of the month goal of $50,000 dollars! We need this money to compete against Wexton’s absentee ballot push!
We are running out of time!
Will you help us reach our goal with a donation of $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, $1,000, or more today?
*HELP US REACH OUR GOAL!*
I have and always will stand with our officers. I know what it feels like to serve in a uniform.
Socialist Wexton is part of the problem. She is standing with the same Leftists actively encouraging violence against our police!
This law the state Senate passed will only serve to encourage violence against our police!
We have to STOP this lawlessness and take our country back! To do that, we must protect the men and women who protect us!
Please send your best donation and help us beat Socialism and lawlessness in Virginia!
Thank you for your support and prayers!

Hi Alex,
A lot of important bills that we had been working on all year had to pass in a shorter timeframe than usual. One of these bills that I am particularly proud of is HB20-1409, a bill that Representative Adrienne Benavidez and I have been working on since last year to better serve our immigrant communities.
HB20-1409 brings privately-run, for-profit detention centers that house non-citizens in Colorado in line with state penal institution standards. These detention centers - like the ICE detention facility in Aurora run by the Florida company GEO Group - were not held to the same health and safety standards of other state-run institutions. This has been a problem for years with detained individuals reporting a lack of medical care, moldy and contaminated food, concerns about cleanliness and health, and lack of access to legal representation and contact with their families.
These facilities house people detained at the border, those waiting for decisions on claims for asylum, and noncitizens living in the U.S. who were arrested for crimes or administrative infractions. Many of the detainees have not been convicted - or even accused - of a crime, but rather of violating a civil administrative violation. It's clear that our immigration system is profoundly broken.
We have a lot more to do, but I am hopeful that HB20-1409 will put pressure on detention facilities like GEO to comply with basic health and safety standards. This could not be more critical.
All the best,
Why Is It Important?
In 2019, an ACLU investigation uncovered various cases of disturbing and unethical treatment of detained immigrants at Aurora's GEO facility, including; a heart attack death due to “incompetence,” a man whose leg was amputated after complaints of bedsores were ignored, a man whose injuries went untreated after he was attacked by other detainees, a man who was told by a psychiatrist that “no one cared about him and that he should sign voluntary deportation papers,” a “botched tooth extraction,” and a man who was denied access to hearing aids. They found that the center lacked critical medical staff and that one detainee died after not receiving mandatory health screenings and medication. There have also been reports of retaliation against detainees who have raised concerns, such as staff withholding food and recreation time. All of this occurred before COVID-19.
Photo courtesy of Cullen Lobe, The Colorado Independent
The current pandemic has only further exacerbated the need for state inspections of all facilities to ensure proper cleaning protocols, adequate medical care and accessible testing. In April, a federal judge found that ICE did not do enough to respond to coronavirus and “likely exhibited callous indifference to the safety and well-being” of people in its custody. This on top of the fact that detainees are having to wait much longer for a hearing and are often kept in isolation for days at a time. As of last week, the GEO facility in Aurora has confirmed 16 cases of COVID-19 and is still considered to have an “active” outbreak.
Testimonials
* Even before the pandemic, Abel worried about access to medical care and the often unsanitary conditions of the medical holding cell. At the beginning of the crisis, GEO was understaffed and his unit didn’t get access to clean towels for days at a time. He also didn’t get enough soap or disinfectants. When the facility finally started changing systems because of COVID, he was forced in his cell 23 hours a day, with so many people it was impossible to remain 6 feet apart. “My fear of COVID19 and the anxiety that comes with it are very real. I had a nightmare that I was sick, sweating, and unable to breathe or get the help I needed. I don’t want to die here at GEO in detention.”
\- Abel, detained at GEO for over a year
* Miguel Angel suffered a broken hand at the hands of a GEO guard in March 2019 that never received treatment, and he endured numerous quarantines after several outbreaks of mumps, measles, and chickenpox. Frustrated with the unlivable conditions, Miguel Angel became an outspoken advocate from inside of the GEO immigrant detention center for over a year, organizing a hunger strike and prompting a congressional probe into the detention conditions at the GEO facility, as well as a federal lawsuit against ICE and GEO Group. Miguel Angel made the difficult decision that his health could no longer bear the cruel and unfair treatment of GEO detention, and accepted voluntary departure to Mexico, even though he hasn’t been there since he was 13 years old.
\- Miguel Angel, detained for over two years, self deported
* ""I worry about my husband getting sick with COVID-19 in detention. As a health care worker, I know they are not doing everything they need to to keep everyone in there safe. He has to share a cell with 5 other people for most of the day, so it's impossible for them to follow social distancing. The past month, he was in his cell for 23 hours a day. There were some days that he was left in his cell for days at a time.
\- Claudia Robles, wife of detained immigrant and Medical Assistant
HB20-1409: What Does It Do?
With the passage of HB20-1409, Colorado will bring facilities housing non-citizens on civil immigration cases under the same standards as other facilities in the state. The bill requires the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to inspect these facilities and report their findings to the legislature. It also allows the state to perform unannounced inspections and for family members to lodge complaints about conditions within the facility. This bill passed with bipartisan support in both chambers.

Business Insider explains it best: (we’ve included the most important parts)
Business Insider: Trump reportedly rejected approving a bailout package that would rescue the US Postal Service, and it could be a disaster for states trying to expand voting by mail
The United States has plunged the US Postal Service into dire financial straits, as more Americans than ever rely on post offices to deliver necessary medicine and supplies, especially in underserved rural areas.
House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Gerry Conolly, who runs the subcommittee that oversees the Postal Service, sounded the alarm that the agency could run out of funding altogether by June if Congress doesn't act soon.
""Based on a number of briefings and warnings this week about a critical fall-off in mail across the country, it has become clear that the Postal Service will not survive the summer without immediate help from Congress and the White House,"" the two said in a March 23 joint statement, calling on Congress to appropriate $25 million in emergency funds to the agency.

As states have steadily expanded absentee and mail-in voting over the past two decades, the proportion of Americans voting in-person on election day has declined from 90% in 1992 to 60% in 2016, according to the US Census Bureau.
But some Republicans have openly protested expanding vote by mail options because they believe it would hurt them politically. Trump said in a recent ""Fox & Friends"" appearance that the House's stimulus provisions had ""levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.""
Since then, Trump has continued to spread misinformation about the safety and security of voting by mail on his Twitter account, falsely claiming that it ""substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD,"" which none of the available evidence on vote by mail supports.

And their role in delivering millions of mail-in ballots this November will prove to be critical to the 2020 Election.

Business Insider explains it best: (we’ve included the most important parts)
Business Insider: Trump Reportedly Rejected Approving a Bailout Package that would Rescue the US Postal Service, and It Could Be a Disaster for States Trying to Expand Voting by Mail
The United States has plunged the US Postal Service into dire financial straits, as more Americans than ever rely on post offices to deliver necessary medicine and supplies, especially in underserved rural areas.
House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Gerry Conolly, who runs the subcommittee that oversees the Postal Service, sounded the alarm that the agency could run out of funding altogether by June if Congress doesn’t act soon.
'Based on a number of briefings and warnings this week about a critical fall-off in mail across the country, it has become clear that the Postal Service will not survive the summer without immediate help from Congress and the White House,' the two said in a March 23 joint statement, calling on Congress to appropriate $25 million in emergency funds to the agency.

As states have steadily expanded absentee and mail-in voting over the past two decades, the proportion of Americans voting in-person on election day has declined from 90% in 1992 to 60% in 2016, according to the US Census Bureau.
But some Republicans have openly protested expanding vote by mail options because they believe it would hurt them politically.  Trump said in a recent 'Fox & Friends' appearance that the House's stimulus provisions had 'levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.'
Since then, Trump has continued to spread misinformation about the safety and security of voting by mail on his Twitter account, falsely claiming that it 'substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD,' which none of the available evidence on vote by mail supports.

81,"We should be voting out and defunding politicians like Ellen Jaffee who created this mess in the first place.
Hello Alex,
The recent rise in crime in New York City is a direct result of the disastrous policies being implemented by state and local officials.
Non-enforcement of “petty” crimes.
Cashless bail for “non-violent” criminals.
Parole for unrepentant cop killers and child sex offenders.
Is it any wonder why New York is becoming less safe?
And yet, Bill de Blasio and the City Council are talking about defunding the NYPD to the tune of $1 BILLION!
DEFUNDING THE POLICE? GET REAL!
Chip in now to help STOP these disastrous policies!
WATCH MY VIDEO ON THE ""DEFUND THE POLICE"" MOVEMENT
For too long, Albany and New York City politicians have covered up their failed policies on education, housing, poverty, drug addiction, and mental health by passing on those responsibilities to law enforcement – and then throwing police officers under the bus at the first sign of controversy.
We need real reform if we want to address the root problems of inequality and injustice.
We need good paying jobs for all New Yorkers; a quality education for every child; access to affordable health care; and safe neighborhoods to live in.
Rather than defund the police, we should be voting out and defunding politicians, like my opponent Ellen Jaffee, who helped create this mess in the first place.
CHIP IN $25
CHIP IN $50
CHIP IN $100
CHIP IN $500
CHIP IN $1,000
Together, let's send a message to the politicians in Albany and New York City that defunding the police is not just bad policy, it's downright dangerous!
Stay safe!

Patriot,
With all their guns aimed at Tucker Carlson, you’d think the radical Left would have their hands full.
But no…
They’ve now turned their guns ALSO on Sean Hannity in hopes they can kill two birds with one socialist stone.
Ever since Donald Trump won on election night in 2016, Barack Obama’s political network has been in socialist revolution mode.
And Hannity has called them out on it!
That’s why they hate him so much…he’s exposing their lies, corruption and Deep State collusion against President Trump.
We're rallying the Tea Party troops to launch our counter-revolution against the radical Left to circle the wagons for Hannity...
…because they just ESCALATED their plan to take him out, too.
##  SIGN THE PETITION:
DEFEND HANNITY!
Just this week Hannity called out the radical leftist Democrats for their failed leadership:
> ""We have Pelosi. We have Schumer. We have Biden. 125 years of swamp failure. They have done nothing to quell inner-city violent crime anywhere in America, nothing to fix the broken dilapidated disgusting and repulsive educational system. They have failed America's children. We have far left mayors. They have ruled these cities for decades. They have completely failed their citizens.""
They HATE Hannity for exposing the truth!
So in order to shut him up, they’ve launched a scandalous — completely bogus — lawsuit against both Hannity and Tucker...
…they recruited a disgruntled former employee to make scurrilous claims of harassment at Fox News…which “have no basis in fact whatsoever.""
But the truth has never gotten in the way of the radical Left’s plan to entirely destroy conservative patriots and remove them from the airways!
The problem is, if we don’t step up and defend Hannity alongside our defense of Tucker, it’s only a matter of time before they prevail!
If you think this is just fear-mongering, think again. This is EXACTLY how they took down Bill O’Reilly!
With O’Reilly’s head on a proverbial pike, they’re foaming at the mouth to lop off Hannity’s head, too.
If we lose Hannity’s critical voice, cutting through lies and deception from the Left, President Trump’s ability to counteract the fake news media will be severely muted ahead of November.
That's why I need you to sign Hannity's petition right now and join the counter-revolution to keep him on the air. Will you sign?

CEO, [[URL REDACTED]]

Claudia for Congress
Friend,
Americans in big cities across the country are suffering under the weight of rising crime right now, and it’s easy to see why.
Democrat mayors in charge of Seattle, Chicago, and New York – just to name a few – have abandoned their police officers and let lawlessness, looting, and violence take over their cities.
Now, Anthony Brindisi is working with Nancy Pelosi to let lawlessness take over our own district by voting to defund the police and voting to release dangerous prisoners early.
Not on my watch.
This is just the tip of the iceberg of failed Democrat leadership – and it’s only going to get worse if Brindisi, Biden, and Pelosi win on November 3rd and take over Washington.
That’s why I need to know where you stand.
Friend, the rising crime that we’re seeing across the country right now could have all been avoided – but Democrats chose to sit on the sidelines and do nothing to stop it.
America can’t prosper without a strong rule of law and strong police departments to keep us safe, and that’s why I’m running to strengthen law & order starting right here in NY-22.
With just 77 days to go until we cast our votes, I need to know that you’re with me on this issue.
What will you choose on November 3rd?

84,"Watching the Democratic National Convention has given me hope. It has reminded me that we can dream of a world, a nation, that is brought together by leadership.
Hi Alex,
If you’re like me, this summer has had its ups and downs. Judging by the posts on social media, many of you feel like you’ve had your fair share of difficulties: a pandemic, rising unemployment, increased crime, outrage over the deaths of George Floyd and Breona Taylor, and so many more. And now, fires - not just one, but four - raging through our state. I saw someone’s post the other day: “Can’t we just say that 2020 is another four letter word… like what the 2020 are you talking about; shut the 2020 up…” I get it.
But watching the Democratic National Convention has given me hope. It has reminded me that we can dream of a world, a nation, that is brought together by leadership. Presidential nominee Joe Biden challenged us to see this moment for what it is: “a moment that calls for hope and light and love. Hope for our futures, light to see our way forward, and love for one another.""
So let’s pick up where we left off. Let’s do something positive for our neighbors and our community. I find with so much change, it’s only possible to set short-term goals. So here are a few of mine:
1. Register 10 people by the end of the month who were not already registered.
2. Choose 5 businesses affected by the recent forest fires and make a small donation.
3. Find an afternoon to spend with my wife and kiddos, disconnected from our phones, the news, and focused on each other.
4. Teach my son to ride a bike without training wheels.
5. Take the kids fishing.
What are your goals? How are you finding time to stay balanced? We have to be there to support each other. And with that, I leave you with the much more inspiring words of Senator Kamala Harris:
""Years from now, when this moment has passed, our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and ask us: ‘Where were you when the stakes were so high?’ And we will tell them, not just how we felt—we will tell them what we did.""
I hope to tell my kids that I fought hard to represent House District 2, that I did my part to mobilize voters in the most historic election of my life so far, and that I brought back a bit of love to our lives and our community.
All the best,

#  Real Justice
Add your name to our petition: Demand that Governor Cuomo remove all cash bail demands from his budget during a public health crisis.
Alex,
A few weeks ago we told you about Angel Garcia, a New Yorker who spent 15 days in jail at Rikers Island because his family could not afford his $20,000 bail. His crime was stealing bikes to put food on the table for his family.
Angel’s story is like that of so many New Yorkers who are desperate to raise themselves and their families out of poverty. And now, in the midst of a public health crisis, Governor Andrew Cuomo wants to roll back bail reform measures recently passed in New York to start jailing more people again.
We cannot stand by as the Governor attempts to criminalize poverty during a pandemic. Tell Governor Cuomo to remove all cash bail demands from his budget.
Take Action
If Angel were in jail right now, he would be forced into close quarters with hundreds of other inmates who have the potential to carry and spread the COVID-19 virus. Currently, 84 people have tested positive for COVID-19 at Rikers.
As the CDC and other world health organizations tell us we need to social distance, Andrew Cuomo is trying to punish poor people by forcing them into confined jail cells.
Sign our petition demanding that Governor Cuomo ensure the safety and well-being of all New Yorkers and stop jailing people for non-violent and misdemeanor offenses.
During this time of crisis, our government leaders should not be trying to take advantage of the poor.
Sign the petition
Thank you for taking action.

Madeleine Dean for Congress
Dear Friend,
Reform and action are necessary from our leaders at every level, and with our collective mourning must come swift action.
That’s why I am standing with Representative Jeffries to support the Eric Garner Effective Use of Force Prevention Act—a bill that bans chokeholds and pressure to the neck by police.
And just this week, I joined my colleagues as an original cosponsor to The Justice in Policing Act of 2020, which will:
* Hold police accountable in our courts
* Improve transparency into policing by collecting better and more accurate data of police misconduct
* Improve police training and practices
* Make lynching a federal crime
Yes, this is long overdue—and it continues to not be enough—but we must take the immediate steps we can with the promise of continued action.
Stand with me by adding your name.
History will repeat itself unless we make a change
Something I cannot get past: If these bills had been passed, we could have immediately held the police responsible accountable for the death of George Floyd.
And for 5 years we have not learned from the death of Eric Garner. But for so much longer we have not listened to Black Americans when they have demanded change.
No longer.
In solidarity,
Madeleine Dean

Today is Juneteenth. President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation to declare an end to the vile institution of slavery in America in 1862. But, many enslaved people were still held captive even after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed.
On June 19, 1865, the word of freedom finally reached a community of enslaved people in Galveston, Texas. It was on that day that Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, arrived in Galveston to declare freedom for the people who were still enslaved. It had taken nearly two and a half years for this news to travel to the hundreds of thousands of enslaved people still remaining in Texas.
The celebration of rejoice and reunion that followed is one we continue to this day.
On this Juneteenth, I am taking time to remember our history, to rejoice in the progress we have made and reflect on the enormity of the work we have left to do.
The truth is that even once Black Americans were emancipated, our ancestors continued to face enormous barriers: to live free from racism and racialized violence, to work with dignity, to vote, to build wealth and economic security for themselves and for future generations.
Today, as those barriers remain, so must our commitment to justice.
That is why I am working to push Congress to act to take the transformative steps needed to address the hate and systemic racism that is still so deeply rooted in our laws and institutions. We must finally make lynching a federal crime, reform our criminal justice system, and critically, intervene to create more transparent and accountable police departments.
The injustices we must confront are interrelated: from environmental injustice that disproportionately affects Black Americans to disparities in health access and outcomes to the staggering racial wealth gap that disadvantages Black families. We have so much work to do.
Today, as I honor the sacrifices made by my ancestors and rejoice in their grace and relentless hope for this country, I renew my commitment to fighting for true justice and equality for all.
I hope you will join me.

Take Back NY-13
New York City is ground zero for the leftist assault on America. I decided to run for Congress because I can’t stand watching the destruction of my beloved home.
One of the hardest things for me to watch has been the apathetic response to the decline of New York. This used to be one of the cleanest, safest, big cities in the world, but voters ""have become"", as the song goes, ""comfortably numb.""
Help Us Finish the Quarter Strong
But it’s not too late. We are ending the quarter and have 5 weeks until the election. Help us meet our financial goals. Radical representatives like my opponent Adriano Espaillat are counting on you to not show up, or support my campaign. Like other Democrats, Espaillat is on board for the woke agenda. He brags about being the first undocumented immigrant in Congress, if that tells you anything.
This is the epitome of leftwing hubris. The modern Democratic Party has contempt for you and the country. Shove it back in their smug faces and support my campaign.
Sincerely,

Friend,
I am used to getting attacked by the mainstream media and the Left. But this is something new.
I've been running ads in swing states to make sure voters know that a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for chaos, crime, and open borders. Joe Biden has turned his campaign platform over to Bernie Sanders and Joe would rather hide out in his basement than face the voters.
And my work is getting noticed.

Trump escaped impeachment simply because the GOP saved his hide.
But in the impeachment trial, we saw hard evidence that Trump obstructed justice.
So Kamala Harris, speaking as a former prosecutor, is simply trying to uphold the law. Trump is not above the law and he must be held accountable.
But charging an ex-President (even one as CORRUPT and CRIMINAL as Trump) is controversial, so we need to gauge support among informed Democrats.

Dear Patriot,
Our Country is at a crossroads right now…
As the Coronavirus spreads from country to country and has even spread in pockets to our shores, we are reminded of how vitally important our borders are… and how insecure they are currently.
Our nation is being invaded by illegal aliens, pouring across our unsecure Southern border. Thousands of drug smugglers and human traffickers hide amongst them, bringing in violent crime.
In the wake of a pandemic, we need action NOW!
Please donate to my campaign and send a true conservative to Washington who will stand with the President and Build the Wall!
As a Homeland Security Policy Strategist, my job is to help keep our country safe. Every day, I have to deal with the consequences of an unsecure border, from a coronavirus outbreak to a gang shooting in our neighborhoods.
Waves of people pouring across our border in caravans, unvetted and illegally, is a huge national security risk! And Democrats like Jennifer Wexton will not do anything. In fact, they WANT open borders. Socialists like George Soros are even funding some of the caravans.
Why? Because they hope one day to grant illegal aliens total amnesty and create a new wave of democrat voters. And they don’t care how many Americans get hurt in the process.
These open-borders, pro-illegal Democrats like Wexton even go as far as to attack our existing border security infrastructure. Democrats have even said they want to abolish ICE! I need your help to stop them!
Its time to stand with the President, Build the Wall, and secure our Southern Border once and for all!
Please donate $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, or more to my campaign today and help me fight with the President!
The Illegal-First agenda needs to be stopped now! Our Country is so vulnerable to global pandemics like Coronavirus and smuggling without a secure border.
The Wall is just the start…
If elected, I will get border security and ICE the tools it needs to verify very single person who tries to step foot on American soil.
Socialist, illegal-first Democrats like Jennifer Wexton need to be sent packing and replaced by Conservatives who will stand with our President!
Please donate your most generous gift today and we can take back this District!

Subject: Join me in supporting Jon Ossoff for Senate
Friend,
On November 3, we are going to close the door on Donald Trump's presidency. Then, we can expand our potential to make real progress on the issues that make a difference in people's lives.
But to achieve that potential, we need my friend Jon Ossoff in the United States Senate. Here's why:
It's time to elect a new generation of leaders. And Jon Ossoff's achievements as an investigative journalist -- leading a team that's exposed war crimes, enslavement, murder, and bribery all over the planet -- speak to his courage, his values, and his toughness.
Jon and his supporters have made this one of the country's most competitive races during a time when dozens of states are coming into play. So today I'm asking you to dig deep and invest in Jon's victory. Will you donate right now to help Jon Ossoff win in Georgia and flip the Senate?

Senate Republicans have used the past four years to give tax breaks to the wealthy, scheme how to take health care away from millions, and confirm scores of unqualified or extreme judicial and executive nominees.
The solution to removing the GOP stranglehold on the Senate lies in no small part with Jon Ossoff in Georgia. Jon is surging in the polls as more and more voters learn about his history fighting corruption.
But here's what's even more important: Jon is someone Georgians can rely on. He is focused on ensuring every American has affordable health care and rebuilding the economy so working families and small businesses thrive, and he's committed to passing a new Voting Rights Act and a new Civil Rights Act.
When I look at Georgia, I see what Virginia looked like just a few years ago. Democrats are making huge inroads, and if we can all do our part to invest and help good, smart leaders like Jon reach the finish line, we can flip Georgia.
Jon is neck-and-neck in the polls with his pro-Trump opponent who has repeatedly voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But the GOP knows control of the Senate comes down to Georgia, so they are spending big to keep their power. Mitch McConnell's allies and super PACs have already committed over $25 million to stop Jon.
Jon isn't taking contributions from corporate PACs or federal lobbyists. That means he's relying on a small-dollar grassroots campaign to power him to victory.
We can't flip the Senate without you, friend. Can you chip in $15 to elect Jon Ossoff in Georgia and help chart a new course for this country?

Alex,
It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
For the sake of American strength, jobs, law and order, our lives, and our liberties, we must defeat this radical duo on Election Day. The stakes have never been higher, Alex, and we need your help to send a message that this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS.
