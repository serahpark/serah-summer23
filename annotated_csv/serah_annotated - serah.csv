25,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
NPR: “Top congressional Democrats are calling for a federal investigation after a nurse who worked at an immigration detention center in Georgia filed a whistleblower complaint alleging a lack of medical care and unsafe work practices that facilitated the spread of COVID-19. She also says that immigrant women received questionable hysterectomies.”
ICE has a history of committing human rights abuses while emboldened under the Trump administration \-- first separating families at the border, then leaving migrant children in cages, and now, allegations have surfaced that a doctor in an ICE detention center performed mass hysterectomies on unknowing migrant women without their consent.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is demanding an investigative briefing on these alleged crimes by the end of the week \-- stating: “this profoundly disturbing situation recalls some of the darkest moments of our nation’s history.” But ICE officials are denying any fault.
Since Trump’s election, we’ve seen a rise in xenophobia and hate crimes targeting immigrants and communities of color. Despite mounting evidence of abuse taking place in detention centers across the country, Trump has praised ICE as “compassionate” and said if centers are too crowded, “tell them not to come to the USA.” Another four years of Trump’s inhumane leadership will completely erase the values this country was founded on, but nearly 50% of Americans approve of Trump’s immigration policy. Today we need to know, do you?
Do you condemn ICE's human rights abuses?
YES NO
Your input is critical, so thank you for your participation,

Our Chairman Nick Langworthy is in Charlotte and just cast New York's 94 delegate votes UNANIMOUSLY for President Donald J. Trump!
Chairman Langworthy Casts All of New York's Votes for President Trump!
But he didn't stop there--he also used his time at the microphone to SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT on President Trump's incredible leadership for New York throughout coronavirus. Despite the lies told during Democrats' fictional convention last week, Chairman Langworthy reminded America that President Trump gave New York everything it asked for. Even dishonest Governor Cuomo thanked President Trump for his tremendous support.
From sending the U.S.S. Comfort, to providing PPE and thousands of ventilators to lifting up New Yorkers and small businesses with financial aid, President Trump delivered for the state of New York.
But it's New York's leadership that has created turmoil. Our worst-in-the-nation business climate, multi-billion dollar budget deficit and crime-riddled [[URL REDACTED]] failed New York agenda will be the failed national agenda under the Biden-Harris ticket.
That is why the New York GOP is fighting to give President Trump FOUR MORE YEARS! Will you stand up with us and FIGHT?
FIGHT WITH US TO RE-ELECT PRESIDENT TRUMP
We are 70 days away from Election Day and President Trump Needs us to have a strong NYGOP in fighting shape. Help us beat back the Democrats' lies and fake news!

JUSTICE FOR BREONNA TAYLOR: DEMAND THE INVADING OFFICERS ARE CHARGED WITH MURDER ➞
We need you to remember this name: Breonna Taylor.
Breonna Taylor was an award-winning EMT and First Responder from Louisville, KY who risked her own health and safety to serve her community during Covid-19. Her life mattered.
Breonna Taylor
But Breonna was murdered by the Louisville Police Department at her home while sleeping. They barged in without identifying themselves to look for drugs that were never found and for a person who did not even reside in Breonna’s residence.
Breonna’s life was stolen. But the three police officers who invaded her home are STILL gainfully employed and have yet to be arrested and charged with murder.
The only person who was charged was Breonna’s boyfriend, who shot at the door in self-defense when the officers refused to identify themselves.
We’re beyond disgusted at this horrific disregard for Black life. So we’re calling for justice.
We won’t rest until these offenders are held accountable for their crime. Sign on to demand the invading officers are charged with the murder of Breonna Taylor →
JUSTICE FOR BREONNA TAYLOR: DEMAND THE INVADING OFFICERS ARE CHARGED WITH MURDER ➞
Black Americans, especially Black essential workers like Breonna, deserve the right to sleep peacefully in their own home, free from harm.
This is an injustice that cannot be ignored. And it will take an army of grassroots activists like you, to finally be taken seriously by Kentucky State Officials.

29,"Legislation to protect children who survive botched abortions failed in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, including ""no"" votes from Sens. Peters and Stabenow.
PETERS, STABENOW FILIBUSTER BORN ALIVE BABIES
On Tuesday, February 25, the U.S. Senate failed to advance two prolife pieces of legislation. Though both bills received majority support, the pro-abortion minority in the U.S. Senate had enough votes to filibuster the bills.
The first bill, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, based on evidence that children at that point in pregnancy can feel pain from the gruesome abortion methods designed to take their lives. The vote was 53 to 44, failing to get the three-fifths vote required to ""end debate.""
The second bill, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, would add specific protections in law for children who survive botched abortions. The vote was 56 to 41, just short of the three-fifths needed.
Both of our U.S. Senators from Michigan, Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow, voted to filibuster these bills. While filibustering has grown in popularity in recent years, it's still generally used for only controversial bills.
What's so controversial about providing medical care to newborns? The original Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 received unanimous consent in the U.S. Senate; they didn't even have to hold a vote. Today, many elected officials are so in thrall to Planned Parenthood that they fail to condemn what amounts to an after-birth abortion, leaving children who survive botched abortions to die because they weren't ""wanted.""
Even despite recent evidence and growing support from some for infanticide and medical neglect of newborns who survive botched abortions, Sens. Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow were unmoved. They believe protecting newborns is so controversial that legislation mandating equal treatment for them must not even be allowed to be voted on.
Full story
MARCH 10 PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY
Just a quick reminder that time is running out if you want to request an absentee ballot for the March 10 presidential primary in Michigan. Remember, Michigan election law changes mean you can request an absentee ballot for any reason, or even go to your local clerk's office and cast an ""early vote"" by filling out a ballot there.
RIGHT TO LIFE RESOURCES: INFANTICIDE
Though thankfully most people still agree infanticide is wrong, infanticide has always been with us and will always be with us in some form. Because of that, opposing infanticide is part of Right to Life of Michigan's mission statement.
Historically and today, the greatest concern with infanticide is withholding medical care from disabled babies. We have a page on our website devoted to this major issue we address. If you haven't heard of Baby Doe, or Kermit Gosnell, or Michigan's Safe Delivery Law, you should give it a look.
Infanticide page
FILIBUSTERING ABORTION
While Senators Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow voted to hold the debate open on those two prolife bills indefinitely, that's just a tactic to take advantage of U.S. Senate rules. In truth, they don't want abortion to be discussed or debated. Pro-abortion elected officials want to keep abortion in the dark, completely unrestricted, far from the eyes of health department officials. When stories like the Kermit Gosnell case come to light, instead of being outraged by thousands of infanticides allowed to occur under the noses of state health inspectors, they insist it's just a ""local crime story"" to be swept under the rug.
Our job is to constantly keep abortion in the public spotlight, because we know that such a great injustice only works if we can pretend the unborn child doesn't exist. We're going to keep ""filibustering"" abortion no matter what the laws say, the media reports, or judges approve, for as long as it takes.

30,"Hi Alex,
First, I want to remind you that Our 15th Year Anniversary Virtual Celebration is still ongoing, and the need for your financial support is stronger than ever. Please help us start the next fifteen years with a firm foundation by making your donation today.
### Donate Here for our 15th Anniversary!
> > We hope you enjoyed Independence Day safely and with family and friends. While there is still a lot of Summer left, there is much work to do to prepare us for the upcoming battle in the Fall. And there are issues that must be fought for outside of the election. In this week's Newsletter we'll cover some of them.
### Sign Up for Our Volunteer Army!
Our top priority this Summer – and until November – is to reach out to our neighbors in often neglected areas of NW Philly and have good conversations with them about the importance of winning back the White House – to put an end to this corrupt administration – and do it so soundly that it sends a message to his enablers that the crime spree is over.
What will it take? It will require us to redouble our efforts from past campaigns. We must work together as a well-coordinated Volunteer Army to make calls (and knock doors where we can) to talk with the folks who stayed home in 2016, and to follow up with them to make sure they apply for a mail-in ballot (or commit to vote safely on Election Day).
The work we do this year will not be easy, but it is critical if we want to remain a democracy. If we commit to work together, if we call upon our friends to join us in this endeavor, we will deliver Pennsylvania on November 3rd. We will also have laid the foundation for the work that needs to be done in the coming year in those neighborhoods that have been long ignored.
Our work starts in August. Are you ready to step up?

### Voter Registration Opportunities
We are gearing up to phone bank and canvass (where appropriate) in NW Philly starting in a few weeks. Meanwhile, we still need to get folks registered to vote. If you'd like to help with this effort, you can do it here:
Ongoing –Tabling to Register Voters: If you are willing to spend some time tabling in high-traffic areas to register new voters, please email [[URL REDACTED]]
July 17th – Youth Voter Registration Party, 4-6PM: There will be music and snacks as we ask our younger neighbors to get involved in the governing of our nation by registering to vote, and then applying to vote by mail. We'll also be shooting some Tik Tok videos to share. The street party takes place near Temple University at 1428 Cecil B. Moore Ave.
### Open Forum on Philly Climate Issues: July 29th at 7PM
You are invited to join the Neighborhood Networks Environmental Committee and NW Philly Climate Action Network (NW Philly CAN) on Wednesday, July 29, 7 pm, for an on-line gathering highlighting the latest news about key climate-related issues and projects in Philadelphia. Speakers will include Meenal Raval on PECO and PGW’s recent hearings on rate hikes, Lynn Robinson on the SEPTA Nicetown Gas Plant, a combined heat/power plant, and Philly Thrive on Hilco’s conversion of the PES site.

Those filthy rotten liberals.
I don’t know about you, but they make me so angry I could spit fire.
Nothing but a bunch of lying, conniving, sneaky socialist pigs.
Look, I’ve always been brutally honest with you and now I must share something with you I’ve been dreading...
It kills me to do so.
It’s bad but I must let you know, or I’d never forgive myself so here goes:
I’m scared to death we’re starting to lose the battle...
It feels as if Trump’s reelection is slipping through our fingers.
We CAN’T let that happen.
You do want 4 more years of Trump, right?
If so, please sign our Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP.
President Trump needs to know how many Patriots he can count on.
In fact...
We’re finalizing the list of Patriots who already completed the Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP on Election Day—and we need to know you’re with us.
Make absolutely sure you’re on the list and not left out.
Can you imagine what our country will turn into Trump is not elected and the radical left takes over?
If you thought Obama was bad you ain’t seen nothing yet.
We’ve got to fight harder, scream louder, round up every Trump supporter we know...
Every undecided sitting on the fence...
And RISE UP.
I’m worried sick. I can’t sleep at night and I can’t eat.
My stomach is in knots—and I know I’m not alone.
Even Ted Cruz is running scared right now.
He came right out and said it...
“I'm worried about the election. I think it's really volatile. I think it could go either way. [[URL REDACTED]] president could win by a big margin and we could win both houses of Congress, [[URL REDACTED]] could be devastating.”
Let’s face it. Trump had a setback with Covid-19.
No question it’s putting him behind with his campaigning.
What’s worse...
Do you know what the Democrats are up to now while no one is looking?
Secretly funneling $170 million in government grants to radical left-wing extremist groups to carry out their dirty work
The group funding them—the Tides Center—has been flying under the radar for years...
Constantly creating new activist groups—that’s their sole mission.
These radical activist groups are the ones burning our country down.
If this doesn’t make you steamed, I don’t know what will because...
They’re using YOUR tax dollars!!!!
And they’re using them to fund radical extremist groups like Marxist Black Lives Matter Global Network...
Not to mention the Tides Center is an incubator for gun control and abortion rights.
They’re like this giant secretive dark money pit that Democrat donors throw massive amounts of money into.
Just to give you a little taste...
Millions have come from the insidious likes of George Soros's Open Society Foundations.
Need I say more? This is as bad as I’ve ever seen it.
Not only are they using extremist groups now but...
IF Trump loses these radicals are going to overrun the country...
They’re going to be crawling all over the White House, Oval Office and seats of Congress like cockroaches.
America will be lost forever.
Is that what you want?
I sure as hell don’t.
Look my friend, the liberals and their “super snowflakes” have mega money to burn and...
They’re throwing it at the feet of any radical that will take up their cause: defeat Trump and turn America into a globalist cabal.
Senator Cruz said it best...
""There are a lot of Democrats trying to steal the election...” “The left is showing up. They're pissed off. They hate Trump. We've got to make sure everyone else shows up.”
We need you to show up NOW — not tomorrow or the next day or only on November 3 at the voting booth.
Time is running out fast.
Now I know sometimes people wonder, well what can I do besides vote?
A LOT! This election is riding on YOU, a true Patriot.
If you want 4 more years of Trump here’s what you can do:
I need you to sign the Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP right now.
We’ve got to rally everyone to make this happen—to keep Trump in the Oval Office for another 4 years.
Imagine the horrors if he doesn’t get reelected...
Liberals will undermine the Constitution and  PACK  the Supreme Court...
They’re going to come running for your guns and ammo...
Then they’ll obliterate the Second Amendment...
Free speech will be shackled and chained...
Religious freedom will be abolished.
Remember how they removed God from our monuments, schools and military already under Obama?That was phase 1.
No doubt phase 2 will be the complete eradication of God.
Bibles will be [[URL REDACTED]] of worship will be taxed, putting them out of business...probably boarded up.
That cross around your neck? It’ll become a crime to wear it.
I’m not kidding. This is the liberal horror show—their vision if the Democrats get elected.
There is SO much at stake we can’t sit by and let the liberal loons take control of our beloved country.
It’s up to us.
Please do these 2 things right now:
1\. The Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP—sign here.
2\. Make a donation to keep us fighting and help put Trump firmly back in the lead so we have a runaway election. Click here.
Look, I’m asking you to do this because I’m worried. I didn’t see your name on the Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP.

Yes, we know the media and pollsters lie but...
You and I can’t take it for granted that Trump is ahead either.
He’s lost ground the past week being quarantined and not on the campaign trail.
We must keep fighting this brutal battle until Trump is officially declared a winner.
There are less than 25 days until election day.
Ask yourself one question:
Are you a TRUE Patriot? If your answer is YES...
Sign the Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP right now.
Then give a donation to help us get out there on the frontlines fighting this battle to the end.
$35, $50, $75, $150 or whatever you can give is great.
It’s a lot to ask in times like these, I know.
But I also know we will all be in financial ruins if Biden wins.
Jobs will be lost...
The market will crash...
Economic recovery will never happen in our lifetime.
Every donation you give of any amount counts towards helping Trump, the underdog, WIN this election.
Your donation puts our army of Trump supporters on the phone...
...relentlessly blasting our messages across social media...
... churning out faxes and emails...
...putting boots on the ground in DC and across the country...
... organizing rallies, marches and boat parades...
Please think of what America will look like under Biden and his corrupt DemoCRAP cronies.
It’s terrifying.
How badly do you want 4 more years or Trump leading America?
Will your name be on the list of Trump’s TOP supporters going to Republican leaders tomorrow?
Pledge to VOTE TRUMP on November 3rd now.
Then give a donation from the heart—one that says “I Stand With Trump! God Bless America!”
Before you do anything else, ask yourself:
How badly do you want Trump to win?

In case you missed it, Trump threatened to target and destroy Iran's cultural sites -- a legitimate war crime \-- and continues to say that if Iran retaliates, the U.S. will strike back ""quickly"" and in ""perhaps a disproportionate manner.""
Trump is dangerous and making military threats through Twitter, edging us closer and closer to war. We can't let it happen.
Add your name right now to DFA's petition calling on Congress to act NOW to stop war with Iran >>
Add your name
Alex, this is important.
Last night, news broke that the United States launched an airstrike in Iraq that killed a top military general of Iran.
It was an incredibly reckless, dangerous escalation in tensions between the U.S. and Iran, and many fear it means we’re on the brink of another endless, deadly war – this time with Iran.
There’s no time to waste: we the people need to stand up and demand Congress do their Constitutional duty by voting to stop a war with Iran ASAP. Add your name to our joint petition with Win Without War to make your voice heard now >>
ADD YOUR NAME
As Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren both pointed out, Donald Trump once criticized the Iraq war and even made promises to stop endless wars like it, but the truth is, yesterday’s military aggression towards Iran was no accident.
Since day one of his presidency, Trump has pushed our country towards a war with Iran. He filled his cabinet with warmongers like Mike Pompeo, pulled out of the historic and successful Iran nuclear deal, embarked on a “maximum pressure” campaign that sent thousands more U.S. troops to the Middle East, imposed crippling economic sanctions on Iran, and now, he oversaw the assassination of a senior Iranian military commander.
We’re now on the path to another potential World War III, and countless lives are at stake.
If you thought the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were bad, experts say a war with Iran would be even worse.
The power to declare war belongs in the hands of Congress, NOT the president. We need you to get loud in this moment of urgency and demand Congress step in and stop war with Iran now!
Together, we must rush to stop another endless war before it’s too late.
Thanks for taking action,
-Charles

Carpenters Union Thugs Are Attacking Our Signs
Hello Alex,
The most unbelievable thing happened the other day. A union, specifically the Southwest Carpenter’s Union, destroyed multiple of my large, very costly, campaign signs, and then stuck signs up that said this:
Sadly, while I said this is unbelievable, it really isn’t. Unions control politicians like Susie Lee, so they need to try to make sure she gets elected. This is because they know they will not be able to control me!
There is a police investigation into this criminal activity by Susie Lee’s thugs, activity that my team caught them on camera admitting. I intend to prosecute.
(Below is the 7 minute video of the Southwest Carpenters Union members admitting to the crime and trying to intimidate my staff)
Carpenters Union Admits to Vandalism and Harasses Rodimer Staff
In the meantime, I ask that you help me get my signs back up, and quickly. There are still people who haven’t voted and I need to make sure I reach those people so that we can turn this state RED. Can you contribute $25 right now to help make sure Susie Lee’s thugs don’t get away with what they did? That way we can fire Susie Lee and finally bring ethics back to our great state, when I am elected.

Jacob Blake is innocent. But that didn’t stop Kenosha police officers from shooting him 7 times in the back for no reason.
With Daniel Miskinis and David Beth at the helm, there will NEVER be justice for Jacob Blake.
That’s why we’re demanding their immediate resignation. We need 100,000 activists signatures, sign now >>
JUSTICE FOR JACOB BLAKE: DEMAND THE POLICE CHIEF AND SHERIFF RESIGN IMMEDIATELY >>
justice must be served.
Jacob Blake was shot 7 times in the back while getting into his car. He was shot in front of his three small children. He spent the following days in the hospital fighting for his life.
“Dismantling systemic racism in our nation starts with demanding justice & holding offenders accountable.”
\-- Kamala Harris
Jacob Blake is innocent. But his innocence couldn’t protect him from the horrors of police brutality. Just like it couldn’t protect George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and countless more.
What makes this all even worse is that Kenosha cops were seen cozying up to white supremacists in the ensuing protests. Their racism runs deep.
We know that as long as Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis and Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth remain in their positions, there will NEVER be justice for David Blake.
So we’re calling for their immediate resignation in protest of racist police brutality.
We won’t rest until these offenders are held accountable for their crime. Sign on to demand the police chief and sheriff in Kenosha RESIGN →
JUSTICE FOR JACOB BLAKE: DEMAND THE POLICE CHIEF AND SHERIFF RESIGN IMMEDIATELY >>
Black Americans deserve the right to get into their own car, free from harm.
This is an injustice that cannot be ignored. And it will take an army of grassroots activists like you to finally be taken seriously.

View this email in your browser
Alex,
I’m SO PROUD to share with you that our grassroots campaign to replace Ted Yoho just got endorsed by United We Dream, the largest immigrant youth-led community in the country!
Stand with immigrant youth and Adam: chip in to help us replace Ted Yoho>>
From protecting DACA, to fighting ICE’s blatant abuse of human rights, to winning education access for immigrants, UWD has helped lead the fight for immigration justice. Their 400,000 members have put their bodies on the line to defend immigrants’ rights and stop unjust deportations.
That’s why I’m especially humbled by UWD’s faith in our youth-led campaign to fight for a Florida where all immigrants can live healthy and fulfilling lives without the fear of deportation, detention, family separation, or death.
You may know Rep. Ted Yoho as the misogynist who verbally assaulted AOC without a shred of remorse, or as 1 of only 4 people in Congress to vote against making lynching a federal crime. But as one of Trump’s closest allies in Congress, he’s also championed Trump’s hateful immigration agenda since day one.
Yoho cheerled Trump’s wall, proudly and unconditionally supports ICE and its concentration camps, applauded Trump’s gutting of DACA, and helped flame Trump’s fearmongering over immigrant caravans. He’s a threat to immigrant families’ safety and wellbeing not just in our district in Florida, but across the nation.
Chip in $17 today to help us replace him & flip FL-3 in November.
Our campaign is proud to stand with immigrant youth and fight for comprehensive, humane reforms that protect and uplift immigrant families. With your help, we will replace Trump minion Ted Yoho and take the fight for immigration justice to Congress.
In solidarity,
Adam

For weeks, we have seen absolute destruction run rampant in the streets of America.
President Trump is fighting for Law and Order to be restored, but his Democratic adversaries seem to WELCOME this lawlessness!
But the lawlessness and unchecked crime goes beyond the riots from groups like ANTIFA, and into violence and even MURDER.
A recent analysis showed that in the nation’s 50 largest cities (mostly run by Liberal Democrats, of course), reported homicides were up 24% so far this year!
DEMAND LAW AND ORDER
If the Democrats can’t even maintain control of their cities and states, why on earth would we want to trust them with the nation?
If Joe Biden were to win, DEFUNDING THE POLICE and allowing violent rioters to control the narrative and policies would take center stage.
We need someone who is unafraid to stand up to the Liberal mob — WE NEED PRESIDENT TRUMP!
Take a stand before midnight to show that President Trump has your support and that you demand Law and Order in the streets of America! >>
Time is ticking! President Trump needs to know that his Law and Order initiative has your support!

43,"Alex,
The President of the United States has run a concentrated campaign to get his buddy Michael Flynn off the hook for lying to the Federal Bureau of Intelligence (FBI) about conversations he had with Russian government officials -- and unfortunately, as of yesterday, it worked.
The Department of Justice (or should I say, the Department of Injustice) announced their intentions to drop all charges against Michael Flynn.
(This isn’t the first time that Donald Trump has meddled in the legal system for his political pals -- he managed to get his friend Roger Stone a reduced sentence after public lobbying as well.)
Alex -- Let me be clear: this is a disgrace. It is a disgrace that someone who pleaded guilty -- someone who admitted they committed the crime -- to providing false information to the FBI about his conversations with a foreign power has gotten off scot free because they are cronies of the President.
And Attorney General William Barr has been aiding and abetting Donald Trump every step of the way. When questioned about why someone who pleaded guilty was being let off the hook, Barr went on CBS News to say that “people sometimes plead to things that turn out not to be crimes” \-- it makes absolutely no sense.
Will you join me in standing up to this Department of Injustice, Alex? Will you sign my petition demanding that William Barr resign and that integrity get restored to our Justice Department? We’ve gotten thousands of signatures on past petitions calling on Barr to resign, but this new offense requires reinvigorated grassroots action to DEMAND change.
It is clear that integrity does not come naturally to this administration, so we must join together to demand it.

View this email in your browser
# Choose You This Day
July 1, 2020
Dear Alex,
Choose you this day. Those words are familiar. It is likely that you have already finished the phrase in your mind.
In his final address, to the nation of Israel, Joshua stood before the nation that he had led into the Promised Land. He reminded them of God's providential care. He reminded them of God's abundant blessings.
Joshua also warned them of the danger that lurked and would attack the foundation of their freedom. Then Joshua challenged the people to make a willful, conscious, decision to choose.
Joshua concluded with his decision. ""As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."" (Joshua 24:15)
Today, America stands at the point of decision. We are in a time like never before.
The primary issues today are no longer about the size of government, tax policy, or regulation. Today we see mob violence, destruction, and an intentional, planned, assault on America.
What began as calls for the removal of memorial statues, has now taken on the face of mob destruction and violence. Today statues of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt are not only criticized but defaced and damaged.
Princeton University removed Woodrow Wilson's name from its Public Policy Center. The Democrat Party in Orange County, California called for the renaming of the John Wayne airport because of comments he made in an interview with Playboy magazine half a century ago.
This mob frenzy has surpassed mere political correctness. It has now metastasized into a cancer that is out to destroy America itself.
Democrats blame President Trump for the violence while at the same time they call for abolishing the police. Seattle handed over several blocks of the city to a lawless mob who apparently could not settle on the name of their newly formed republic, ""Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone"" (CHAZ) or ""Capitol Hill Organized Protest"" (CHOP).
In the first month of CHAZ/CHOP, there were at least six shootings. After three shootings in a 48 hour time frame, one being fatal, the Mayor of Seattle boldly proclaimed that the city ""will not allow for gun violence to continue in the evenings around Capitol Hill.""
The Mayor's proclamation was so effective that 72 hours later there was another shooting. A week later yet another shooting left a 16 year old dead and a 14 year old in critical condition.
Meanwhile, Democrats, including Sanford Bishop, are characteristically silent about the lawlessness, crime, destruction, and decay. The problem is that Democrats have controlled these areas for decades. What happened in a matter of weeks in CHAZ/CHOP was just Democrat leadership on steroids.
Today, America stands at a critical crossroads. The violence and destruction that we see around our nation share no DNA with the values of the people of the 2nd District.
I am speaking up and standing up for your values. I am speaking up and standing up for you as I challenge Sanford Bishop.
I need you to stand with me. I need you to put skin in the game with me.
I am regularly asked if the Republican party will support our race. Yes they will, but they need to see that the people of the 2nd District are standing up. Now is the time to take a stand.
When you donate to Don Cole for Congress, the money stays with my campaign and is focused right here on my campaign. Your contribution will go to promote your values and you can count on that.
You may have never donated to a political campaign before. Now is the time, today is the day.
We are at a time as never before. Right now, you, not anyone else, but you stand at a point of decision.
Some of my readers have already given generously and sacrificially. If you have not given to my campaign yet, then I ask you to do it now.
The number of individual donors is just as important as how much the donors give. Will you put some skin in the game by donating as little as $2.20 (2nd District in 20) or $20.20 (Send DC to DC in 2020)?

45,"We’re helping launch the biggest grassroots program in the general election It’s been a huge -- and infuriating -- few days for our work on impeachment, and we know Indivisibles across the country are doing everything possible to hold Trump accountable for his crimes. We also know that McConnell and his cronies in the Senate will stop at nothing to protect Trump, and will likely vote to acquit him this week. That means that removing Trump is up to us. That’s why we’re partnering with powerful allies to get Trump out of office for good, and why we’re emailing you about that today, on Iowa caucus day.
Indivisibles,
It’s Iowa caucus day, and Indivisibles across the nation are hard at work. But the primary isn’t the end of the line. We’re also thinking hard about the general election, which is why we’re excited to share some big news: today, we’re announcing Organizing Together 2020 -- our no-longer-secret plan to beat Trump in key battleground states!
Here’s the deal: while Democrats are rightfully busy vetting a nominee, Donald Trump has gotten a months-long head start on the general election campaign in key battleground states. We know that if we wait until July to prepare for the general election then we’ll lose. So Indivisible isn’t waiting.
Today we’re co-launching Organizing Together 2020.
Organizing Together 2020 is a big new coalition that is setting up dozens of canvassing offices in the key battleground states of Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. We’ll be recruiting and training election volunteers NOW instead of waiting for July when the nominee is officially chosen.
By the time we have a nominee, Organizing Together 2020 will have swing state staff hired, volunteers trained, offices buzzing, canvasses running, and resources mobilized and ready to win in the general election. Indivisible is a founding partner co-launching the effort today, and we’re working with partners from labor and groups like Vote Vets and People for the American Way to make this a very big deal.
Right now, we’ve raised about half of the budget to get this done, but we have another $440,000 left to raise to fully fund Indivisible’s part of it. Can you chip in $10 to support Organizing Together 2020 and all of our work? Every cent you donate to Indivisible Action will go towards defeating Trump and saving our democracy.
What comes next? We start building the army to defeat Trump. We’re planning to reach thousands of voters in every one of these key battleground states before the general election on November 3rd. That’s not going to be easy, but as always, we’ve got a plan to make it happen:
1. Open dozens of canvass offices throughout key battleground states, because we know that early infrastructure is the key to scaling up for the general election.
2. Drive thousands of volunteers to those offices throughout the election cycle. We are investing in our people early so that they are able to have the most effective conversations possible. We will need every single one of them in order to win.
3. Train those volunteers to be effective canvassers -- knocking on millions of doors across the country to persuade voters and get out the vote. Face to face conversations are the best way to persuade voters and turn them out to vote. We need to rely on best canvassing practices and massive scale.
4. After the Democratic convention in July, be ready with a massive on-the-ground movement that will be ready to support the nominee and put them in office.
Yes, it costs money to do this. We’re looking to raise $440,000 in grassroots donations. Our piece of this partnership is organizing and volunteer recruitment, so that budget is mostly things like organizing tools (our SMS tool, Hubdialer, an email platform, etc.), data tools and analysis (that’s how we figure out which voters to talk to and how), electoral trainings for groups, and volunteer and organizing staff in all six states.
We say it all the time, but our work truly isn’t possible without you. We’re up against a lot of entrenched interests with a LOT of money: according to CNBC, Trump’s campaign had $102 million in his war-chest going into this year (and that’s before you count all the dark money super PACs spending to reelect him).
We don’t have to match every dollar they spend: our power comes from individual people not from hundred dollar bills. But we do need to raise enough to pay for the tools and resources that support all those thousands of volunteers.
That’s why we’re asking you to help us make Organizing Together 2020 a reality. Can you make a $10 donation to launch this new initiative, support Indivisible Action, and put all our plans for this year in motion?

One last note on the primaries: we know a lot of people have a lot of differing opinions. In truth, some of our partners on this project have very different opinions than we do about the primaries! But any disagreements pale compared to this: we all agree that we absolutely must defeat Donald Trump this year.
We’re going to keep engaging in the primaries in ways that make sense for us, with input from you, the movement. But while that’s happening, and in the spirit of the Indivisible Pledge, we’re getting ready for the main event. And we’re building the infrastructure we’ll need to come together as a progressive movement once the nominee is chosen in July. We hope you’re ready to join us.
In solidarity,
Indivisible Team

Alex,
We just rolled out a brand new slate of 35 endorsements! Even though it's only January, we've already endorsed 125 candidates for the 2020 cycle. We're gearing up to shatter our previous endorsement records and elect a record number of LGBTQ candidates. Will you chip in $20.20 and help us create a Rainbow Revolution on Election Day?
I'm so excited to show you our latest round of candidates - they've all proven they're ready to win. And, we're announcing three new candidates for the United States Senate and House, as well as candidates for down-ballot races. Take a look:

In the battle to reclaim the U.S. Senate for pro-equality forces, Ross LaJeunesse has tossed his hat into the ring. When he wins the Democratic primary, Ross will tackle sitting Senator Susan Collins. Collins has long followed the marching orders of the Trump Administration and has yet to stand against Mitch McConnell's anti-LGBTQ agenda. Winning this seat could mean we can finally pass the pro-equality legislation that McConnell has shoved to the back burner! Chip in to destroy Mitch's majority and send Susan Collins packing. Donate $20.20 or more today!

And we're getting ready to DOUBLE LGBTQ representation in the U.S. House. We're proud to stand with Pat Hackett in Indiana and Tracy Mitrano in New York. Pat will face anti-LGBTQ incumbent Rep. Jackie Walorski, known for derailing hate crimes legislation as a state representative and voting to support LGBTQ discrimination as a Congresswoman. And both Pat and Tracy will make history as the first openly LGBTQ person elected to Congress in their states!
We've got a lot of work to do, Alex, and a lot of big races to win. Taking down Susan Collins, Jackie Walorski and a slate of other anti-LGBTQ candidates will not be easy. To make history, we need you on our team. Will you donate $20.20 or more to win?
Thanks so much for your support - we can't do it without you!

Team — Donald Trump is unhinged, and has once again taken to Twitter to put Americans and the global community at large in even more danger than he did with his reckless actions against Iran yesterday. So we’re asking:
Will you sign the VoteVets petition today? We’re demanding Congress act immediately to stop a catastrophic war with Iran and put a check on President Trump's erratic foreign policy actions. Click here to sign >>
SIGN THE PETITION
First, he escalated tensions by pulling out of the Iran deal. Then, he acted without authorization from Congress and directed a drone strike that assassinated Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top military leader.
Earlier today when asked about his exit strategy he said, “I don’t need exit strategies.”
And now he’s threatening to bomb and destroy 52 cultural sites in Iran, which means he’s officially threatening war crimes on his Twitter account.
He has not considered the consequences of any of these actions. He has no plan. He has no strategy.
Sign the petition right now to join veterans and military families in demanding Congress put a check on Trump’s irresponsible and erratic behavior in order to stop a catastrophic war with Iran:
SIGN THE PETITION
While Trump is in his third week of vacation, he’s putting thousands of Americans and Iranians in greater danger by the hour.
That’s why we need you to join us in calling for action from Congress today.
If you’ve already signed, consider forwarding this link and inviting 5 of your friends and family who also want Congress to take action immediately to stop Trump:

Dear Alex,
When America’s greatness comes only at the expense of others, we all lose. Sadly, I was reminded of this important truth last weekend when Senator Tom Cotton referred to slavery as being “the necessary evil upon which the union was built.”
It is easy to see Cotton’s remarks are disturbing –– even more so when we consider he made this statement to defend his opposition to teaching about the history of slavery in our schools. But, we also should remember that the notion that evil is sometimes necessary for prosperity is not a relic of history or limited to academic debates.
Yesterday on Medium, I dug into Cotton’s remarks and what they mean about how we justify evil today with a piece titled Evil Is Never Necessary In America.
Today in America, business executives accept cutting jobs as a “necessary evil” for improving a company’s quarterly earnings. Policymakers accept warehousing lawbreakers, especially if poor and Black, as a “necessary evil” to reducing crime.
The idea that slavery was a necessary part of America’s founding implies that for some to flourish in our country others must be hurt. As you can read more of my thoughts on Medium, we cannot let these kinds of ideas win out. At a time when the public is collectively examining what our responsibilities are to each other and how to account for the inequality we have tolerated for so long, it behooves us to reconsider and to reject the kinds of “necessary evils” we have accepted before.
Together we can and we must do better.
Sincerely,
Deval Patrick

####  Virginia lawmakers push to expand police decertification law
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press
A white Virginia state trooper yells an expletive-laden threat at a Black motorist who refuses to get out of his car during a traffic stop. Smiling for the driver’s cellphone camera, the trooper remarks, “Watch the show, folks,” then yanks the man out of his car by his neck. The video sparked outrage in Virginia, but under current state law, the trooper’s conduct — unless he’s later convicted of a crime — is not grounds for disqualifying him from working in law enforcement.

####  Computer hackers attack Fairfax County school system
By JOE HEIM, Washington Post (Metered Paywall - 3 articles a month)
Hackers attacked the Fairfax County Public Schools computer system and placed ransomware on some of its systems, a school district spokesperson said Friday. The district, which serves 189,000 students in northern Virginia, said it had recently learned of the attack and it is working with its security experts to investigate the scope of the attack and determine what information was stolen. Ransomware is software used to steal and then threaten publication of data or block access unless a ransom is paid.

The first week of virtual learning in Loudoun County, Virginia, was interrupted by incidents of students using racial slurs, displaying sexual images or popping into the virtual sessions of other classes or schools. “These incidents are contrary to our core beliefs, our commitment to racial equity and other matters of equity as described in the LCPS Equity Statement, and to the expectations we have established for appropriate behavior by students in the virtual environment,” Williams said in a news release.

Virginia Tech likely won’t send students packing this fall, because a shift to all-online classes would do little to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, President Tim Sands said Friday. “I won’t say categorically that we won’t change direction, but, to be perfectly honest, I think what we’re learning is that going remote wouldn’t help that much,” Sands told students at an hour-long virtual town hall.

####  ICE flew detainees to Virginia so the planes could transport agents to D.C. protests
By ANTONIO OLIVO AND NICK MIROFF, Washington Post (Metered Paywall - 3 articles a month)
The Trump administration flew immigrant detainees to Virginia this summer to facilitate the rapid deployment of Homeland Security tactical teams to quell protests in Washington, circumventing restrictions on the use of charter flights for employee travel, according to a current and a former U.S. official. After the transfer, dozens of the new arrivals tested positive for the novel coronavirus, fueling an outbreak at the Farmville, Va., immigration jail that infected more than 300 inmates, one of whom died.

####  King William County Commissioner of the Revenue refuses to cooperate with audit, emails show
By EMILY HOLTER, Tidewater Review
King William Commissioner of the Revenue Sally Pearson refused, on several occasions, to let auditors in her office Sept. 2, according to email correspondence between high-level county officials. Pearson’s refusal to participate in the audit comes nearly six weeks after she declined to take part in the county’s reassessment process, one of the essential functions of her office. It was the reassessment, during which it was revealed that hundreds of properties weren’t being taxed, that prompted County Administrator Bobbie Tassinari to initiate the performance audit of Pearson’s office.

####  Federal grant to help redevelop, reconnect once-segregated pocket of Norfolk
By RYAN MURPHY, Virginian-Pilot (Metered Paywall - 2 articles a month)
The three 1950s-era public housing communities in Norfolk’s St. Paul’s area have long been isolated, surrounded by busy roads and largely cut off from city cross streets. The design is a remnant of racist housing policies that aimed to keep poor and Black residents stuck in their own neighborhoods. A new $14.4 million federal grant announced Friday could change that, helping to reconnect the area to more pedestrian-friendly city streets once St. Paul’s is redeveloped.

Legislation that would have made it easier for citizens to sue police officers for misconduct died this week in Richmond, but that didn’t stop several Virginia Beach leaders from gathering Friday to speak against it. Less than 24 hours after the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 12-3 to kill HB 5013, Mayor Bobby Dyer and Sheriff Ken Stolle met at the city jail with several local legislators, City Council members and law enforcement officials to make their opinions known. “The system worked yesterday,” Stolle said of the committee’s decision. “But we will see this bill again.

The Supreme Court of Virginia has rejected a challenge to the wording of a ballot question tied to a constitutional amendment on redistricting. The lawsuit alleged that the question is “misleading” and “inaccurate,” and written in a way that leaves voters in the dark about the key effects of the amendment on the state’s redistricting process. It asked the Supreme Court of Virginia to compel state election officials to correct it.

As of Thursday, there were almost 400 active cases of COVID-19 detected at the Deerfield Correctional Center in Capron, which houses many of the state’s older and ailing male inmates. In late May, the Virginia Department of Corrections reported there had been 78 cases detected at the prison. On Thursday, the department reported 388 cases — up from 286 the day before — with 18 current hospitalizations and a total of three deaths since the pandemic began.

Barricades went up Friday evening as local officials prepared to remove a Confederate statue on Saturday from the area where white supremacists held their deadly Unite the Right rally three years ago. Albemarle County supervisors voted earlier this summer to take down the figure of a Confederate soldier outside their courthouse, which is located within the city of Charlottesville.

####  With Low Childcare Enrollment, Ashburn, Rust Libraries Reopen
By RENSS GREENE, Loudoun Now
With fewer people than expected enrolling in a county-run childcare program, the two public libraries closed to make room for kids have reopened to the public. The Rust and Ashburn libraries were closed down as the county government sought space for a program to give parents a safe place to leave their kids while parents are at work, since students are not in the school buildings for distance learning. The Distance Learning Child Care Program is open to kids from kindergarten through sixth grade.

Two members of the Portsmouth NAACP attempted — and failed — to file criminal charges against council members Bill Moody and Elizabeth Psimas on Friday, alleging they violated the city charter by telling the police chief to charge people in the Confederate monument vandalism. NAACP chapter President James Boyd and Vice President Louie Gibbs went to a magistrate seeking the misdemeanor charges a day after The Virginian-Pilot reported on emails in which Moody wrote, “I am requesting that the law be enforced” and Psimas agreed.

The Gloucester School Board asked a full federal appeals court to hear the long-running transgender bathroom case — a sign the board isn’t giving up on defending its policy despite two federal court rulings against it. But requests for a full hearing at the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals are granted only rarely — less than 1 percent of the time — which could mean the next stop could be the U.S. Supreme Court.

Voters have since the 1980s rejected various forms of consolidation referendums between the city and county governments.

####  Here's what the critics of W&L's 'How to overthrow the state' class missed
Roanoke Times Editorial (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month)
Some things are too good to be true. That inheritance from the Nigerian prince. The promise that “one size fits all.” Those pop-up ads that promise “single girls in your area are dying to meet you.” And the fevered claim that has rocketed around the mediasphere that Washington & Lee University is teaching students “how to overthrow the state.” This seemed to fit perfectly into the mindset that academia is an elitist enclave of radicals who are busily molding impressionable young minds to hate America.

By JEFF E. SCHAPIRO, Richmond Times-Dispatch (Access to this article limited to subscribers)
For Levar Stoney, politics is strictly business. There’s a lesson in that for another young man in a hurry — one who has no use for Stoney: Justin Fairfax. Running in a crowded field for a second term as Richmond mayor — amid racial turmoil, police violence, a cratering economy and the coronavirus — Stoney needs all the help he can get. The last person you’d think he’d turn to for an endorsement is the governor whose resignation he demanded 19 months ago for alleged bigotry.

By JENNIFER CARROLL FOY, published in Roanoke Times (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month)
As a Cadet at Virginia Military Institute, I learned to put service above self. Some of my classmates at VMI enlisted and became soldiers, others went on to live lives of public service, but all with the same goal: serve our country, and our fellow Americans, with honor and integrity. Be a person of character. Frankly, in this moment, we need people of character at the helm more than ever — leaders who understand service over self-interest.

####  Preis: Qualified immunity and government accountability
By JOHN F. PREIS, published in Richmond Times-Dispatch (Metered Paywall - 7 articles a month)
If a cop violates your constitutional rights, should you be entitled to any money? That’s a question the Virginia General Assembly has been debating regarding an obscure legal doctrine called “qualified immunity.” Most people are surprised to learn that you can’t necessarily get compensation when a police officer violates your rights. After all, the rest of us have to pay for the harms we cause.
John F. Preis is a professor of law and associate dean in the University of Richmond School of Law.

Donald Trump has been abusing his position since the first day he became president.

But Congress will only charge Trump if it’s what the American people want.

Alex, let's talk about Roe v. Wade.
This historic decision affirmed that women have a right to privacy when they make deeply personal health care decisions, and that the government must not infringe upon that autonomy.
This is about fundamental human rights.
And yet, Donald Trump will almost certainly nominate a Supreme Court justice committed to overturning Roe v. Wade and allowing politicians to intervene in women's health care.
The decision to terminate a pregnancy is a deeply personal one. It belongs to individual women, who know themselves and their own health -- not to politicians who would impose their personal views.
I run a business that investigates organized crime and corruption for news organizations worldwide, and we have investigated and exposed how dangerous, unqualified, and unregulated abortion providers kill thousands of women in places where safe abortion services are not available legally.
I will fight with every bone in my body to protect the privacy of women's health care in America, Alex.
This is not about partisan politics -- it's about health, human rights, and privacy from government intrusion.
As Senator, I will only vote to confirm federal judges who pledge to uphold Roe v. Wade.
But I am running against a limitlessly-funded extremist who is so arrogant, he believes he is entitled to make these decisions for women in Georgia. If he is elected to another six-year term in the Senate, he will vote to confirm dozens of federal judges who will seize and destroy women's right to privacy in health care and to safe, legal abortion. Please help me win this race so I can fight to defend Roe v. Wade in the United States Senate.

Here's an update –
After blocking key witnesses from testifying in front of the Senate, Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans have voted to acquit President Trump of all charges.
Simply put, this is a shameless abuse of power by the GOP Senate majority in order to protect Trump at all costs. The American people deserve the full story about the crimes that led House Democrats to impeach Donald Trump, and now they may never get it.
This vote – and Trump's actions since that day – show that Trump and the Republicans think they're untouchable. But they're not. If we organize and mobilize more than ever before, we WILL make state Republicans pay for this at the ballot box in November.
If Republicans won't hold Trump accountable, then it's up to us to take action. Chip in right now to help defeat Trump's allies in the states and send a clear, unambiguous signal that GOP legislators will pay a price for ignoring the Constitution >>

With Senate Republicans refusing to even hold a fair trial, this case was doomed from the start. And now that Trump's been acquitted, the GOP's true colors have never been clearer.
Republicans aren't working for the best interests of Americans – they're willing to protect Trump at any and all costs.
But Mitch McConnell doesn't get the final word here: You do. This year's elections give us the chance to oust Trump and his Republican allies. Not just the senators who helped cover up Trump's crimes, but Republicans at every level who are complicit in the GOP's cruel and corrupt agenda.
It's up to us to make state Republicans pay for their blatant abuse of power. Pitch in now so we can finally hold the Republicans who support Trump accountable for their actions.

55,"The tragic death of Eric Garner was six years before the murder of George Floyd earlier this year. Both men's last words were ""I can't breathe"".
Melissa Watson Logo
Hello Friends,
Six years ago today, on July 17, 2014, a man named Eric Garner died in New York City's Staten Island when an NYPD police officer put him in a chokehold while arresting him. (Chokeholds banned by the NYPD in 1993.) Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who murdered Garner, walked free of criminal charges.
This tragedy was six years before the murder of George Floyd earlier this year when a cop held him to the ground with a knee at his neck for 9 minutes.
Both men were unarmed, both were being brought in on non-violent crimes, both men were Black — and both men uttered the very same final words: ""I can't breathe"" before having their lives taken from them by police officers.
These words, “I can’t breathe,” have become a rallying cry the stifling harm that systemic racism has posed on Black Americans, particularly and most horrifyingly, from our law enforcement — those who are meant to protect us.
We must make criminal justice and police reform a priority and elect leaders who understand the urgency of such change. I plan to seek justice for Eric, George, and too many others who have lost their lives from the systemic racism within our establishments. There is so much left to fight for.
If I were in Congress right now, I would start by pushing for the Democratic Justice in Policing Act, which has already passed the House. This bill includes banning chokeholds and limiting no-knock warrants, and it also requires police departments to submit data on their practices to the federal government. In America, we should not have TWO systems of justice. Everyone should be subject to the same rule of law \-- and I hope to continue this fight in Washington.
But for today, please keep Eric Garner and his family in your thoughts and continue your fight for racial justice.
Together, we can do better.

Did you see the news? Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser, was arrested and charged with FRAUD for the “Build the Wall” GoFundMe scam.
This is just another example of Trump’s corruption and how he has surrounded himself with crooks and criminals -- and their behavior is all enabled by the rogue Attorney General, Bill Barr.
While Trump calls himself the president of “law and order”, it’s clear that he and his cronies believe they’re above the law. We cannot afford four more years of criminal activity in the White House, and we can’t afford to have any enablers of this behavior in Congress.
I’m running for re-election to stand up against this lawlessness. Could you send over a donation to my campaign so I can keep fighting in Congress to hold all of these people and their enablers accountable for their crimes?
DONATE NOW >>
It is truly disturbing how many Trump associates have been arrested, charged and found guilty of crimes -- from Paul Manafort to Rick Gates, Michael Flynn and now Steve Bannon? And somehow they all seem to be getting sweetheart deals courtesy of AG William Barr... We must defeat this corruption and bring decency back.
I’m appalled that people so close to the White House and president have been involved in so many criminal activities. This is insulting to the office of the president, and insulting to the people of America who want leaders that surround themselves with good, decent people.
We have choices to make when it comes to the leaders we want to represent us in Congress, and in the White House. Having criminals in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue who are enriching themselves for personal gain or lying to cover up the president’s crimes cannot stand.
Please make a contribution to my campaign today if you can -- every dollar counts and will help re-elect me to represent Georgia’s 4th district once again, and I couldn’t be prouder to stand with you and against this corruption.

# Rogue, Secret ATF Interpretations of Pistols Seek to Undermine President Trump and Criminalize Gun Owners

## ATF Seeks to Help Elect Biden Because It’s Good for Gun Control
Dear Alex,
In an apparent reversal of a longstanding interpretation of the statutory and regulatory definition of “handguns” under the Gun Control Act (GCA), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is ready to stick it to gun owners.
It appears the ATF has determined that certain handguns which fire ammunition that is traditionally used in rifles – or handguns made from receivers that have also been used to produce rifles (including many of the AR or AK variant) – are not eligible for importation.
The agency seems to have determined this by using novel and restrictive standards in a revised importation test, which is arbitrarily used to evaluate whether a weapon meets the statutory “sporting purposes” requirement. Congress has never defined what “sporting purposes” means.
The ATF also apparently suggested that legally-imported firearms “may wrongly have been approved for importation” and that these “firearms may require reevaluation.”
While the scope of this suggested “reevaluation” is not clear, if the GCA interpretation is applied for purposes of domestic firearms, then such weapons could meet the National Firearms Act (NFA) definition of “Any Other Weapon (AOW).” If certain firearms were determined to be AOWs, the firearms would be subjected to mandatory registration, taxation, travel restrictions and a lengthy post-purchase, pre-delivery waiting period. Gun owners would then be subject to criminal prosecution for possession of an unregistered NFA weapon, a charge that carries a punishment of up to ten years of imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
GOA Senior Vice President Erich Pratt stated the following:
> Despite an executive action from President Trump prohibiting the imposition of ‘new standards’ without express authorization by law, the apparent interpretation by a rogue and reckless ATF has implications that could criminalize millions of otherwise non-violent and law-abiding gun owners. This continues to demonstrate why the National Firearms Act should be repealed and the agency itself should be fully dismantled.
>
> It also demonstrates why President Trump recently issued an Executive Order creating a new classification of ‘Schedule F’ employees. This new classification allows the President to ‘drain the swamp’ by firing policy-making employees who would rather go rogue than follow the law.
>
> The recent Honey Badger gun ban and revelation of absurd private classification rulings represents a pro-Biden ‘October Surprise’ by an out-of-control, anti-gun ATF.
>
> By disregarding orders to stand down, rogue ATF agents seem prepared to help usher in a Joe Biden Administration, especially because their actions appear to be purposefully timed to anger President Trump’s base immediately before an election.
>
> ATF’s actions are just a taste of what is to come in Joe Biden’s gun controlled-America. The Biden gun control plan seeks to treat many commonly-owned, semi-automatic rifles as NFA weapons, which endangers the freedom of tens of millions of peaceful individuals who own these guns, possession in and of itself should not be a crime.

62,"Today, I voted to acquit President Donald Trump on both articles of impeachment in the United States Senate. [[URL REDACTED]]
Dear Alex,
Today, I voted to acquit President Donald Trump on both articles of impeachment in the United States Senate.
First, I am glad the Senate soundly rejected impeachment and did not remove President Trump from office.
The articles of impeachment brought to the Senate from the Democrats in the House of Representatives represent an assault on the presidency itself and the weaponization of impeachment as a political tool.
I also believe that the impeachment effort was driven by a level of partisanship and 'Ends Justify the Means' behavior the American people have rejected.
The proper way to end this matter was a vote to acquit and allow the American people to vote for or against President Trump in November – not to remove him from office and prevent him from running for reelection.
Finally, I have detailed my views below if you want additional information about how I reached my decision on this important vote.
Sincerely,
Lindsey Graham
Lindsey Graham
United States Senator
* * *
THE PROCESS USED IN THE HOUSE TO CONSTRUCT THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT WAS FLAWED:
I feel compelled to condemn the impeachment process used in the House of Representatives because I believe it was devoid of basic, fundamental due process.
This impeachment was completed within 78 days and had a spirit of partisanship and revenge that, if accepted by the Senate, would lead to the weaponization of impeachment against future presidents.
In the House of Representatives:
* President Trump was entirely shut out of the evidence gathering stage in the House Intelligence Committee.
* President Trump was denied the right to counsel, right to cross-examine, and right to call witnesses.
* Much of the evidence gathered against President Trump by the House Intelligence Committee consisted of inadmissible hearsay.
* The House Judiciary Committee Impeachment hearings were, for lack of a better term, a sham.
More importantly, during the Senate trial the House managers admitted the reason they did not seek testimony from President Trump's closest advisers – former National Security Adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney – was because it would have required them to go to court and slowed their effort to impeach President Trump before the presidential election began.
It was a calculated decision to deal the courts out of President Trump's impeachment inquiry due to a political timetable.
With today's Senate vote to acquit President Trump, I hope the Senate has sent a clear message that this should never, ever happen again.
THE CASE AGAINST THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT:
As to the substance of the allegations against President Trump:
The Obstruction of Congress article is literally impeaching the President because he chose to follow the advice of the White House Counsel, the Department of Justice and was willing to use constitutional privileges in a manner consistent with every other president.
This article should be soundly rejected, not only in this case, but also in the future. Whether one likes President Trump or not, he is the president and has privileges attached to his office. To impeach him for exercising those privileges is unprecedented.
The Abuse of Power article of impeachment is beyond vague, does not allege criminal misconduct, and requires the Senate to engage in a subjective analysis of President Trump's motives and actions. It also represents an existential threat to the presidency.
The House managers argued the sole and exclusive purpose of freezing aid to Ukraine was for the private, political benefit of President Trump. It is clear to me that there is ample evidence that the actions of Hunter Biden and Vice President Biden were inappropriate and undercut American foreign policy.
Moreover, there was evidence in the record that officials in Ukraine were actively speaking against candidate Trump and were pulling for former Secretary of State Clinton. Based on the overwhelming amount of evidence of inappropriate behavior by the Bidens and statements by State Department officials about certain Ukrainians' beliefs that one American candidate would be better than the other would, I found it eminently reasonable for the President to be concerned about corruption in Ukraine, election interference, and the behavior of Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter.
It remains hard for me to believe that Vice President Biden was an effective messenger for reform efforts in Ukraine while his son Hunter was receiving $3 million from Burisma, one of Ukraine's most corrupt companies.
It is obvious to me that after the Mueller Report, President Trump viewed the House impeachment inquiry as a gross double standard when it comes to investigations. The House launched an investigation into his phone call with President Zelensky. At the same time, the House showed no interest in the actions of Vice President Biden and Hunter Biden.
The President, in my view, was justified in asking the Ukrainians to look into the circumstances surrounding the firing of Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma, and whether his termination benefited Hunter Biden and Burisma.
It is clear to me that the phone call focused on burden sharing, corruption, and election interference in an appropriate manner. The most vexing question was how President Trump was supposed to deal with these legitimate concerns.
THE HOUSE DOUBLE STANDARD:
The House managers suggest that President Trump could not have asked the Attorney General to investigate these concerns because that would be equivalent to President Trump asking for an investigation of a political rival. However, in the next moment, the House managers declare the proper way for President Trump to deal with those allegations would have been to ask the Attorney General to investigate.
They cannot have it both ways.
I believe that it is fair to criticize President Trump's over-reliance on his private attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate alleged corruption and conflicts of interest regarding the Bidens and Burisma. However, I do not find this to be a remotely impeachable offense and believe it would be beneficial for the country to find other ways to deal with such matters in the future.
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT CASE DOES NOT MEET REMOVAL STANDARD:
Assuming the facts — in the light most favorable to the House managers – that for a period of time the aid was suspended by President Trump to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and election interference, I find both articles fail as impeachable offenses.
I find this to be the case even if we assume additional facts from Mr. Bolton are accurate.
The simple fact is the Ukrainians received the military aid and did not open the requested investigation.
The allegations contained in this impeachment are not what the Founding Fathers had in mind as high crimes or misdemeanors. Our Founding Fathers, in my view, envisioned serious, criminal misconduct that would shake the foundation of the American constitutional system.
The Nixon Impeachment had broad, bipartisan support once the facts were revealed. The Clinton Impeachment started with bipartisan support in the House and ended with bipartisan support in the Senate, even though it fell well short of the two-thirds vote required to remove a president.
I hope my decision to vote not guilty on both articles of impeachment is seen as a rejection of WHAT the House of Representatives did and HOW they did it.
To remove a President from office requires conduct that shakes the very foundation of our constitutional system.
This impeachment effort fell far short of that high standard.

Laura Loomer for Congress
Patriot,
Four years ago today, ISIS terrorist Omar Mateen gunned down 49 people in the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Florida.
Following the terrorist attack, the media and Democrat politicians labeled it a hate crime against the LGBTQ community and immediately began the call to restrict our Second Amendment rights.
But their narrative was misleading.
After failing to gain entry to Disney World, Mateen’s original target, he chose Pulse nightclub as the location of his terrorist attack.
The Islamic terrorist was outraged by the killing of ISIS leader Abu Waheeb a month earlier, which is why he stormed the gay nightclub, massacring 49 people, holding others hostage, while pledging allegiance to ISIS.
But democrats still deny it was an act of Islamic terrorism to this day.
Ilhan Omar posted on Twitter, ""Let’s remember the attack for what it was: a hate crime against the LGBTQIA+ community.""
Just hours ago, Nancy Pelosi called it a ""shocking act of hatred.""
Other Democrats like my opponent Lois Frankel are refusing to admit this was an act of Islamic terrorism, and are instead attacking law abiding gun owners.
Islamic Terrorism doesn’t fit the narrative of Democrats in this critical election year. Their ""hate America"" agenda bolsters terrorists and some Democrats like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib work directly with groups that are officially designated as terrorist organizations. Ilhan Omar once advocated for nine men in her district who joined ISIS, asking a judge to lessen their sentencing.
This is why I’m headed to Washington. And I need your help to get there.
Help me honor the American lives lost to Islamic Terrorism by allowing me to actively fight against those who would go so far as to change the narrative to fit their agenda.
I have to go back to Ilhan Omar’s quote, ""Let’s remember the attack for what it was . . . ""
That’s a shameful, outrageous lie!
FOURTY-NINE lives were lost on this day four years ago. FOURTY-NINE men and women were stalked and many were shot at point blank range by an ISIS TERRORIST.
Let’s not forget the attack for what it was . . . ISLAMIC TERRORISM.
Help me get to Washington so that next year, on the fifth anniversary of this attack, I can remind Ilhan Omar and hand her the names of the men and women killed by an ISIS terrorist.
Thank you again for all that you do.

I knew that when I signed up to run for Congress as a Black female Republican it wouldn’t be easy. Running for public office requires for one to put it all on the line.
For the past 25 years, I’ve spent my time raising five children and educating the children of my fellow Americans. I have no dirty laundry of which to speak – however, it does take some getting used to seeing your name in the newspaper, your face on a website, or in digital ads.
But the most challenging part of running for Congress as a conservative Republican woman is the names, the insults and the racial slurs the trolls on the internet have lobbed my way, seemingly only for one of two reasons:
1. Because I’m a female Republican of color with views of my own – which often diverge with others in the Black community.
2. Because racism is alive and well in the United States.

I have thick skin – these comments don’t bother me personally. What does bother me is that there are people out there that don’t seem to believe there is a place for a conservative like me in the Republican Party – or because of the color of my skin I’m expected to be a Democrat.
Some of the comments above are, indeed, from self-identified Democrats. Say what you want about President Trump, but …
* Would a racist president stand for pro-life legislation when the majority of babies impacted by abortion are babies with disabilities and babies of color?
* Would a racist prioritize reducing prison sentences for non-violent crimes which disproportionately affect minority communities?
* Would a racist give the most money to historically black colleges and universities of any recent president?

Alex,
By now I'm sure you've heard, Democrats forced the vote yesterday and have officially IMPEACHED President Trump.
Here's the kicker: Nancy Pelosi has already admitted this was all a sham and that the Dems' impeachment effort has been going on for ""two and a half"" years.
This morning things got even [[URL REDACTED]] has announced she's going to sit on impeachment. Essentially she REFUSES to send the articles to the Senate until she thinks there is a chance that the Senate will remove President Trump from office.
Pelosi is truly acting as judge and jury.
So, I need to know if YOU will help set the record straight and join CDP's official Impeachment Defense Team.
We need to tell President Trump right away if you've got his back -- add your name below!
CDP'S OFFICIAL IMPEACHMENT DEFENSE TEAM
I, by digitally signing my name below, do hereby signal my acceptance to become a member of CDP'S IMPEACHMENT DEFENSE TEAM. I will not stand on the sidelines while liberal Democrat forces, unable to defeat President Trump at the ballot box in a fair election, seek to usurp the will of the American people using impeachment to REMOVE Donald Trump from office.
Alex Brown
[[EMAIL_REDACTED]] 32009
DIGITALLY SIGN >>
Please, act now -- before it's too late! To be effective the IMPEACHMENT DEFENSE TEAM needs to quickly reach an additional 50,000 members -- and that means that your signature is of the utmost importance!
I have been warning everyone how the Democrats have been cooking up this plot to remove the President from office, and now their plan is in full swing!
That is why I'm asking you to join CDP'S IMPEACHMENT DEFENSE TEAM immediately.
We must assemble this team now to actively counter their unprecedented attack -- and we need you on our team. So, please don't delay, click here to sign your name and join CDP'S IMPEACHMENT DEFENSE TEAM.
We are amassing a team of stalwart defenders of President Donald Trump for the sole purpose of defending him and preventing the liberal left from undoing the will of the voters. With your help, we will match them blow for blow by:
* Advocating for President Trump on news outlets -- who who will have us on -- across the country, including CNN, FoxNews, MSNBC and everything in between.
* Running hard-hitting ads across all mediums, including internet, radio, TV and print.
* Rallying our base of supporters to fight back against the lies, deceit and mud-slinging of the Democrats.
* Engaging in online efforts to coalesce activists in support of President Trump and against the sinister powers that are trying to defeat him.
* Supporting deserving candidates that are facing tough re-election bids from a Democratic Party desperate to proceed with impeachment.
This effort will not be easy and it certainly won't come without significant cost.
While our adversaries have sugar-daddy donors like George Soros and Hollywood, we rely solely on your support.
That is why, in addition to joining our IMPEACHMENT DEFENSE TEAM, I am also calling on you to become one of our financial partners with a donation today.
Defend President Trump and help re-elect President Trump in 2020!
Alex, I can't stress this enough. The anti-Trump forces are strong and FULL of hate for him and his policies. They will stop at nothing and will not be satisfied until President Trump is removed from the White House.
So, again, without delay:
1. Join CDP'S IMPEACHMENT DEFENSE TEAM by signing your name to the linked petition; and
2. after that, make your generous Defend Trump contribution today.
I greatly look forward to you joining our team!
For Liberty, Freedom, and JUSTICE for all,
Senator Ted Harvey (R-CO)
Chairman, Committee to Defend the President
P.S. The Democrats have finally done it. They've impeached President Trump. In their eyes, his conservative achievements thus far are grounds for the ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" requirement for impeachment. We must not let them succeed. So, please, without delay, join CDP'S IMPEACHMENT DEFENSE TEAM by signing your name and make your most generous contribution today.

Workplace Discrimination
Dear Friend,
Today, the Supreme Court delivered a landmark win for equality and justice in our country. In a 6-3 decision, the Court ruled that gender identity and sexual orientation are protected from workplace discrimination under Title VII of the Civil RIghts Act of 1964. Discrimination against LGBTQ persons, however, continues and is a goal of the current Administration and its supporters in Congress, including Jackie Walorski.
The decision highlights what is at stake in November. Jackie Walorski is virulently anti-LGBTQ. Pat Hackett will be the first openly LGBTQ member of Congress from Indiana and believes in Dignity and Justice for All. Unlike Jackie, Pat understands that discrimination is not a Hoosier or American value.
In 2016, Jackie offered her full support to the Russell Amendment, a horrific piece of legislation that made government funding of discrimination against LGBTQ persons under the guise of religious liberty perfectly legal. Jackie’s view was extreme and out of step with the bipartisan main. Jackie also opposed marriage equality and hate crime legislation that includes LGBTQ protections. She continues to oppose the Equality Act.
Jackie is out of step with the goodness of the people of this District. She is harmful to LGBTQ families and proud in her support of the Pence/Trump Administration. Can you invest in our campaign to send Pat Hackett to Washington as our Representative and advocate for Dignity and Justice for All?

Friend,
The future of our country and our state is on the line. Chaos, anarchy and violent crime has gripped cities across New York and our leaders have turned their backs on the brave heroes in law enforcement who keep us safe.
While Cuomo, de Blasio and New York Democrats seek to limit the rights and freedoms of law-abiding New Yorkers, dangerous criminals are allowed free rein.
That is why I am writing to you today to ask you to renew your New York Republican Party membership for the 2020 election cycle.
This is no time to sit back--our mission is more critical than ever. Democrats in New York have already delivered a disastrous end to bail laws that are putting violent criminals right back onto the streets. They have already gutted the NYPD's budget and they won't be happy until they have completely dismantled everything that makes our country so special.
We’re counting on loyal members like you to help us ensure our strong Republican candidates have the resources they need to fight back against this extremism.
According to our records, you have not yet renewed your New York Republican Party membership for the 2020 election cycle.
Make sure you stand up and are counted. If you don’t renew soon, you will miss access to critical information about the 2020 election cycle, including President Trump’s reelection and our important congressional and state legislative races.
You must act now.
Get your exclusive 2020 NYGOP Membership Card TODAY!
President Trump is counting on us to deliver him a big re-election victory, and he told me personally how important it is to him to win right here in New York.
We worked tirelessly to recruit strong Republicans to run for office and I’m so excited about the slate of new fighters who are running this year to restore common sense and balance to government.
Everything is on the line.
Restoring two-party government is essential to New York’s future. Our wins this year will preserve the New York Republican Party for the next decade after redistricting.
Democrats’ extreme policies have already driven more than a million New Yorkers to other states and we are facing an even greater mass exodus thanks to coronavirus and the unraveling of our public safety.
We cannot afford to let this radical agenda gain a permanent foothold in New York.
We can stop all of this NOW, and we WILL.
It’s time for common sense to make a comeback in New York and it starts now with the NYGOP.
As a sustaining 2020 member, you will play a vital role in our New York GOP operations. If we’re going to win again, we’re going to need every member to renew their commitment to the NYGOP.
Can we count on you to renew your 2020 New York Republican membership today with a generous donation of $25 today? When we receive your contribution, we will ship you an exclusive 2020 membership card.
FOR $25 SECURE YOUR OFFICIAL 2020 REPUBLICAN MEMBERSHIP TODAY
Your membership goes directly toward helping our Republican candidates WIN. Please contribute $25 or more to ensure our New York Republican Party can deliver big victories this November.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Nick Langworthy,
Chairman of the NYGOP

We need to win nine races to flip the Texas House
We have 22 opportunities to do so. And if we do, then we can change Texas politics for a decade.
Imagine the impact of a progressive Texas Legislature leading redistricting. That means expanding Medicaid, increasing funding for public schools, using the Texas Rainy Day Fund to help every day Texans, and more.
We can do it. Many of these seats overlap several counties so if you live in a red, blue, or purple county at the presidential level - every vote counts at the legislative level!

# More Progress
Whether Dan Patrick agrees or not, it is time to take down Confederate monuments across Texas.
This week the RNC featured one of Trump’s favorite congressmen, Dan Crenshaw. We didn’t want to hear from him, so we gave the spotlight to his progressive challenger, Sima Ladjevardian.
Gov. Abbott was right to expand early vote by a week, but now Republicans are suing to take it away. Even when they get something right, they find a way to screw it up!
There has been a 700% increase in crimes committed by White House advisors during Trump Administration. Putting him in charge for “law and order” is like asking the wolf to guard the sheep.
Progress Texas is looking for a communications intern to join our team for the fall semester. Interns will receive $15/hour and the position is remote. Apply today!

Lerah Lee for Congress
Alex,
I knew that when I signed up to run for Congress it wouldn’t be easy. Running for public office requires for one to put it all on the line.
For the past 25 years, I’ve spent my time raising five children and educating the children of my fellow Americans. I have no dirty laundry of which to speak – however, it does take some getting used to seeing your name in the newspaper, your face on a website, or in digital ads.
But the most challenging part of running for Congress as a conservative Republican woman is the names, the insults and the racial slurs the trolls on the internet have lobbed my way, seemingly only for one of two reasons:
1. Because I’m a female Republican of color with views of my own – which often diverge with others in the Black community.
2. Because racism is alive and well in the United States.
Send A Black Conservative
To Congress
Notice some of the more eloquent comments I’ve received in feedback from previous emails I’ve sent out to you and others around the country: ALERT: if you have an aversion to foul language – STOP reading now.
Notable Comments:
* “Truth is you’re just a “n****r”
* As far as reparations are concerned, the N*****S owe the white man reparations
* “You are screwed to believe Republicans will ever do any good for anyone but themselves”
* “Turn coat, Uncle Tom”
* “You’re a f******g uncle Thomasina dancing for the GOP”
* “F**k Off Racist “B***H”
* “Sellout”
* “I am for no black that is racist. And you sure are”
Stand Against Racism
Donate Today
I have thick skin – these comments don’t bother me personally. What does bother me is that there are people out there that don’t seem to believe there is a place for a conservative like me in the Republican Party – or because of the color of my skin I’m expected to be a Democrat.
Some of the comments above are, indeed, from self-identified Democrats. Say what you want about President Trump, but …
* Would a racist president stand for pro-life legislation when the majority of babies impacted by abortion are babies with disabilities and babies of color?
* Would a racist prioritize reducing prison sentences for non-violent crimes which disproportionately affect minority communities?
* Would a racist give the most money to historically black colleges and universities of any recent president?
As Republicans, we should be so proud.

Just like EVERY OTHER AMERICAN, I’m entitled to my own opinion and my choice of political party.
Like every other email requesting financial support for my campaign that I’ve sent out, I fully expect to receive negative feedback.
What I won’t tolerate is being the target of racial slurs simply because of what I stand for.
If you’re pro-life, pro-business, a supporter of limited government and want to keep your private health insurance – then I’m asking you to stand with me today so that I can go to Washington to fight for you!
I'm so grateful to you, Alex,
Blessings always,
