I wanted to send you a quick note about why Kathleen is depending on your support this November.\\nWe’re now 26 days away from the General Election and the choice for Montanans is clear: Kathleen Williams is the only candidate fighting for our best interests. Just take a peek at Matt Rosendale’s record:\\n1. As Insurance Commissioner, he has pushed healthcare plans that don't cover preexisting conditions.\\n2. He supported backdoor legislation to make it easier to transfer and sell off public lands.\\n3. And he continues to be a party puppet ready to slash taxes for the wealthy and gut Social Security.\\nIt’s clear as day: Matt Rosendale will always put his party over the people of Montana.

But it’s critical that we maintain our social distance — even at parks. We’re hopeful that residents will continue to take the measures seriously so this soft opening can continue.\\nHere’s some of what I’m keeping an eye on this week:\\n\\\\- Limited Reopening of Beaches: Today, San Diego's beaches are open to surfers, swimmers, and runners on the sand. Please note that group gatherings and lying down on the beach are not allowed.\\n\\\\- CARES Act Funding: Last week, I sent a letter to Mayor Faulconer urging him to maximize the $248 million in federal CARES Act funding that we’ve been allocated. As City Council President, it’s my goal to make sure our most vulnerable are not left behind.\\n\\\\- Otay Mesa Detention Center: I’ve called on Gavin Newsom to join me in calling for a drastic reduction in the number of people held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center where a COVID-19 outbreak has infected detainees and staff.

Like many others, I traveled to a district with greater funding and resources to help aid my academic and career trajectory. From an early age, I saw the economic, racial and social disparities between communities. The school in my home district did not have the funding for equitable resources to equitably support students.\\nThis opportunity helped pave the path for my college degree. My parents and I worked multiple jobs to get me through college, and I graduated as a first-generation student at San Diego State University.\\nI became a community organizer. Then, I eventually became City Council President. Now, I\\'m running for Congress.\\nBut my experience should not be the norm. In the richest country on earth, there is no excuse. Our schools are underfunded, our teachers are underpaid, and so many of our students don\\'t easily have access to resources needed to achieve their best self. Communities bear the brunt of these inequities.\\nIt\\'s why I am running for Congress. But I can\\'t get there without your help, especially because I am going toe-to-toe with a wealthy self-funder. Can you chip in $5 right now?\\nOn this day 46 years ago, the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 became federally recognized in the United States, prohibiting discrimination of students, faculty, and staff on all fronts. It was a step forward in making schools more equitable for every student. However, we have so much more to do!\\nOn this year\\'s EEOA anniversary, we celebrate all students, and we promise to create equitable opportunities for all.\\nIn Congress, I will continue to be a champion for schools and for our students -- so that every child, no matter where they live, has the opportunity to succeed and thrive. If that\\'s a mission you can get behind, chip in $5 to my campaign today.\\nEveryone\\'s voice is valued and deserves to be uplifted and that must start early. The educational environment and resources given to children have impacted their childhood and economic mobility. We must ensure all students have equitable resources, no matter what their socioeconomic status is and no matter whether kids are learning in classrooms or online.\\nThese beliefs I hold make the endorsements of this campaign by the California Federation of Teachers and National Education Association more meaningful. Having the backing of the biggest teachers\\' unions means they believe in what we stand for: Better pay and facilities for our educators and better education for our children. The support of Congress to let the teachers get their jobs done.\\nIf you want to see our students succeed, help elect a leader who navigated a system stacked against kids like me to see success. Chip in $5 to this campaign today.\\nIn solidarity,\\nGeorgette Gómez\\nP.S.

This ruling doesn't change that. But, the Equality Act -- which is still sitting on Mitch McConnell’s desk -- would put an end to all LGBTQ discrimination.\\nWe need to continue our work, and one big way to do that is by electing the most LGTBQ Congress in history.

This is not just an environmental emergency -- it's a nationwide disaster, and that's why I believe in the power of the Green New Deal.\\nI’ve dedicated much of my career to addressing the climate crisis. At a young age, I developed a passion for the environment when I realized the air my neighborhood wasn’t as clean as in other areas in town. Since then I’ve always believed that no kid should be forced to breathe polluted air just because of their zip code.\\nPassing the Green New Deal will take the immediate action that’s needed to address the climate crisis. Add your name to our petition if you want to see the Green New Deal passed.\\nSIGN THE PETITION\\nAs San Diego grows, we can and should be a model for the nation with healthy, affordable, sustainable neighborhoods for all our families. The Green New Deal takes the meaningful steps needed to address the climate emergency, including renewable energy and transportation concerns. It also addresses the need for protection of those risking their lives working in the dangerous and harmful industries. Our workers will never be left behind. By shifting from reliance on fossil fuels to a greener industry, we can empower our workers and help them thrive in a safer work environment, providing advanced protections and wages that they’ve long deserved.\\nAs part of the work I did with the Environmental Health Coalition and now on the City Council, I’ve worked to influence our environmental policies, pushing for more bold, progressive change -- that’s why in the city of San Diego, we’re well on our way to achieving 100 percent renewable energy and cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2035.\\nBut we can do more. I’ve long pushed for the implementation of San Diego’s landmark Climate Action Plan, and that’s why I’m advocating for the Green New Deal. Bold reform and concrete plans are what we need to fix this problem.\\nIn Congress, I’ll continue to push for the creation of jobs in clean energy, the increase of investments in energy efficiency and technology, the investment in world-class public transportation, and the transformation of the agriculture system for more sustainable farming.\\nI’ve always fought and will always fight to make sure our underserved communities are the first to benefit from implemented environmental policies. These communities have been on the front lines of pollution for far too long.\\nThe types of changes proposed in the Green New Deal will create safer work environments and bring stimulation to our economy -- all while making the air safer to breathe for us and for future generations.\\nThere's more work to be done here in San Diego and across the country. The time to act is now. Sign the petition: The federal government must invest in the Green New Deal.\\nSIGN THE PETITION\\nI will always choose to keep fighting for a brighter, greener, more affordable and sustainable community.\\n\\\\-- Georgette Gómez\\nGeorgette Gómez is the first LGBTQ Latina elected San Diego City Council President.

No charges for two of the officers, and charges for the third only on damage to Breonna Taylor’s neighbors’ apartment.\\nJustice has not been served. As we and our ancestors have chanted for years: No justice, no peace.\\nLately, it’s been so difficult to keep our heads up. To have faith in our democracy. And today, it’s painful beyond words to find out that our justice system has shown once again that equal justice under law remains a powerful aspiration -- but not yet a reality for all in our country.\\nThis is why we say #BlackLivesMatter. It’s why we #SayHerName.\\nWe owe it to Breonna Taylor to keep fighting for justice. For her family, friends, and community -- we owe it to them to keep up the fight.\\nCondemning police brutality is not something I will ever be silent about -- that’s why right here in San Diego, I’ve introduced initiatives to move services out of police officer’s job descriptions and into the hands of social workers and to reallocate funding directly into our communities -- especially our Black and brown communities.\\nFor too long, we’ve ignored the bias in our justice system. And Breonna Taylor’s case is one of the many that prove the injustices that exist within our system.\\nSgt. Jonathan Mattingly, Detective Myles Cosgrove, and former detective Brett Hankison murdered Breonna Taylor. That’s exactly how they should be charged -- as murderers.\\nDemanding justice for Black lives is something I’ve never been silent about, and I don’t plan on stopping now.\\nI know this is tough \\\\-- but we can’t allow Breonna’s death to be in vain. We’ve got to continue this fight for her and her family. She deserves justice.\\nBreonna Taylor, say her name.\\nI extend my deepest condolences to Breonna’s family and friends -- and though it will only be cold comfort, police accountability is something I tackled right here in San Diego and is something I’ll tackle on the national level when elected to Congress this November.\\nWishing everyone peace and justice,\\nGeorgette\\nDONATE\\nGeorgette Gómez is the first LGBTQ Latina elected San Diego City Council President.

Donald Trump, instead of backing down from calls to remove these forces, is threatening to send agents to more places.\\nLet me be abundantly clear: I stand in solidarity with the thousands of you who have taken to the streets to demand that our government make meaningful progress in addressing the root causes of police brutality and systemic neglect of communities of color. And Trump needs to remove the federal agents from Portland immediately.\\nThe murder of George Floyd has exposed a crumbling faith in government and mistrust of police that must be addressed immediately -- addressed with substantial, comprehensive reform of our criminal justice system, NOT by “sieging a city” with outside forces that local officials did not ask for.\\nHere in San Diego, I led the city council in taking swift action to fight discrimination by successfully banning police chokeholds and giving the voters a choice to establish an Independent Police Practices Commission to restore trust between communities and police.\\nBuilding trust between communities and law enforcement is just the beginning -- the public should have complete faith in police oversight -- we need to see more police oversight. We need to address the reality that many communities of color have been treated unfairly by police and have nowhere to turn to correct injustice.\\nThe answer is certainly not by forcing secret police into cities -- that's why we're calling on Trump to remove these forces. Add your name to our petition telling Trump to put an end to mobs of secret police.\\nSIGN THE PETITION\\nOur broken criminal justice system is a civil rights issue. We need more community policing, more trust between neighborhoods and police, and real, meaningful, criminal justice reform.

This will make health care affordable for most Americans, while also reducing the cost of legacy programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA.\\n* Criminal Justice Reform: As President, I will use my Constitutional authority to end federal civil asset forfeiture prior to conviction, and pardon persons convicted of non-violent victimless crimes. I will also work with Congress to end the failed War on Drugs and other victimless crimes.\\n* Auditing the Federal Reserve: Our reckless monetary system threatens to destroy the value of the U.S. entirely and must be stopped. As President, I will audit the Federal Reserve and begin shutting down the money printing machine.\\n* Peace: I believe we should turn America into one giant Switzerland -- Armed and Neutral.

Here’s where to sign up to join our texting/calling team:\\n[[URL REDACTED]]\\n\\\\- Events:\\nVolunteers organize, manage, and staff events around the country. More events mean more voters reached.

A Libertarian is competitive in a race for GOVERNOR!\\nRainwater also has more cash on hand than the Democratic challenger and he's running radio and TV ads, unlike the Democrat! Meanwhile...\\n* In Arkansas, Libertarian Ricky Harrington is the sole opponent for Senator Tom Cotton, whose support has fallen below 50%! Get this...\\nHarrington is only 11 percentage points behind Sen. Cotton, with 13% undecided! But it gets better...\\nCotton dodged a scheduled TV debate with Harrington, so Harrington got the stage and the TV screen all to himself for an entire hour!\\nReporters asked him questions and he did an amazing job answering them! The coverage was phenomenal!\\nI’ve been active in the Libertarian Party for forty years, and this is the first time we've had competitive candidates for Governor and the U.S. Senate!

However I\\'d argue that Halloween is the exact opposite and instead a great opportunity for children to participate in a free market.\\n9vWp6ZiszZSjfYNzQ3RYf37FYVvZfSmvCpb2r4DUx1ohhk2GFzwxLRewb3cUN5pjDWzZw4jJuaU66vjxGACrCXQ6pajX5AVjb69TJPvddKfzYBmngvnnTSJRPFEqcjF25Dc3qDYfc63A4RsSe\\nHalloween is one of those holidays that can be enjoyed by any child - regardless of social class. With some hard work and ingenuity a box, a sheet, or any combination of mundane household items can be turned into a clever costume that can be rewarded with one form of payment agreed upon by children around the world; candy. For one night, candy becomes a universal currency paid out to those who showed up and were willing to put in the work of production and marketing.\\nHalloween brings out a healthy competition among children and allows them to experience both product design and marketing. Maybe your costume is not as clever as the other kids in school but you are willing to knock on more doors. Maybe a child is clever enough to target just the homes that give the king size bars or they figured out that people give more candy to emptier looking bags, hiding their haul from view. Whichever tactic is used there is a lesson gained and with each year they participate in an opportunity to engage in those self taught lessons.\\nSome will choose the costume they want, forgoing the candy for self satisfaction - some will choose the costume that pleases their peers, forging candy for social status, others will choose a costume that appeals to the parents, targeting the candy giver.

Indeed, Libertarian values are often misunderstood by Christians in general, who may think libertarianism encourages personal immorality and discourages care for the poor and marginalized. As a pastor in Texas, I run up against these two misunderstandings all the time.\\nIf we Libertarians are going to reach more Christian voters with Jo Jorgensen’s message of freedom, we need to learn to talk about our values in a way that the average Christian will understand and connect with. I don’t have space in this Jorgensen Insider article to discuss both personal morality and care for the poor, so at this time I’ll simply tackle the latter. Below are some thoughts that I hope will help you frame your discussion about liberty with any Christian voters who may come across your path.\\nWhether they realize it or not (and Republican-leaning Christians in particular may not), many Christians support big government out of well-meaning concern for the poor and marginalized. It’s natural for Christians to care about the least, the last, and the lost; it’s built right into the religion. Some will assume that because Libertarians oppose taxation for government programs, Libertarians must not care what happens to the poor and marginalized.\\nIt’s important to assure Christian voters that this isn’t the case. Libertarians do care for the poor. We simply believe that local communities made up of caring individuals know better how to care for their real, flesh-and-blood neighbors than do politicians and bureaucrats in Washington, DC.\\nRepublicans and Democrats want to convince you that the best way to care for your neighbors is to take your tax money to Washington, come up with a one-size-fits-all plan for 330 million people, and then enforce their plan on every American everywhere, whether it actually makes sense for your neighbors or not.\\nThey propose to do this without ever setting foot in your neighborhood. They expect to do it without ever looking the poor and marginalized people of your neighborhood in the eye and asking them what they actually need. Libertarians believe that you and your neighbor know better how to serve one another than do politicians and bureaucrats in Washington.\\nThe even bigger problem with tax-funded, one-size-fits-all, big-government programs intended to remedy poverty and oppression is that these programs convince people like you and me that we’re off the hook for taking care of our own neighbors. Sending off our tax dollars to the government too often makes us Americans—Christians and non-Christians alike—feel like we’ve fulfilled some moral obligation toward the poor without really having to do anything.\\nYou’re busy people, these government programs tell us. Let us figure out how to help the poor. No need for you to actually meet your neighbors. No need for you to look them in the eye and ask them how you can help. No need for you to decide for yourself when to open up your wallet to help with the groceries, or the rent, or to help buy a suit for a job interview. Let us handle it for you. We know better than you.\\nJesus said, “Love your neighbor as yourself.” He didn’t say, “Pay the government and let them love your neighbor for you.” Invite Christian voters to imagine how much of a difference they could make in their actual neighbors’ lives with the money they normally have to send off to Washington.\\nA vote for Libertarian Jo Jorgensen is a vote for an America where Americans are free to love our neighbors ourselves. We don’t need Washington to do that for us.\\n##\\nJoin the Discord!\\nLooking for a great way to celebrate the elections from the comfort of your own home - with the company of some fellow liberty minded voters?!

Discord Link: [[URL REDACTED]]\\n## Why You Should Vote for Dr. Jo Jorgensen, Libertarian Party Candidate for President.\\nBy Les Deffner, State Director, Illinois for Jorgensen-Cohen Campaign\\nThe Libertarian Party (LP) speaks both languages of the liberal left, and the conservative right. We have the best elements of both, and as such we have the greatest position to help bridge the gap between the camps pushing the culture wars to its boiling point. The LP is uniquely qualified to help heal our nation politically and bring back balance and sanity. I am grateful the LP chose Dr. Jorgensen to represent us as our POTUS nominee.\\nPeople tell me “I am honestly not a fan of Trump or Biden; I mean is this really the best this country has as a representation of our potential leadership and the face of the people right now? These two are the best?! It makes me sad and disappointed.\" This problem is a direct result of all the people who have said \"I would vote for the better third party candidate, but they have no chance of winning, so I\\'m going to vote for the lesser of two evils because they \\'at least have a chance\\'.” People kick the can down the road out of fear-based voting, and then wonder why things keep getting worse. They ought to stop and consider how they have contributed to this national problem of our national political culture wars and be painfully honest with themselves.\\nI believe this country is, and always has been greater than the best (and greater than the worst) political candidates. We will survive the 2020 election, but the slide to furthering bitter acrimony and resentments pulling Americans apart, will continue. Neither Trump nor Biden can stop that. A vote for Dr. Jorgensen allows people to save face, retreat to their corners in a form of political time-out, and to cool off.\\nAround 138 million Americans voted in the 2016 presidential election. However, those 138M only make up 58.1% of our voting-eligible population. In 2016, nearly 42% of adults eligible to vote chose not to do so. People do have another choice. If all who are upset at Trump or Biden , or who had chosen to stay home and not-vote in 2016 (and are considering doing the same again in 2020) would vote for Jo Jorgensen, she would win. People need to shake off the fear and apathy that has gripped them and to vote with real courage. Real courage is needed when faced with what seems an impossible task. Just ask any combat soldier.\\nDr. Jo Jorgensen understands that the contest is not about Democrats vs. Republicans. The real fight is between those who support an overbearing government that is filled with fraud, waste, abuse, corruption, and cronyism, and those who choose true liberty, returning the power back to The People: Libertarian candidates.\\nTo restore the political balance and improve the discourse in America is with our votes, and Jorgensen will be on the ballot in all 50 states. The Federal Election Commission considers just 5% of the vote to be significant for their purposes, and most states offer things like ballot access at that 5% mark. This is also part of why we run Presidential Candidates: to improve the chances of our down-ballot candidates. When the LP spends 80 to 90% of our time, money, and effort just to get on the ballot, time to raise money and campaign, or win, becomes extremely hampered. This is by design. This is deliberate disenfranchisement done by the Democrats and Republicans via Ballot Access laws.\\nDemocrats and Republicans have made it clear that their number one priority is to obtain or retain control so they can pass laws to tell other people how to live. Since 1971, the LP has been the most consistent in its platform. Dr. Jorgensen has been part of that effort for 40 years.\\nIt may be cliché, but it is true: my road to libertarianism began around 2005 when I began reading Lockean philosophy. John Locke’s writing was the foundation of Thomas Jefferson’s understanding of government leading to writing the Declaration of Independence and his initial drafts of the Constitution. Additional reading of economists F. A. Hayek and Murray Rothbard, Ayn Rand, and the reasonings of Congressman Ron Paul accelerated my understanding.\\nAs a Navy veteran, it pains me to see my military brothers and sisters returning from Endless Wars, and from unjust deployments that do nothing to keep America safe. I did not serve my country only to return and allow politicians to continue to erode at American’s rights to pursue their life, liberty, and happiness. My vote is with Dr. Jo Jorgensen.\\nLes Deffner is currently serving the cause for Liberty as: State Director, Illinois for Jorgensen-Cohen Campaign; Campaigns Coordinator, Libertarian Party of Illinois; Chairman, Lake County Libertarian Party; State Central Committee Rep, IL 10th District, and Precinct Committeeman.\\n#WhyYouShouldVoteForJoJorgensen\\n## The Halloween Economic Quiz\\nWhat was Adam Smith’s metaphor of what drives individual market participants in a free market economy?\\nThe Invisible Hand\\nWhat is an insolvent thrift which continues to operate?\\nZombie S&L\\'s\\nWhat is a metaphor in game theory which demonstrates conflicts between group goals and individual goals?\\nPrisoners dilemma\\nCandidate George Bush used this description of candidate Ronald Regan’s proposed economic policies in 1980:\\nVoodoo Economics\\nWhat was a tax problem of the late 1970\\'s?\\nBracket Creep\\nWhat determines the autonomous level of business investment according to John Maynard Keynes?\\nAnimal Spirits\\nWhat is the gradual loss of economic freedom to the government?\\nCreeping Socialism\\nWhat was Alan Gleenspan\\'s description of potential economic catastrophes averted during his term as the Fed chairman?\\nAtomic Erosion\\nWhat was Milton Friedman’s metaphor for the destabilizing effects of monetary policy?\\nFool in the Shower\\nWhat is a shipping term which describes a cost borne by the buyer?\\nPhantom Freight\\nPresident Harry s Truman once requested one of these.\\nOne Armed Economist\\nWhat is a stock market term describing a special calendar event?\\nTriple Witching Hour\\nWhat is a Keynesian notion in which workers are fooled by rising nominal wages while real wages actually fall\\nMoney Illusion\\nWhat is a gloomy prophetic motion that population growth will outpace food production?\\nMalthusian Nightmare\\nWhat is a theory of how price and quantity adjust to reach market equilibrium?\\nCobweb Theorem\\nWhat is an unflattering description of complacent US taxpayers?\\nBoiled Frogs\\nEditor In Chief\\nJennifer Imhoff (ID)\\nCopy Editor\\nMark Johnson (ME)\\nManaging Editor\\nLiz Solomon (TX)\\nContributor\\nNick McRae\\nLes Deffner (IL)\\nJennifer Imhoff(ID)\\nPaid by Jo Jorgensen for President.\\nJo Jorgensen for President, 3620 Pelham Rd., #300, Greenville, South Carolina 29615, United States\\nUnsubscribe Manage preferences', 'Answer: Because he is voting for Jo!\\nJo Jorgensen 2020\\nAlex --\\nYou may remember Ken Bone from the 2016 debates.\\nHe was the \"red sweater guy\" who was a famous undecided voter in 2016.

We need price visibility and competition to lower costs.\\nQ: What would you do about COVID-19, shutdowns, and masks?\\nA: I would let businesses decide whether to be open and when, where, and how masks must be worn. Customers could then make their own choices about where to go or not go based on those individual policies.\\nQ: What would you do about a vaccine?\\nA: I won't pretend to be America's pharmacologist in chief. Vaccine providers must do their job, and then individual Americans should be free to decide whether or not to take the resulting vaccines.\\nQ: What would you do about the economy?\\nA: The private sector uses resources better than the government. So I would cut government spending dramatically and put those resources back into the productive economy.\\nQ: What would you do about taxes?\\nA: I will cut taxes as fast as I can. Individual Americans will make better use of the money.\\nQ: What would you do about race relations in America?\\nA: Great Society programs destroyed black families. Then the Nixon administration launched the drug war to further devastate the black community. Then Senator Biden passed a crime bill that placed huge numbers of black men behind bars. I would end the drug war and all the other laws that police use to harass black people.\\nQ: How would you change policing in America?\\nA: I would repeal all victimless crime laws, so police would have fewer reasons to hassle people. I would also outlaw qualified immunity so that police can be held responsible for the consequences of their actions. The result would be fewer dead citizens and fewer dead cops.\\nQ: What would you do about the protests?\\nA: The Democrats and Republicans both use laws to impose things on people against their will. This makes people angry. I would work to repeal all such laws, thereby reducing the anger.\\nQ: Why should voters prefer you?\\nA: I won't use the government to impose things on them against their will. I'll free them to make their own choices provided they respect the equal right of others to do the same.\\nQ: What would you do about forest fires?\\nA: I notice that most wildfires start on public lands. I would try to put more lands in private hands and instruct the Forest Service to emulate what the private sector does to prevent fires.\\nQ: What would you do about global warming?\\nA: Increased use of nuclear power would do more to reduce carbon emissions than any other policy. I would end subsidies that favor other forms of energy, and remove obstacles that block the wider adoption of nuclear power.\\nQ: What do you think about election integrity?\\nA: Election integrity starts by letting all the ballot-qualified candidates appear in the debates.\\nDonate\\nPaid for by Jo Jorgensen for President.\\nJo Jorgensen for President, 3620 Pelham Rd., #300, Greenville, South Carolina 29615, United States\\nUnsubscribe Manage preferences\", 'This week, Americans will have the opportunity to watch Debate Train-wreck 2.0 with Mike Pence and Kamala Harris in the Vice Presidential\\nJo20-Logo\\nAlex,\\nThis week, Americans will have the opportunity to watch Debate Train-wreck 2.0 with Mike Pence and Kamala Harris in the Vice Presidential Debate.\\nMike Pence will serve as a shill for the Trump administration.\\nHe will say anything to defend Trump\\'s terrible record on spending and increasing the debt by TRILLIONS of dollars all while pretending to be a so-called, \"conservative\".\\nKamala Harris will regurgitate everything she learned in debate prep to avoid discussing her horrendous record on criminal justice reform.\\nBiden and Harris are both responsible for locking up THOUSANDS of men and women for victimless crimes and have never apologized or done anything to rectify their mistakes.\\nIn fact, Kamala Harris laughed about smoking pot on a podcast while failing to do anything to help the people hurt by the War on Drugs.\\nMake No Mistake: This is a fake debate and neither Mike Pence nor Kamala Harris will answer for their terrible mistakes.\\nAlex, Jo and I are fighting for REAL criminal justice reform and to pardon those Pence and Harris have locked up for victimless crimes...\\nWe\\'re fighting to cut spending and save our country from financial ruin...\\nWe\\'re fighting to unleash the free market to save our failing healthcare system...\\nAnd we\\'re fighting to bring the troops home...\\nBut we need your help.\\nThe next FEC deadline is actually October 14th.

But another alternative is on every American's ballot... Dr. Jo Jorgensen.\\nThis documentary feature film follows the campaign of Dr. Jorgensen, the first woman to be on all 50 state ballots in 2 Presidential elections.\\n2020 has been a year which will forever live in infamy. The Presidential election has American's baffled at how they found themselves in this horrible situation. Stuck between President Donald Trump and Vice-President Joe Biden, many Americans see the situation as hopeless.\\nThe government by virtue of a global pandemic has forced the shutdown of businesses all over the nation leaving record joblessness, an unstable stock-market and little hope for many Americans.\\nThis film was made as an effort to discover if Dr. Jorgensen is the President we need to make America the land of Liberty for ALL people.\\n398344_550x814\\nFind out more at: [[URL REDACTED]]\\n## Choice Matters\\nby Liz Solomon and TJ Ferreira\\nRoad3\\nWe have all heard of the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD). The CPD, whose ludicrous rule for inclusion in the debates insists that a candidate “have a level of support at least 15% of the national electorate as determined by five national public opinion polling organizations selected by the commission.” This is a ploy by the duopoly to showcase the two major parties and hide third parties from sight of the American public.\\nThe polls used by the commission are:\\n* ABC/Washington Post Poll\\n* CNN Poll\\n* Fox News Poll\\n* NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll\\n* NPR/PBS NewsHour pe\\nHow many of these polls do you think included Dr. Jo Jorgensen, Libertarian candidate for President? Zero. If a candidate is excluded from the “selected polls,” does the commission expect that candidate to achieve the minimum? No, the commission neither expects the candidate to succeed, nor does it care. The CPD wants you to believe that there are only two choices, because they are bipartisan.\\nHowever, Libertarians and other third parties are no longer alone in their frustrations with the CPD. Republicans, Democrats, and independents want to make an informed decision too. Enter, the Committee for American Debate (CAD). Have you heard of it? It is a nonpartisan organization looking to compete with the CPD!\\nThe criteria for qualifying for an invitation to the CAD debates: 1) be Constitutionally eligible to hold the office of the President of the United States, and 2) appear on all 50 state ballots and the District of Columbia ballot. No polls, no nonsense. Dr. Jo Jorgensen, former Vice President Joe Biden, and President Donald Trump are invited to the first debate. Time and date will be determined. Dr. Jorgensen has, of course, accepted the invitation.\\nIn the past, we tried to get into the CPD debates by appealing to the CPD, appealing to the American people, and through lawsuits disputing the partisan nature of the CPD. All of our attempts failed. The difference between our past attempts and this new effort is that we are appealing to the free market. If an organization has a monopoly and is supplying a sub-par service, the best way to break that monopoly is to offer a competing service. The CAD is positioned to compete with the CPD in this election and future elections.\\nTo legitimize the Committee for American Debate please consider signing the petition and following the social media accounts for further updates. You can read more about the CAD and sign the petition on its website.  [[URL REDACTED]]\\n## Life After The Election\\nBy Jennifer Imhoff\\nLet me be the first to admit - My dishes are piling up, my sleep schedule is less predictable than the economy, coffee became a meal, and the camera is off on most Zoom calls these days. I can’t wait for it to end, but I also don’t want it to end. And after talking to a few of my friends in the campaign, I don’t think I’m alone.\\nIt’s easy to get hooked on the fortuity of a presidential campaign. Every day presents a new challenge that can be both intimidating, frustrating, and rewarding. We’ve lost track of the hats we wear and the accomplishments we can use to polish up our resumes. People we’ve never formally met have become daily names in our homes. And we’ve given up on taking notes of the things that woulda, coulda, and shoulda been part of the campaign.\\nFor the last few months many of you have put your loyalty to Jo and Spike above daily tasks. You can’t even go to the grocery store without talking to someone about Jorgensen, leaving a flyer behind, or contemplating how we can target a new audience. But as important as your loyalty to the candidates has been - don’t forget your loyalty to yourself.\\nLike a summer camp romance, we know that November 4th will begin a new era in our lives politically and personally and an end to our sleepless campaigning routines. And right now, it's hard to imagine what life will be like after the election. For some of us, this was our first taste of campaigning, and for others, we are political sommeliers who understand the complexities of the bittersweet taste an election leaves. Regardless of where on that experience spectrum you fall, for many of us, this won’t be our last campaign.\\nIf you think this is your last, November 4th will bring a calm of “at least I tried it.” I encourage you to carry pride, knowing you did what citizens in other countries could only dream of: you exercised your right to democracy and directly worked toward improving the republic. Savor the experience, even if you didn't like the flavor. And if there's one major take away, it's an insider's understanding of just how powerfully money and law influence campaigns.\\nIf this isn’t your last campaign, or at least are open to the idea of another, now is a great time to start networking. Get the phone numbers and email addresses of those whom you enjoyed working with, send a compliment up the ladder for that person who made your job easier, and take a minute to reflect on who was a mentor to your experience. These steps will be critical to your success in future campaigns.\\nNo matter what you do next, you owe it to yourself to start planning. Start to reset your sleep schedule now, and remember to eat a little healthier during this last stretch of the campaign. And note even the smallest wins you’ve made: a new trick in Excel, a new title for your resume, or a new friend you made along the way. That list is longer than you think.\\nAnd for those friends I have made but faces I've never seen, the ones who've been my eyes from the ground at times and eyes from the skyscraper at others - I hope to see them at the election night party so we can re-enact that moment when McClane and Sgt. Powell met for the first time.\\n## VOLUNTEERS NEEDED!\\n## Writers and Content Submissions\\nWe would love to feature your writing in the Jorgensen Insider.

I have to assume that Tori is as pleasant to text with as she is on the phone, which is probably why she is so successful! Since joining the phone bank, Tori has texted nearly 50,000 people on behalf of the Jo Jorgensen for President campaign. This is five times the size of her hometown in Washington! Tori and I talked about her schedule, starting with campaigns on the East Coast and working her way to the West. We talked about the time she gives herself for responding to people who text back. In addition to texting, nearly full-time, as she explains later, she juggles life and a toddler! I asked Tori about her most interesting interaction. She said it was with someone who, after texting back and forth, conceded to check out Jo Jorgensen instead of giving her further push back! Here is Tori, in her own words:\\nLiz: How is it possible to send 40,000 text messages?\\nTori: It takes commitment, for sure, all of my free time is dedicated to getting those texts out. A certain level of passion for what we\\'re doing also really helps. The biggest thing is to not jump in, thinking you\\'ll get those kinds of numbers out right away; it comes after getting to know the system.\\nLiz: What kind of time commitment does it take to send so many messages?\\nTori: It\\'s become a second full-time job, honestly. I thoroughly enjoy doing it, though, so the majority of the time I don\\'t even notice how much time I have spent working on the campaigns. Even if you just do it in your spare time, you\\'ll be able to get thousands of messages out to people.\\nLiz: Do you have special equipment?\\nTori: I use a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse so that I have a bit more mobility when dealing with my son: other than that, no, just a computer and the Internet.\\nLiz: How do you juggle being a full time text volunteer for the Jo Campaign and being a mom?\\nTori: That\\'s what I love about the program! It seriously offers so much flexibility. I\\'m able to text all over the country, which opens up so much time to do it.\\nLiz: What is the best response you\\'ve received from a text message?\\nTori: My all time favorite interactions with people are when they start off completely disinterested. Then you start playing along with them, and it spikes their interest in Jo. It offers a level of satisfaction that maybe, just maybe, I was able to sway that person into voting for someone that actually has the American people in mind.\\nLiz: Do you have a favorite texting campaign?\\nTori: I don\\'t, mostly because you come across so many witty and clever people all over this country. It\\'s hard to pinpoint one area that I\\'ve enjoyed working on more than others.\\nLiz: How do you plan to stay on top of the texting and beat Ryan Cooper?\\nTori: I truly hope someone can beat me, because that means we have reached out to so many people! Healthy competition is great, but my main goal is to work with some amazing people and let people know about the third option that is on our ballots. I\\'m just going to keep what I\\'m doing and keep it at that.\\nTori’s personal goal is to reach 100,000 people by the end of the campaign. Will anyone catch up to Tori? We’re rooting for you, Tori; you can do it! If you’d like to get involved with the text bank, please join us on one of the following Zoom calls listed below:\\nTraining sessions for new users are held every Tuesday and Thursday from 5pm-11pm EDT / 2pm-8pm PDT.\\nTuesday Night TextBank Training:\\n[[URL REDACTED]]\\nMeeting ID: 843 0322 8210 Passcode: 715405\\nThursday Night TextBank Training:\\n[[URL REDACTED]]\\nMeeting ID: 828 4169 8401 Passcode: 299944\\n##\\nWhy “Non-Essential Workers” Need a Libertarian President\\nfrom Genet Jones\\nThere is a sign on the fence of a nearby independent-living complex that says, “To our police, healthcare providers, and other essential workers: THANK YOU!”\\nEvery time I drive by that sign, I feel the urge to add another one next to it that says, “To everyone else: please don’t let anyone tell you that you are not essential.”\\nIf you put food on the table for yourself or your family, you are essential. If you are working your way through your degree or skills training, your work is essential.\\nNo human being deserves to be labeled “non-essential.”\\nBut the entrenched political parties are perfectly happy to label you non-essential. They have made it clear for decades that whatever words they throw around on the podium, when it comes to their actions—the laws and policies they support—they have no problem throwing the average American, and the disadvantaged American, under the bus.\\nRepublican and Democrat governors alike locked down their states and destroyed family businesses with the proverbial stroke of a pen. “Two weeks to flatten the curve” turned into months of lockdown, restrictions, harassment, polarization of health concerns, and massive unemployment.\\nPoliticians at every level favor or even subsidize some industries, penalize others, and protect still others from competition or from liability to consumers. You as a consumer are treated as far less essential than those protected industries. And it doesn’t matter if your business is essential to your family; if it conflicts with the agenda of the best-paying lobbyists, even in a pre-Covid world, you were less than non-essential.\\nBut the libertarian ethos is that everyone is essential. No one is less important than anyone else.\\nYou may have heard this from other political parties, but they do not practice what they preach. On a daily basis, they enact laws and make policies that favor some groups of people over others—not to mention that politicians are the most favored group of all.\\nEach of us is an essential human being with unique talents and personal goals that matter the same as anyone else’s. This is why Libertarians believe that everyone deserves to make their own decisions about risk and reward, have equal protection under the law, and not get their livelihood thrown under the bus by the governor, the mayor, or the health department.\\nA Libertarian president would help to actually end police brutality, making it easier and safer for good police officers to do their jobs, by ending qualified immunity. Police officers are essential. So are the people they are sworn to protect. The way we respect both these truths is to make sure that those few police officers who don’t respect the value of life are never again allowed to represent the law. Getting rid of laws that protect them from prosecution is the only way to begin making that happen.\\nA Libertarian president would end the war on drugs, releasing millions of victimless “offenders” to live their essential lives with their families and communities, and opening up the growing marijuana industry to thousands of businesses and workers.\\nA Libertarian president would bring our troops home from entanglements all over the world, recognizing that those men and women are essential to their families, and essential for protecting our country, but not for policing the world. The Libertarian perspective that every person is essential makes it clear that sending our troops around the globe to intimidate the rest of the world is not only wasting the lives of our troops but also making all Americans less safe at home by virtue of our leaders making enemies abroad.\\nWhether you are serving your community as an “essential worker” or one who has been labeled “non-essential,” remember that if the government has the power today to label your neighbors non-essential and take away their means to live, then tomorrow it has the power to do that to you—unless we make a real change.\\nA Libertarian vote in 2020 is a vote to protect the essential in every one of us.\\n## The Ball Is Still in Play…\\nBy Kevin Moore\\nThere are many ways that volunteers can still help between now and the election!\\nHere are a few:\\nCommittee for American Debate\\nThe non-partisan Committee for American Debate wants Jo Jorgensen on the debate stage!

They are firmly rooted, deep in our souls. They cannot be contested and therefore do not need to be changed. They are also recognized by lovers of liberty, even when they are presented for the first time.\\nI reflected recently upon the presidential campaign of 1980. I was 16 years old—not yet old enough to vote—yet I clearly remember being captivated by the Ed Clark for President television advertisements. This was my first exposure to the Libertarian Party, and I was profoundly attracted to the truths of liberty that were explained in those messages.\\nIn my senior year of high school, 1981-1982, the ladies from the League of Women Voters (LWV) came to our campus to register students to vote. I was sure to take advantage of the opportunity. Everything was recorded on paper back then, and a lady from the LWV started asking me questions and recording my answers: name, date of birth, address, etc. When she got to the box for ‘party’, her question was “Republican or Democrat?” to which I responded, “Libertarian.” Her response was a blank stare; she simply didn’t know what to do. She proceeded to ask some of the other LWV representatives, and finally one knew the answer. I’ve been resistant to being restricted to two choices ever since that initial experience.\\nEd Clark spoke of people, not government, knowing what is best for them. People can solve problems in an “intelligent, benevolent, and voluntary manner.” His goal, and the Libertarian Party’s goal, in 1980 was liberty and curtailing government’s involvement in our lives. That flame was ignited in me then, and it again burns strong in me with the opportunity to elect Jo Jorgensen and Spike Cohen, who embody these principles, these truths which are, after 40 years, still unchanged. There has been one important change, though: we need to act on these truths more than ever.\\n## Exponential Growth\\nby Joey Marra\\nDid you know…\\n7.5 million more people voted in the 2016 presidential election than in the 2012 election. That’s nearly a 6% increase!\\nWith 7.5 million more votes, the R and D parties saw a combined overall increase of roughly 1.9 million votes, while the Libertarian party saw an overall increase of OVER 3.2 MILLION VOTES – nearly half of the added votes!\\nPut another way, from 2012 to 2016, the R and D parties experienced a less than 2% increase in their combined support at the polls. The Libertarian party experienced a 252% increase in their support at the polls. 252%!\\nBy supporting Dr. Jo Jorgensen, you aren’t wasting your vote like the old parties would have you believe. Instead, in this political tug-of-war, you are deciding to stop pulling for the status quo and join the massively growing group pulling against it on the other side. Pulling for something better.\\nThe momentum is undeniable. YOU can be a part of the growth that ultimately leads to better candidates, better choices, and better lives. The longer we wait, the worse things get in the meantime. Millions are figuring that out and supporting change in our lifetime.

We were concerned when he told us that he wasn\\'t feeling well and shocked when we heard that he had passed away. Ryan was an extremely passionate advocate for liberty and he will be missed by all of us.”\\n~ David Naranjo, Chair, Libertarian Party of Orange County & County Coordinator, OC for Jorgensen\\n\"Although I did not know Ryan long, what I do remember from the times we met was that his energy was very up lifting. He was a joy to be around and made me feel like I was in the presence of a friend that I had known forever.

Libertarians know that the only “wasted vote” is for more of the same, but ranked-choice voting makes the concept of the wasted vote disappear.\\nIn Maine, we now don’t simply vote. We rank order our choices for each elected position. Therefore, those who really are encouraged by Dr. Jo’s message, but are discouraged that they might not get their lesser-of-two-evils choice by voting for Dr. Jo, no longer need to be concerned.\\nHere’s a quick summary of how this works. There are five candidates on Maine’s presidential election ballot: Biden, de la Fuente, Hawkins, Jorgensen, Trump. Everyone who supports Dr. Jo can “rank” her #1. If my preferred lesser-of-two evils candidate is Biden, I just need to be sure I rank him higher than Trump, or vice versa, and if Hawkins, de la Fuente, and Jorgensen all get eliminated, one by one, by finishing last in each of the first three rounds, my vote would still go to my preferred lesser-of-two-evils candidate.\\nLet’s look at some scenarios. For these scenarios, let’s assume that 43% of Maine voters favor Jorgensen, but because they’ve been conditioned by a two-party system, only 28% of Maine voters would have voted for her under traditional balloting. In a five-way race under traditional balloting, 43% should be enough to win, but 28% would not be enough. Of the 15% who would not have voted for Jorgensen, let’s say that 80% of those, or 12% of the entire electorate, favor Trump.\\nScenario 1:\\n* The 43% who favor Jorgensen rank her #1.\\n* The other first place rankings are as follows: Trump 27%, Biden 22%, de la Fuente 6%, Hawkins 2%.\\n* Those who ranked Hawkins first all ranked Biden as their second choice.\\n* After the first tally, no one has 50% of the vote, so the candidate with the fewest first-place rankings, Hawkins, is eliminated, and those votes now go to Biden. So we now have: Jorgensen 43%, Trump 27%, Biden 24%, de la Fuente 6%.\\n* Still, no one has 50% of the vote, so de la Fuente is eliminated. Those who ranked him first split their second place votes between Jorgensen and Trump, each receiving 3%. The tally is now Jorgensen 46%, Trump 30%, Biden 24%.\\n* Still, no one has 50% of the note, so Biden is eliminated. Those who ranked him first all ranked Hawkins as their second choice, but Hawkins has been eliminated, so their third-ranked choices are evaluated. Of those, three-fourths chose Trump and the remainder chose Jorgensen, so Trump gets another 18% (three-fourths of 24%) and Jorgensen gets 6%.\\n* Jorgensen now has 52% and Trump has 48%. Jorgensen exceeds 50% and wins!\\nScenario 2:\\n* Only the 28% portion of those who truly favor Jorgensen rank her #1. The rest rank Trump #1.\\n* Keeping the rest of the candidates’ rankings the same, the first tally is now Trump 42%, Jorgensen 28%, Biden 22%, de la Fuente 6%, Hawkins 2%.\\n* All those who ranked Trump and de la Fuente first ranked Jorgensen second. All those who ranked Hawkins first ranked Biden second.\\n* After the first tally, Hawkins is eliminated, and the new totals are Trump 42%, Jorgensen 28%, Biden 24%, de la Fuente 6%.\\n* After the second tally, de la Fuente is eliminated, and with those second place rankings split between Trump and Jorgensen, the new totals are Trump 45%, Jorgensen 31%, Biden 24%.\\n* Biden is now eliminated. Following the rankings above of those who ranked Biden first, Trump gets 18% and Jorgensen gets 6%.\\n* Trump how has 63% and Jorgensen has 37%. Trump exceeds 50% and wins.\\nWhile I’ve done my best to provide some simplified scenarios, the process is still complex due to the possible permutations, made even more complex by voters who may only make one or two choices. That said, there are two takeaways that are amazingly simple: Getting voters to rank Jorgensen first and either Biden or Trump second, rather than the other way around, has a profound effect on the final outcome. If the liberty-loving voters of Maine rank Jorgensen, and not the lesser of two evils, as their first choice, she would coast to victory!\\n## An Interesting History of Presidential Debates\\nBy Joey Marra\\n1972\\nA new FCC ruling extends “equal time” provisions to presidential debates. As a matter of practicality, this largely necessitates presidential debates be hosted by a neutral third-party.\\n1976\\nThe nonpartisan League of Women Voters (LWV) steps in to be that neutral party and to ultimately host the first televised presidential debate in nearly twenty years. They go on to host debates through 1984 with the goal of informing the American voter via a nonpartisan platform utilizing lively debate formats and inclusion of third-party and independent candidates.\\n1980\\nIn opposition to their inclusion of an independent candidate, President Carter declines the LWV’s invitation to the second debate of the year. Despite the lack of appearance by the sitting president, true to its principles, the LWV goes on with the debate, honoring their invitations to Ronald Reagan and independent candidate, John Anderson. Jimmy Carter goes on to lose the election to Ronald Reagan, with Carter’s absence at the debate noted as a major factor in Reagan’s success. The Democratic and Republican parties get their first taste of the influence of the relatively new, neutrally hosted, televised debates. It is also apparent that the presence of an independent candidate is what kept the debate alive, even when a sitting president chose to opt out. Simply declining to participate is not a viable option.\\n1984\\nThe Democratic and Republican parties begin to work together to remove risk from the LWV’s debates by jointly vetoing nearly 100 panelists proposed by the LWV for the ‘84 debates.\\n1987\\nThe non-profit Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) is formed with the intent of taking control of the presidential debates. It is formed by the two heads of the Democratic and Republican parties, chaired by those same two men, and is staffed by members of both parties. At the time, one of the founders stated that the new CPD was not likely to look with favor on including third-party candidates in the debates, while the other stated plainly that the panel should exclude them. Despite its formation, founding members, staffing, and the statements of its founders, the CPD describes itself as “nonpartisan” to this day.\\n1988\\nIn an attempt to wrangle control from the LWV, the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns meet without the knowledge of the LWV to draft a “memorandum of understanding” outlining their requirements for participation in the 1988 debates. This document removes all control from the LWV. It specifies who would be panelists, who could sit in the audience, removed follow-up questions from the format, and more. It is presented to the LWV as “take it or leave it.” The LWV loudly “leaves it,” stating that “the demands of the two campaign organizations would perpetrate a fraud on the American voter.” Upon resignation of the LWV, the months-old D&R-formed CPD steps in to take over the debates as their “nonpartisan” sponsor and host.\\n1992\\nRoss Perot, then polling at 7%, is included in the CPD’s debates. After what is largely considered impressive debate performances, Ross Perot goes on to receive 19% of the popular vote on election day. This is considered to be a remarkable achievement and the largest post-debate increase ever seen.\\n1996\\nAlthough in the running again and on the ballot in all 50 states, the CPD does not invite Ross Perot to the 1996 debates.\\n2000\\nThe CPD establishes a rule that, in order to be included in the debates, a candidate must achieve an average of 15% in five national polls. Although sounding somewhat reasonable on the surface, there are major criticisms of this rule: (1) The CPD alone chooses which polls will be used each election cycle. (2) The polls are routinely chosen only after they have published their polling results. (3) Nearly all polls used do not mention the names of any candidates other than those of the Democratic and Republican parties. That is, in order to meet the CPD’s criteria, a third-party candidate must average 15% in polls where their name is not even mentioned and where the CPD already knows the results.\\n1996 – 2020\\nDespite multiple candidates appearing on the ballots in all 50 states, no third-party nor independent candidates are invited to a CPD debate. Ross Perot’s appearance in 1992 is the last.\\nMultiple lawsuits are brought against the CPD for various reasons including violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act, violation of Federal Antitrust Laws, and challenges to its non-profit status. Thus far, none of these lawsuits have been successful.\\nToday\\nWe’ve been cheated. For over three decades, the Democratic and Republican parties have effectively worked together to limit the choices of the American voter while failing to work together in Congress on issues such as the national debt, our nation’s security, and much more. They are showing us where their priorities lie.\\nNot only are they actively silencing the voices of viable candidates and stifling the competition of ideas that benefits us all regardless of political affiliation, they also continue to perpetuate the lie that voting outside of their chosen candidates is a “wasted vote.” This implies that prioritizing your values and supporting a candidate that you feel could better help the nation is somehow a waste. Just like the curated debates, this is simply another dishonest campaign tool with the goal of concentrating attention and support where actively funnel it. Those of us disappointed and disenfranchised by the Democrats and Republicans make up the VAST MAJORITY of voters – mathematically, the two parties simply can’t beat the numbers, so instead they deceive and mislead. Or, as the LWV warned us decades ago, they knowingly “perpetrate a fraud on the American voter.”\\nThirty years later, it’s the same as it ever was. Despite the majority of Americans routinely expressing the need for more party options, despite more and more Americans not identifying as either Republican or Democrat, despite being on the ballot in all 50 states, and despite the majority of Americans agreeing with 60-70% of her platform, Libertarian candidate Dr. Jo Jorgensen is not named in any of the five polls chosen by the CPD for debate inclusion and has not been invited to the CPD’s 2020 presidential debates.\\nYOU can do the work, though. YOU don’t have to approach this election wearing the blinders that the old parties have handed you. Research Dr. Jorgensen. Read her platform. Watch her videos. See if her ideas resonate with you; then talk to your friends and family and let them know that there is a better way. We all deserve better. Demand better. Be part of the growing momentum that ultimately rids us of the ever-worsening status quo and leads us to better candidates, better choices, and better lives.\\nLearn more at:\\n[[URL REDACTED]]\\n[[URL REDACTED]]\\n## What Is A Media Monitor?\\nby Chelsea K. Meckel, M.A.\\nOver the past few years the Libertarian Party has had more than its fair share of gaffes, and it seems like when those happen it is one of the few times the media decides to unite and put us in the spotlight. In 2016, journalists from the Washington Times to the BBC in the United Kingdom covered Gary Johnson’s famous “What’s Aleppo?” moment. Thankfully, we Libertarians are capable of learning from our mistakes, and the Media Monitoring Team with the Jo Jorgensen for United States President is busy monitoring both Dr. Jorgensen’s presence in the media, as well as working hard to keep her up-to-date with any current events both here in America, and around the world.\\nThe Media Monitoring team is broken down into two parts. First, there is a group of volunteers working hard to keep up with Dr. Jorgensen’s presence in the media. Above all, campaigns are acts of communication, and the first step in any successful communication attempt is to understand your audience. On this team, members of the audience go through and pull quotes, videos, and audio they think help present Dr. Jorgensen in a favorable light. These are then used in promotional materials by the campaign. Understanding that not all communication is good communication, this team also checks for possible faux pas where Dr. Jorgensen could have possibly used better communication strategies to reach her audience.\\nThe other part of the Media Monitoring team focuses on keeping Dr. Jorgensen up-to-date with current events. Candidates are busy, and do not always have the time in their busy schedule to read through dozens of news articles to see what is happening in both America and around the world. That is where this team comes in. Every day volunteers review a variety of newspapers to see what the people from both sides of the political divide find important. This way, Dr. Jorgensen is prepared to address these needs in her constituency on the campaign trail.\\nWith the Media Monitoring on the lookout, hopefully Dr. Jorgensen can be not only an excellent representation of the Libertarian Party, but hopefully by keeping her up-to-date on current events, we can avoid another “What’s Aleppo?” moment and have one of the most informed candidates on the stage to present to the American people. Since Libertarians are one of the lesser known political parties, even though we have achieved ballot access for Dr. Jorgensen in all 50 states, we seem to be held to higher standards than the other candidates from the major parties. We have got to do more to win people’s votes. Therefore, it is important to present an informed, intelligent candidate, with excellent communication skills to head our ticket.\\n## VOLUNTEERS NEEDED!\\n## Media Monitors - Multiple\\nDo you like to watch the news?

Most of us have heard about “phone banking.” Phone banking has been around for decades; calling volunteers, donors, and voters is nothing new. But, have you heard of “text banking”? I had an opportunity to catch up with Ryan Cooper from Washington this week. He and a group of volunteers are texting for the Jorgensen campaign.\\nL: Ryan, tell me, what is a “texting” party?\\nR: A texting party is where a group of us in the same time zone (Pacific) get together on Zoom and chat with each other while we send text messages to voters using the Jorgensen Call Hub platform. We find that it\\'s more fun doing it as a group than individually. We can ask questions, get help using the system, and have a blast while doing it.\\nL: Was the event virtual or did you meet somewhere in person?\\nR: We did it virtually for two reasons. One, Covid, and the forest fires. Meeting together is a challenge already. The forest fires on the West Coast make breathing outside difficult. It just makes sense to get together on Zoom and have a virtual Text Bank Party.\\nL: How long was the event?\\nR: The event was from 5-8, but people stayed on until 9pm, which is the Call Hub cutoff for sending messages. We encourage everyone to try to tie up loose conversation threads before logging off so that you don\\'t leave anyone hanging.\\nL: How did you come up with this idea?\\nR: Ron Paul\\'s campaign did similar texting and phone banking operations in 2008 and 2012. Volunteers would meet up at a nearby Subway. Whoever sent the most messages won a free $5 footlong. Those who couldn\\'t attend could participate over Skype. This is the next evolution in the Ron Paul Revolution.\\nL: Was the event a success?\\nR: Huge success. Going into it, you are never sure how many people will show up. We had 15, which is not bad for our first one. Those volunteers sent over 8000 messages, had over 1000 conversations. The Jorgensen campaign added a bunch of new volunteers and raised over $500 just from our efforts.\\nL: Would you do it again?\\nR: We are doing it every Tuesday night 5-8:30 PM Pacific. On election night, we are hosting a virtual zoom party for all of our volunteers. Our goal next week is 50 volunteers from across CA, OR, NV, AZ, WA, and Northern Idaho (Pacific Time Zone) and 50,000 sent messages. We are hoping to get Spike and Jo on future West Coast Text Banker Tuesday Zooms.\\nL: Is there anything you would like to add?\\nR: West Coast Text Bankers 4 Jorgensen is issuing a \"Time Zone Challenge\" to the Mountain, Central, and Eastern Time Zone Jorgensen supporters. Whichever Time Zone Team has the most volunteers and sends the most text messages on a specific Zoom event evening will win a prize or some kind of recognition. We will be offering some swag and incentives to people who want to join our West Coast Text Banker Team.

They believe the system is rigged and that there’s no chance of getting the kind of candidate they’d want to see in office elected.\\nDr. Jo Jorgensen, the Libertarian candidate for president, has a message for such voters.\\n“Washington, D.C. wants you demoralized,” said Jorgensen. “They don’t want you to vote because they need you to stay home in order for their status quo candidates to win.”\\n“Refusing to vote feeds right into their hands,” she added. “It doubles the impact of the voters who do, and it keeps career politicians, cronies, and special interests in power.”\\n“But you actually have much more influence over the system than you realize,” she said. “Enough, in fact, to turn the establishment on its head.”\\nIn 2016, 102 million Americans were eligible to vote, but stayed home. Meanwhile, Donald Trump won the election for president with just 63 million votes.\\n“Americans who sit out elections hold an overwhelming majority in this country,” notes Jorgensen. “If just two-thirds of them voted, we could bring down the powers that be in Washington, D.C.”\\n“With a large turnout of anti-establishment voters, those who already vote but who have settled for the ‘lesser of two evils’ would vote their conscience instead. They’d join forces with you to bring in real outsiders,” she said.\\n“Don’t let media blackouts, manipulative polling, and fake debates trick you into believing you don’t have a choice,” she said. “You most definitely do have a real choice, and a chance for real change.”\\nLibertarian Jo Jorgensen is on every ballot in America this election — all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia.\\n“If you know the two-party system is broken and doesn’t serve your family’s needs, please vote for me this election,” she said.\\nDr. Jorgensen advocates lowering health-care costs dramatically by way of free-market competition, bringing our troops home from endless foreign wars, allowing wage-earners to opt out of paying the Social Security (FICA) tax, and ending the failed and destructive War on Drugs.\\nHer campaign gives voters a viable alternative to Donald Trump and Joe Biden, who are the only other presidential choices appearing on every ballot.\\nThis year marks the fifth time the Libertarian Party has succeeded in placing its presidential ticket on the ballot in all fifty states, having done so previously in 1980, 1992, 1996, and 2016.\\n“There’s no such thing as not voting,” said Jorgensen. “If they get you to stay home, you’re ‘voting’ for your opponents to win. If you want a different outcome, do something different.\\n“You hold the power to change everything.

Joe Biden has spent his entire life racking up the national debt and was a key player in building the drug war into the disaster it is today.\\nDonald Trump? He ran for President promising to get rid of the debt entirely... and has proceeded to hit a new record of $26 trillion. And he has certainly made no effort to end the war on drugs either.\\nAlex, it makes me proud to serve on Jo's campaign knowing she is a candidate who represents REAL change. Once Jo Jorgensen is in office, the drug war will be put to an end, non-violent criminals will be pardoned, and Jo will veto any bills that add a penny more to our debt.\\nLastly, Jo wanted me to express how grateful she is for the outpouring of support she is receiving. We are on pace to make history as the biggest Libertarian presidential campaign ever and YOU are a part of the accomplishment.\\nAmericans are waking up and desperately want an alternative to Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\\nThank you for everything.\\nSteve Dasbach\\nCampaign Manager\\nP.S.

Wade.”\\nExcept we do know. There’s a reason why so many pro-life Republicans and anti-abortion groups have supported Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Barrett’s track record strongly suggests that she’ll strike down Roe v. Wade the first chance she gets \\\\-- which could be quite soon, contrary to Trump’s debate-stage lies that “it’s not on the ballot” and “there’s nothing happening there.”\\nTrump and the other pro-life GOPers don’t have the majority of Americans on their side. A new NBC News poll shows that sixty-six percent of adults don’t support Roe v. Wade being overturned by the Supreme Court. And we know this issue matters to Democrats since the data also shows that 86% of adult Dems oppose the idea. We have the ability to win if Democrats show up and vote like their bodily autonomy and lives depend on it \\\\-- which they should, because they do.\\nBut the GOP knows their foundation is cracking, so they’re working day and night to push Barrett through before the election to keep Trump in power.
