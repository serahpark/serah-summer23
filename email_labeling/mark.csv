SUPREME COURT RULING: Donald J. Trump Must Release His Tax Returns
'US Supreme Court rules Trump must turn over financial records' - Al Jazeera
100,000 URGENT SIGNATURES NEEDED TO FORCE DONALD J. TRUMP TO COMPLY WITH THE SUPREME COURT AND RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS >>
I, ALEX BROWN, DEMAND TRUMP RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS >>
This petition is registered to [[EMAIL_REDACTED]]. Your signature is required before 11:59PM. Failure to sign could result in Trump getting off the hook for his crimes.
Alex -- It’s happening.
The Supreme Court ruled Donald Trump MUST hand over his taxes. Once his crimes are exposed, Trump will LOSE his bid for the White House!!
So Trump’s corrupt lawyers are fighting to tooth and nail to COVER-UP his tax returns.
They’re ignoring the Supreme Court. It’s OUTRIGHT corruption!!
If we collect 100,000 signatures DEMANDING Trump’s tax returns → we can expose Trump for the FRAUD and LIAR that he is!
But that means we need your signature before midnight. Without your signature, Trump will go totally FREE. Can you SIGN NOW? We still need [7] signatures from 43620 to meet our goal! >>

# Ward condemns Gosar statement
On 18 June, Anne Marie Ward condemned Paul Gosar’s recent attack on law enforcement. Gosar was quoted in the Payson Roundup as saying that, “[t]he police in this country have lost the support of millions of Americans who do not trust their judgment. From the murder of Mr. Floyd to harassing suburban moms in a park, or old people on a beach, law enforcement has created a trust problem for themselves.”
Anne Marie sharply criticized Gosar’s statement. “Paul should apologize to his constituents and to all law enforcement officers in Arizona. This is totally inappropriate for a member of Congress to say in ANY context. Unlike my opponent, I fully support our brave police officers. AZ04 loves our men and women in blue (Paul, you might know this if you actually lived in the district you pretend to represent)!”
Ward has distinguished herself from Gosar in her strong support of law enforcement, pointing to Gosar’s votes against 9/11 first responders and against making it a federal crime to commit a targeted attack on law enforcement.
Ward has been a vocal supporter of law enforcement. On 13 June, she posted a photo on social media that was widely shared across the district, expressing her support of police officers. Three days later, a campaign sign of hers was vandalized with the acronym, “ACAB” (All Cops are Bastards). Ward responded on social media by again offering her full support to law enforcement and by calling for civility. She posted on 17 June: “We cannot make positive change in this country by using hateful and derogatory language, whether racially driven or by the profession which someone pursues ... there is far more that unites us in this country than divides us. We can no longer allow career politicians to use tragedies like this to break our nation into rivaling factions for their own political gain.”
In light of Gosar’s critical statement on law enforcement, Ward further stated on 18 June: “Paul Gosar’s comment lumps the entire profession of law enforcement into a category of bad actors who do not deserve our trust. I can’t overstate how damaging this is. We deserve better from our representative.” The primary faceoff between Ward and Gosar — who resides outside the district — is on Aug. 4, 2020.
Anne Marie Ward is a Republican candidate for U.S. Congress in AZ-04.

Thank you for supporting Brady PAC today! We’re working to pass meaningful, life-saving legislation to END the scourge of gun violence across America.
We have a comprehensive plan to elect gun reform champions and end the bloodshed. But no one is going to change our laws for us. If we sit idly by, the corporate gun lobby will keep its fatal grip on power, and we’ll continue to lose lives to senseless violence. So we’re turning to you for your help to save lives before it’s too late. Will you do your part and donate?
DONATE TO PASS REAL GUN SAFETY REFORM >>
The NRA couldn’t care less about the lives we lose every day to gun violence. They’ll do whatever it takes to keep themselves in power -- no matter the human cost.
We know we send you a lot of emails, Alex. But we can’t fight back against the NRA without help from thousands of grassroots activists. We don’t take checks from shady lobbyists -- instead, we rely on a grassroots army of gun safety activists from across the nation to fund our campaign. We simply can’t do our work without you.

Four years ago, Wisconsin gambled on Donald [[URL REDACTED]] and we lost.
Bad numbers
Boy was that a bust! But even as the odds of a second Trump term continue to dwindle, a new Supreme Court decision to throw out mail ballots in Wisconsin that are postmarked by Election Day but arrive after November 3rd, makes it clear that although a Joe Biden victory is not guaranteed, collusion and cheating by Donald Trump, his Republican lapdogs, and now the illegitimate US Supreme Court, is. Will you help me stop it by helping me GET OUT THE VOTE IN WISCONSIN?
Contribute
We cannot place the same bet again.
A vote for Trump is a lot like playing the lottery. Your odds of winning are low, but your odds of losing are high. Play Trump’s numbers and see where that gets us:
226,000 \- The amount of Americans dead so far due to COVID-19
26 -The amount of women who have accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct
5,500 -The number of children separated from their parents at the US/Mexican border
7.9% \- The US jobless rate in September
8 \- The number of Trump associates arrested or convicted of crimes
$750 \- The amount of taxes Trump paid in 2016 and 2017
Donald Trump has gambled away people’s lives and livelihoods to enrich himself and to serve his personal and financial interests his entire life. And he’s played with house money to do so.
In a few days, we have a chance to reshuffle the deck and deal ourselves a winning hand with a Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ticket. But it doesn’t just stop at the Presidential race. To #WINsconsin, we have to max bet on BLUE and vote for every Democrat in every race, everywhere.

If we don’t play our cards right this time, we could be facing another four years of bad bets and HUGE losses. And the American people aint playing this time.

Alex,
In the 50 days since Albany Democrats’ new Cashless Bail law has been in effect, an unprecedented number criminals have been instantly released back into our communities to commit more crimes.
Just last weekend in NYC, a thief thanked Democrats for releasing him after his 139th arrest saying, “Bail reform, it’s lit!... It’s the Democrats! The Democrats know me and the Republicans fear me. You can’t touch me! I can’t be stopped!”
This man had previously received several stints in prison and committed 6 felonies, 87 misdemeanors, and had 21 court hearings.
Alex, cashless bail does not need tiny changes... it needs a full repeal ASAP. Do you agree? Let Lee know here >>>
Instead of handcuffing criminals, Democrats are handcuffing Lady Justice, but I want to know where YOU stand, Alex.
Do you support the new Cashless Bail law?
COMPLETE SURVEY HERE
I want to know what you think of this law that puts our communities at risk. Share your thoughts and take our one-question survey>>>>

Senator Kamala Harris joins The Sip tomorrow at 5:00 pm ET—you don’t want to miss this!
Senator Harris is one of our most passionate and outspoken champions for racial equality and police reform. Earlier this month she, along with Senator Cory Booker, co-sponsored common sense legislation to make lynching a federal crime.
That bill was held from passage by unanimous consent in the Senate, but Senator Harris didn’t let that slow her down. She is currently engaged in a legislative battle to ensure that any police reform legislation that passes in the Senate is robust enough to meet the needs of communities of color across the country.
* #TheSipHour TOMORROW at 5:00pm ET with special guests:
*       * Glynda C. Carr, President & CEO, Higher Heights
* Tracy Sturdivant, President, The League
* Adrianne Shropshire, Founder, Black PAC
* Judith Browne Dianis, Executive Director, Advancement Project National Office
* Fatima Goss Graves, President & CEO, National Women's Law Center
* Senator Kamala Harris
View The Sip Hour, Friday at 5 PM ET Here
This is a very special conversation you don’t want to miss! Senator Harris is a lifelong public safety and civil rights leader. She is the second Black woman in history to be elected to the U.S. Senate, the first Black person and first woman to serve as Attorney General of the state of California, and the third Black woman to ever run for the President of the United States of America.
Grab a drink tomorrow and let’s toast to breaking down barriers and fighting the good fight!

We need 100,000 Democrats to stand with Biden and Harris NOW and demand justice for Jacob Blake. Sign your name →
I DEMAND JUSTICE. ADD MY NAME ➞
Jacob Blake is innocent. But that didn’t stop Kenosha police officers from shooting him 7 times in the back for no reason.
But the officers who shot Blake, leaving him paralyzed for life, still haven’t been charged with any crime -- it’s unbelievable.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are DEMANDING the officer who shot Blake be charged and held accountable for his crime, and they need EVERY good Democrat standing with them to call for IMMEDIATE justice.
Biden and Harris need 100,000 activists to sign on TODAY. Justice cannot wait. Sign your name now →
I DEMAND JUSTICE. ADD MY NAME ➞
Justice must be served.
Jacob Blake was shot in front of his three small children. He spent the following days in the hospital fighting for his life. He’s paralyzed.
“Dismantling systemic racism starts with demanding justice and holding offenders accountable. Based on what I've seen, it seems the officer should be charged.”
Kamala Harris
Jacob Blake is innocent. But his innocence couldn’t protect him from the horrors of police brutality. Just like it couldn’t protect George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and countless more.
What makes this all even worse is that Kenosha cops were seen cozying up to white supremacists in the ensuing protests. Their racism runs deep.
So we’re standing with Biden and Harris to DEMAND the officer who shot Blake be charged.
Biden and Harris need every Good Democrat standing with them to DEMAND justice for Jacob Blake. Sign on to demand the officer who shot Blake be charged →
I DEMAND JUSTICE. ADD MY NAME ➞
Black Americans deserve the right to get into their own car, free from harm.
This is an injustice that cannot be ignored. And it will take an army of grassroots activists like you to finally be taken seriously.

7,"Friend:
This afternoon, we were informed of our state’s fourth COVID-19 death, the second COVID-19 death in Chicago. As a state, we mourn the loss of our fellow Illinoisans -- and we commit to one another that we will take the necessary steps to prevent further spread of this virus.
Sadly, even with the measures our state and city have taken, COVID-19 will claim many more Illinoisans’ lives before things get better. At the moment we have 212 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the City of Chicago, and 585 in Illinois. With limited testing capabilities, the total number of cases is likely many more.
That is why today Governor Pritzker took the necessary and important step of issuing a “Stay At Home” Executive Order.
* The order stipulates that only businesses and operations deemed essential can remain open. Read the list of essential businesses by clicking here. All other business operations must cease or allow their employees to work from home. This order is in place through April 7, but may be extended.
* Under this order, local restaurants for consumption off-premises are ""essential businesses."" Local restaurants can remain open as long as they only serve food off-premises, via delivery, drive-through, curbside pick-up, or carry out. Please consider supporting one of our local restaurants this weekend.
* Under this order, you can still walk your dog, roads are still open, you can go to the grocery store or gas station, you can call a plumber to have them come fix your shower - but Governor Pritzker's order is clear: if it’s not essential the order means STAY HOME, practice social distancing and help save lives.
As Governor Pritzker said today, he knows this order will not be without consequences. He was tasked with saving jobs or saving lives. He chose to save lives. To all my fellow Chicagoans that are rightfully anxious and concerned right now - know that your state and city are with you. I know that Governor Pritzker, Mayor Lightfoot, and our 35th Ward team are working hard everyday to mitigate this public health disaster and the ramifications to come.
You may have already lost your job. You may be at risk of losing your job soon. I am following the conversation in Washington, DC closely - working families desperately need relief from the federal government. But I am not waiting for the federal government to act, that is why I am joining with my progressive colleagues to work on an emergency fund to support working people impacted by this pandemic and ensuing recession. I am also joining with my colleagues and community groups to demand a rent freeze, mortgage free, utility freeze, and other important measures to protect our working families during this time.
And I have put my ward office employees to work, building out a plan to ensure vital city services continue to be delivered, and that we are using our ward office resources, administrative and legislative power to support our working families. As a ward office we have resolved to do everything we can to ensure the health security, economic security, and community security of our residents. To that end, we are launching, alongside the office of 33rd Ward Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez, a mutual aid network that will help our most vulnerable residents in our neighborhoods of Albany Park, Irving Park, Avondale, Logan Square, and Hermosa. If you are in need at this time, please let me know. My team and I are here to help. If you are able to help out a neighbor, please let us know. You can sign up to volunteer with our mutual aid network at: [[URL REDACTED]]
We are all in this together. I know that we can rise to the occasion and ensure that we overcome the challenges thrown at us by this pandemic and recession. As always, do not hesitate to reach out.
In solidarity, Carlos
Carlos Ramirez-Rosa
35th Ward Alderman, City of Chicago

Ald. Ramirez-Rosa applauds our state and county leaders for these important measures to protect our working families. Many of these actions are actions that he and his progressive colleagues called for in order to help prevent further community spread of COVID-19.
* * *
## 35TH WARD CORONAVIRUS UPDATES
To further protect our community from the spread of COVID-19, Ald. Ramirez-Rosa has taken the following measures in the 35th Ward:
* The 35th Ward Office is no longer accepting walk-in visitors. This closure of the office to walk-ins is to promote social distancing and limit the threat of staff exposing the public to COVID-19 or vice versa. Our staff is here to serve you, and we urge you that rather than coming in to the office in person you contact our office via phone: 773-887-3772, text: 773-985-3510, or email at [[URL REDACTED]]
* All ward nights through the end of April will be conducted via phone. Appointment to speak with Ald. Ramirez-Rosa about any issue can be scheduled by emailing Jessica Vasquez at [[URL REDACTED]] These phone call appointments can be made for the time regularly scheduled for ward night (every other Monday from 5pm to 7pm), or at a time convenient to you.
* Ald. Ramirez-Rosa has directed the Department of Finance and local police suspend residential permit parking enforcement throughout the entire 35th Ward until April 15 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Residents are having difficulty purchasing RPP daily passes, acquiring letters of exception from our office to submit at the City Clerk's Office, and are experiencing overall difficulty with finding parking spaces due to residents staying home for social isolation. Many residents are also facing the loss of their job, and adding the additional burden of residential permit parking passes or a ticket is burdensome.
* We have switched all of our Community-Driven Zoning and Development (CDZD) public meetings to conference calls and online feedback forms. Please refer to our weekly newsletter for updates on when these conference calls will take place. We have also suspended all other public meetings organized by our office through the end of April.
* Ald. Ramirez-Rosa also asks that if you are willing and able to please consider ordering delivery from a local 35th Ward restaurant - they could really use our support right now. As always, tip well.
* Governor Pritzker's 'Stay At Home Order' deems ""restaurants for consumption off-premises"" with ""curbside pick-up"" as ""essential businesses."" Accordingly, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa has asked our local police to not impede our 'tamaleros' or food street vendors, working people feeding working people.
Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa and the 35th Ward team are working to ensure that City services continue to be delivered and run smoothly. Do not hesitate to reach out to us with any concerns about local matters. As your elected voice at City Hall, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa is fighting to amend city code and bring resources to bare to support our working families, our small businesses, and our neighborhoods during this crisis. In the days to come you will hear more about an ordinance he is authoring alongside progressive colleagues to address this public health crisis. This ordinance seeks to provide our Mayor and City Council with the tools necessary to prevent further community spread of a contagious and life threatening virus by providing our working families with the support and relief they need and deserve.

## ComEd Taking Steps to Support Customers
ComEd is suspending service disconnects, providing resources and payment accommodations for those who may have challenges paying their monthly energy bill.
In coordination with work being led by Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle to protect Illinoisans, ComEd is taking action to help its customers with payment assistance programs and by imposing a moratorium on service disconnections and waiving new late payment charges through at least May 1, as many businesses and institutions are following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by taking temporary measures to shut down or limit operations to control the spread of COVID-19.
ComEd is also taking steps to expand awareness of the programs in place to help customers through temporary or extended financial hardship and will be working with customers on a case-by-case basis to establish payment arrangements and identify energy assistance options.
Customers who struggle to cover their energy expenses have a growing range of assistance options from ComEd. The company offers financial assistance programs and flexible payment options, all of which can help eligible customers reduce budget strain and avoid disconnection of service. Particularly during this time when some customers are facing unforeseen circumstances, ComEd will work on a case-by-case basis with customers who are struggling to pay their energy bills to help them remain in service.
ComEd offers payment options such as budget billing, which averages payments out over a 12-month period to help customers manage their monthly energy bill, and flexible payment arrangements, including individually tailored payment installment plans. Customers who may be experiencing financial hardship should visit [[URL REDACTED]] or call 800-334-7661.
Financial Assistance Programs
* Under the Residential Special Hardship program, customers who face financial hardship
such as job loss, illness or military deployment, or senior or disability hardships, may be
eligible for grants based on need.
* The CHAMP (ComEd Helps Activated/Veteran Military Personnel) program enables
activated and deployed members of the U.S. Armed Forces, National Guard and Reserves,
and honorably discharged veterans to apply for grants of up to $1,000 once every two
years, deferred payment plans, cancellation of late charges and other benefits.
* Under the Nonprofit Special Hardship program, nonprofit organizations that struggle to
pay their electric bills may be eligible for grants of up to $2,000 once every two years to
help them cover their expenses and continue to fulfill their missions and serve the
community.
* The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) enables low-income
households to apply for assistance paying for winter energy services. Administered by
community agencies throughout the areas ComEd serves, LIHEAP is funded by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services and the state of Illinois.

## Paid Sick Leave Is The Law In Chicago
The Paid Sick Leave ordinance mandates that all Chicago businesses provide paid sick leave to employees. This ordinance is especially important during a public health emergency where sick workers should be encouraged to stay home and should not fear losing needed income to cover medical bills or living expenses. Therefore, workers and businesses should be mindful that paid sick leave is the law in Chicago.
Any employee who works at least 80 hours for an employer in Chicago within any 120-day period is covered by the ordinance and is eligible for paid sick leave. Employees begin to accrue paid sick leave on the first calendar day after they begin their employment. For every 40 hours worked, employees accrue one hour of paid sick leave. See the notice below for more information.
See the current Ordinance for further detail.
Workers should report violations of Chicago's paid sick leave ordinance. They can do so by calling our 35th Ward Office, calling 311, using CHI 311, or by filling out a Complaint Form, (Español).

8,"That hasn't stopped President Trump from flagrantly disregarding the Hatch Act.
Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend, we already knew that Donald Trump feels that he’s above the law. He’s demonstrated it time and again.
Last week, he continued the pattern during the Republican National Convention, turning the White House into a cheap prop for his re-election campaign.
Picture of the White House lawn during the RNC with Trump reelection propaganda.
It wasn’t just the President. He’s packed his administration with others who believe they’re above the law:
* Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a convention speech from Jerusalem, where he was traveling on the taxpayer’s dime.
* First Lady Melania Trump addressed the Republican National Convention from the Rose Garden.
* Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf staged an official naturalization ceremony as part of the televised convention.
There’s a reason why neither party has ever used the White House as the backdrop for their convention: it’s against the law.
A 1939 law called the Hatch Act made it a crime for government employees to do political work at taxpayer expense, and it bars the President from ordering federal workers to engage in political activity like, for example, throwing a political convention on the White House lawn.
It’s disgraceful, friend. With Senate Republicans enabling his lawless behavior, it’s clear the President believes he is above the law.
We need to send a message that laws and ethics still matter. To do that, we need to run this lawless President and his enablers out of town and flip the Senate blue. That starts with re-electing Mark Warner. Can you pitch in to Mark’s campaign and help us send a strong message on Election Day?

Join #TeamHagerty For Tonight's Presidential Debate
Joe Biden will finally leave his basement and answer real questions without using a teleprompter or pre-screened talking points. Tonight, the American people will have the opportunity to compare Biden's public record, nearly 50 years full of empty promises and failed policies, to President Donald Trump’s record over the last four years - a record of promises made and promises kept.
Follow along with Bill during tonight's debate HERE.
Confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett Now
Last week, President Donald Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill Justice Ginsberg's seat on the Supreme Court. Judge Barrett is a dedicated Christian public servant — a solid constitutionalist, who will steadfastly serve our nation. The Democrats are already attacking her faith - just think of what they’re capable of doing to our religious freedom. We must support President Trump and the Republican Senate Majority and confirm Judge Barrett now.
Read Hagerty's full statement on Judge Barrett's nomination HERE.
Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! We have another election to win in November. This time, it's not just sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must reelect President Donald Trump for four more years and expand our Republican supermajority in Tennessee so we can continue to stand up to the radical liberals who want to make America a socialist country.
Are You Registered To Vote?
Early voting begins in only 15 days! Make sure you're registered to vote and are ready to support President Trump and Team Hagerty in the election this November.
You can register and find out more information on your polling location HERE.

12,"Bill Olson for Congress
Hi Alex,
My name is Bill Olson, and I am a conservative Christian combat vet running to take back a Swing district - Florida’s 9th District, currently held by liberal Democrat Darren Soto.
As a decorated U.S. Army vet who saw combat in the Middle East, my country- and our freedoms- mean something to me!
Along the way, I was recognized for my service: four Army Achievement Medals, the Army Commendation Medal, and two Meritorious Service Medals.
I also received an additional Army Commendation Medal for my meritorious service in liberating Kuwait during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, and in 2008 I was awarded the Bronze Star for exceptionally meritorious service during the global war on terror in Afghanistan.
So you can imagine, being an Army lifer, that serving my country - protecting my country and our freedoms - is a VERY big deal to me!
That said, what I am MOST proud of, is that my passion for serving my country was passed on to my three sons.
I am NOT a career politician…. Just someone who spent most of his adult life, risking my life for your freedom.
here is nothing I’d rather do - I’m a fighter and I love my country and my fellow citizens!
Now I want to take that fighting spirit to Congress- and Nancy Pelosi and her band of Socialists don’t stand a chance.
I’m running against a career politician: Democrat Darren Soto.
I need your help today \- to replace Darren Soto, stop the radicals in Congress, stop impeachment and win Florida for the Republicans! Can you help me?
Liberal Democrat Darren Soto did not serve in the military. Instead, he votes with AOC and her anti-American ""Squad"" over 95% of the time!
I think those who have laid the most on the line for our country and its citizens- whose who have taken an Oath to defend the Constitution- are the ones best fit to defend our Constitution in Congress.
I always knew Darren Soto was bad, but when the Conservative Review Liberty Scorecards came out, we found out just how bad...
Darren Soto got 17% for the last Congress- an ""F"" rating.
His score is nearly identical to Speaker Pelosi, because Soto is Nancy Pelosi's lap dog - he sold his voting card to her a long time ago!
Soto votes every time to fund Planned Parenthood.
He votes for gun control - every time.
What really upsets me is that Soto's Democrats went all-in on impeaching the President. They have become SO radicalized, they impeached the President for nothing more than political payback!
Time for that to stop!
Me, I’m not a career politician. I don't have a fancy family pedigree.
I earned my education in the Cold War frontiers of Germany and South Korea, as well as the battlefields of Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan. That's why I'm 100% behind the President's ""America First"" policies!
I’m running to fight for American greatness, American peace, and American pride.
I am a Christian conservative. I believe that when you swear an oath to defend the Constitution, that oath has no expiration date!
Impeachment was never supposed to be a method of resolving our political disputes. It's supposed to be a rare way to remove a President who has committed high crimes.
President Trump is innocent! And he is a great President and a great American. We must defend him and re-elect him!
This isn't what the Constitution envisioned. This sad spectacle of partisan revenge is not what America is!
President Trump is innocent! We need to make sure the crazy Democrats pay dearly for what they are doing. And we do that at the ballot box!
And for that, Florida will be key.
In 2016, President Trump won by expanding the field, winning in places Republicans hadn't won lately.
The Democrats in 2020 are trying to return the favor- trying to win in Florida.
Let's be clear - there is NO Republican win in 2020 without Florida.
Florida is so pivotal. The electoral votes, along with so many Republican-leaning and swing congressional districts, make this state of paramount importance.
Plus, it's now President Trump's home state!
People here have no tolerance for the Dems' impeachment scam. They have no tolerance for the crazy policies and socialism.
We are red-blooded Americans! Democrats like AOC and her extremism have no place here.
Me? I'm a working class guy who loves God and my country. I'm 100% behind the President's ""America First"" policies!
Perhaps you agree with me, that we need more Bible, more Constitution - and less crazy liberal Democrats like Darren Soto.
If so, then I need your help!
Darren Soto will have all of Nancy Pelosi's Swamp money. That's why I need your help today- to replace Darren Soto, and support the President!
Can you help me?
I need to raise $23,500 before the end of this month to let the people of Central Florida know about Soto's liberal record.
Can I count on you for a donation of $25, $50, $100, $250, $500, $1000.... all the way to the Federal maximum donation of $2800 per individual, $5600 per couple?
The Democrats are going to lose next year \- but only if we let the American people know what they have done. It's up to us!
Let's get this done!

Patriot,
With all their guns aimed at Tucker Carlson, you’d think the radical Left would have their hands full.
But no…
They’ve now turned their guns ALSO on Sean Hannity in hopes they can kill two birds with one socialist stone.
Ever since Donald Trump won on election night in 2016, Barack Obama’s political network has been in socialist revolution mode.
And Hannity has called them out on it!
That’s why they hate him so much…he’s exposing their lies, corruption and Deep State collusion against President Trump.
We're rallying the Tea Party troops to launch our counter-revolution against the radical Left to circle the wagons for Hannity...
…because they just ESCALATED their plan to take him out, too.
##  SIGN THE PETITION:
DEFEND HANNITY!
Just this week Hannity called out the radical leftist Democrats for their failed leadership:
> ""We have Pelosi. We have Schumer. We have Biden. 125 years of swamp failure. They have done nothing to quell inner-city violent crime anywhere in America, nothing to fix the broken dilapidated disgusting and repulsive educational system. They have failed America's children. We have far left mayors. They have ruled these cities for decades. They have completely failed their citizens.""
They HATE Hannity for exposing the truth!
So in order to shut him up, they’ve launched a scandalous — completely bogus — lawsuit against both Hannity and Tucker...
…they recruited a disgruntled former employee to make scurrilous claims of harassment at Fox News…which “have no basis in fact whatsoever.""
But the truth has never gotten in the way of the radical Left’s plan to entirely destroy conservative patriots and remove them from the airways!
The problem is, if we don’t step up and defend Hannity alongside our defense of Tucker, it’s only a matter of time before they prevail!
If you think this is just fear-mongering, think again. This is EXACTLY how they took down Bill O’Reilly!
With O’Reilly’s head on a proverbial pike, they’re foaming at the mouth to lop off Hannity’s head, too.
If we lose Hannity’s critical voice, cutting through lies and deception from the Left, President Trump’s ability to counteract the fake news media will be severely muted ahead of November.
That's why I need you to sign Hannity's petition right now and join the counter-revolution to keep him on the air. Will you sign?

My friend, what do you think is more terrifying?
Starving to death as vultures circle above, picking at the flesh of dozens of dead horses around her…
Or The Horse Slaughter Kingpin being on the loose to torture and abuse more animals?
Image
DONATE NOW >>
It’s a heartbreaking scenario either way, sadly.
But when I learned that Manuel Coto – America’s “Horse Slaughter Kingpin”, was captured and let go AGAIN, I launched ARM’s most important campaign to date.
And as I write this, he is a free man, continuing his business of slaughtering innocent horses and animals.
Coto was arrested again for abusing and neglecting 24 horses - one who, on arrival, was so emaciated that it had to be euthanized.
“There were dozens and dozens if not hundreds of bones and skeletal remains....Malnourished horses including the horse that could not stand”
Coto has such an extensive rap sheet, and his latest victim suffered senselessly. What’s worse is that he has been in operation for decades but has evaded serious conviction.
Law enforcement lets him go free time and time again. The Attorney General is NOT taking this seriously. And the Kingpin’s reach is growing as he expands operations all over the state.
That’s why ARM must continue to be boots on the ground, keep up the pressure on the Attorney General, and keep exposing the truth through mainstream media about this horrible killer. He is a danger to animals, people, and society!
HEADLINE: “Animal Recovery Mission calling for stiff
punishments against alleged horse abuser”
Image

DONATE NOW >>
Plain and simple: The Kingpin is a monster doing unimaginable things to animals.
* He owns and operates a lucrative, but highly illegal animal slaughter farm that tortures and kills animals in cold blood.
* He butchers horses while they are still alive and sells their flesh for human consumption on the black market.
* He neglects and starves horses to death, leaving them to be eaten by buzzards.
But dedicating every day to taking down animal abusers doesn’t come easily or cheaply.
You see, our investigations are physically, mentally, and financially exhausting, and like with Coto, they can continue for years. And then there are the animals at ARM Sanctuary, who are survivors of these horrific crimes. Every one of them requires urgent veterinary care, food, and the immediate construction of shelters.
But ARM can only take down as many of these killers and provide for as many survivors as we can afford.
DEADLINE: the most important thing you can do to LOCK HIM UP is rush a tax-deductible gift.
Liquid error: wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 2), I'm counting on your support.

Claudia for Congress
Friend,
Every day, there are new stories of dangerous criminals who are now roaming the streets thanks to dangerous bail reform policies implemented by Anthony Brindisi’s closest ally in Albany, Governor Cuomo and the out of control Democrats in Albany.
So far, robbers, murderers, and drunken hit-and-run drivers have been set free under bail reform. Unsurprisingly, many of those released have committed more crimes.
This issue affects everyone in New York, so we need to hear from you directly.
Sign our petition if you oppose New York’s short-sighted, dangerous bail reform law!
Add your name!
Instead of trusting New York’s law enforcement and judges, liberal Democrats in Albany upended the criminal justice system with soft-on-crime bail reform. As a result, these criminals’ victims and the general public are at risk, and the authorities responsible for holding them accountable have been constrained.
The General Assembly rushed to craft dangerous, headline-grabbing reforms instead of working with law enforcement officials to craft a policy that would make public safety a top priority. The future of our state is at risk thanks to short-sighted and dysfunctional actions in Albany.
Because this policy is so dangerous, we need signatures from 5,000 New Yorkers by midnight!
Do you oppose New York’s failed bail reform?
Add your name!
It’s time to stand up to the dysfunction in Albany! Make your voice heard on bail reform now: [[URL REDACTED]]

Friend
I was very disappointed today to learn that Ben McAdams will be voting to impeach President Donald Trump. As many of you know, I have supported President Trump on several key issues and I have disagreed with other decisions he has made. But the choice to impeach any president is much bigger than the person who currently holds the office. We must think about the future implications of how all future presidents will be treated. We must protect the highest office in the land from a highly politicized process. Let me tell you why I do not support the impeachment of our commander in chief.
* This is the fastest impeachment proceeding in our nation’s history. The Democrats could be taking the necessary time to find out the truth first hand but they have admittedly rushed the process to affect the upcoming election. According to their own statements they are impeaching the President to affect the election, not to get to the truth.
* The Democrats have failed to produce a crime. This is important because our founding document specifically states that a high crime or misdemeanor is required to impeach a president. This requirement is not a suggestion. The Democrats want you to believe that President Trump has committed a crime by not allowing witnesses to testify and by refusing to hand over documents. This too is a mis-characterization of the facts. As was stated by Professor Jonathon Turley from George Washington University, a President has the right to appeal to the Supreme Court when given a subpoena from Congress. This is the right of the President and it cannot be seen as a violation of the law. If so it would render the third branch of government irrelevant.
Please join me in supporting President Trump against dishonest Democrat attacks by donating to our campaigns. Half of each donation will go directly to President Trump's re-election campaign.

Wendy Davis for Congress
Friend,
Today, the House of Representatives voted to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate – where they'll debate whether to convict Donald Trump of high crimes and misdemeanors.
Moments like these test our country's character: Will we stand up and do the right thing, even when it's hard? Or will we take the easy way out? My opponent, Rep. Chip Roy, took the easy way out. He voted to protect a president who undermined our national security for personal and political gain – putting his party before his country.
I don't want my grandbabies to grow up in a world where their leaders take the easy way out. That's why, when I was first sworn into the Fort Worth City Council, I made a promise to myself that I would always vote my conscience – even when it means speaking truth to power.
On this historic day for our nation, I want to know what your conscience is telling you. I'm hoping to hear from 3,200 supporters, including you, before midnight, so please respond now:
Should the Senate convict Donald Trump?
YES
NO
Thank you for speaking out.

# In Case Anyone Still Wants to Defund the Police…
July 7, 2020
Our Voice
Welcome to “Our Voice,” a brief 90-second review of the week featuring updates from our campaign and a look at the latest conservative news.
In Case Anyone Still Wants to Defund the Police…
The leftist mob wants you to believe defunding the police will help lead to equal justice. Newsflash, it doesn’t. Here is the reform we need to discuss: The violence and crime rate of cities with Democratic leaders. 77 people were shot just this past weekend in Chicago, 12 of them being under the age of 18. We see “Justice for George Floyd” plastered all over social media, but what about “Justice for Natalia Wallace?” Natalia Wallace, a sweet, 7-year-old child, was shot and killed the evening of July Fourth while playing outside with friends. No child should ever have to worry about being shot and killed while playing outside.
My heart absolutely breaks for Natalia Wallace, and other children like her who have suffered the same fate. We need to see real action come of these lawless acts of hatred and recklessness within our American cities. This needs to start with local leadership. Without well trained law enforcement, who follow proper procedures, we would only see crime rates across our country skyrocket. When will the left realize all the police are not the problem?

Let Our Children go Back to School 🚨
With all the coronavirus back and forth nowadays, one question still remains: Will our children be able to go back to school in the fall? President Trump has voiced his support for schools reopening in the fall, while national Democrats are declining to take a stand either way.
It is no secret our children need to go back to school. Unfortunately, the left is afraid to agree with this fact because it doesn’t fit their “destroy Trump” narrative. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) expressed their concerns with students not returning to the classroom this fall. Virtual classrooms not only hinder a child’s educational experience, but also affect their social skills and the irreplaceable lessons they learn within the classroom. We can find a way to keep our teachers and children safe while still having them learn.

24,"Today I have an important announcement View this email in your browser
The impeachment charade continues unabated today in the House Judiciary Committee. Chairman Nadler ignores the rules and precedents set over the long history of our country in order to ram fake, unsupported charges against an elected President through this kangaroo court.
At the same time, Congressional Democrats continue to prevent meaningful reform of our immigration system and a physical barrier on our southern border even as American citizens are victimized by crime, drugs, and cheap labor pouring across it.
I came to Washington to fight for our shared values.
It is now obvious that the fight will continue through 2020 and beyond.
So, with prayerful consideration, today I officially filed to run again to be the Representative for the 6th Congressional District of Texas.
Representing you with passion and wisdom is my sacred obligation, and a great honor.
Will you support me as I stand with you by contributing $25, $50, or more to my reelection campaign?
Together we can stop the impeachment charade and take real action at the border.
With so many big issues at stake…USMCA, trade, prescription drugs, taxes, and debt…it is insane for the Democrats to focus on trying to undo an election.
That is why I keep fighting: to support President Trump’s policies and protect his reforms from the radical left that seeks to unmake the progress of the last three years.
Please #BackTheBowtie with a generous donation now and together we can help Keep America Great!

Patriot,
With all their guns aimed at Tucker Carlson, you’d think the radical Left would have their hands full.
But no…
They’ve now turned their guns ALSO on Sean Hannity in hopes they can kill two birds with one socialist stone.
Ever since Donald Trump won on election night in 2016, Barack Obama’s political network has been in socialist revolution mode.
And Hannity has called them out on it!
That’s why they hate him so much…he’s exposing their lies, corruption and Deep State collusion against President Trump.
We're rallying the Tea Party troops to launch our counter-revolution against the radical Left to circle the wagons for Hannity...
…because they just ESCALATED their plan to take him out, too.
##  SIGN THE PETITION:
DEFEND HANNITY!
Just this week Hannity called out the radical leftist Democrats for their failed leadership:
> ""We have Pelosi. We have Schumer. We have Biden. 125 years of swamp failure. They have done nothing to quell inner-city violent crime anywhere in America, nothing to fix the broken dilapidated disgusting and repulsive educational system. They have failed America's children. We have far left mayors. They have ruled these cities for decades. They have completely failed their citizens.""
They HATE Hannity for exposing the truth!
So in order to shut him up, they’ve launched a scandalous — completely bogus — ""attack campaign"" against both Hannity and Tucker...
…they recruited a disgruntled former employee to make scurrilous claims of harassment at Fox News…which “have no basis in fact whatsoever.""
But the truth has never gotten in the way of the radical Left’s plan to entirely destroy conservative patriots and remove them from the airways!
The problem is, if we don’t step up and defend Hannity alongside our defense of Tucker, it’s only a matter of time before they prevail!
If you think this is just fear-mongering, think again. This is EXACTLY how they took down Bill O’Reilly!
With O’Reilly’s head on a proverbial pike, they’re foaming at the mouth to lop off Hannity’s head, too.
If we lose Hannity’s critical voice, cutting through lies and deception from the Left, President Trump’s ability to counteract the fake news media will be severely muted ahead of November.
That's why I need you to sign Hannity's petition right now and join the counter-revolution to keep him on the air. Will you sign?

CEO, [[URL REDACTED]]

28,"Joe Biden made his unsurprising announcement that Kamala Harris will be his Vice Presidential running mate.
Laura Loomer for Congress
Patriot,
Joe Biden made his unsurprising announcement that Kamala Harris will be his Vice Presidential running mate.
I’ve dealt with Kamala Harris and exposed her blatant political corruption back in 2017 as an investigative journalist.
Of course, the Mainstream Media didn’t run with the story at the time so let me tell you a bit about what I uncovered.
In October of 2016, Trump supporter and activist, Mark Feigin was arrested and charged by then California Attorney General Kamala Harris for making “criminal threats” and “annoying phone calls” to an Islamic Center.
It turns out, Feigin didn’t make the calls, but I found out who did, and I published the police interviews that took place with the real culprit.
Despite Mr. Feigin being TOTALLY cleared of the false accusations, Kamala wouldn’t stop and demanded he sign a plea agreement that required 5 years of formal probation, and community service that would be SUPERVISED BY A MUSLIM GROUP.
Kamala Harris also demanded that Mark Feigin denounce the “Alt-Right” even though he was never associated with it.
That’s right, Kamala Harris demanded a U.S. Citizen denounce beliefs after falsely charging him with a hate crime.
Kamala is the poster child of political corruption and with her elevation to the #2 most powerful Democrat in the nation, you can rest assured that AOC, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and every other power-hungry Democrat in Congress will emulate Kamala’s model to use the government against political adversaries.
And I plan on being in Congress in 2021 to stop them. Help me get there today.
We’re days away from Primary Day in Florida and my eyes are set on the General Election and meeting our fundraising goals to win in November.
We have $36,725 left to raise before Primary Day. Will you chip in $10 today and ask a friend to do the same?
Our General Election media blitz needs to be funded with a war chest to compete against my Democrat opponent and any amount you can donate will help us get there. Chip in $10, $20 or whatever you can afford.
Kamala Harris will be the new corrupt “attack dog” of the Left as Joe Biden can’t even string along a sentence and she’ll spawn a dozen wannabe’s in Congress who will be hell-bent on destroying or silencing any conservative who challenges them.
But they’ve tried that with me . . . for years.
They failed, I’m still here and they know that when they send their attack dogs after me, they’re the ones who get bitten.
Send me to Washington by donating today.
Thank you again for all that you do.
Respectfully,
Laura Loomer

####  Virginia apartment manager ends screening policy barring renters with minor convictions
By JEFF SOUTH, Virginia Mercury
A company that manages about 1,700 of apartments in Northern Virginia has agreed to stop automatically rejecting any applicant with a criminal conviction no matter how old or minor — a policy that fair-housing advocates said discriminated against Black and Latino renters. As a result of a lawsuit filed by Housing Opportunities Made Equal of Virginia, Kay Management Co. agreed to screen applicants primarily for felony convictions within the past five years. Under the new policy, the company can look 10 or more years into an applicant’s past only for homicides or serious sex- or drug-related crimes.

####  How COVID-19 Spread, and Was Contained, at Two Nursing Homes
By MEGAN PAULY AND MALLORY NOE-PAYNE, WCVE
Before the COVID-19 outbreak was over, almost every resident of a small nursing home in the Shenandoah Valley would contract the virus. The facility’s administrator would get it, so many staff would quit it would become a struggle to keep the facility functioning, and 22 people -- about a fifth of the residents -- would die. Meanwhile, at a nursing home just hours away in Richmond, COVID-19 patients would be kept to a single floor with dedicated staff, isolated from the rest of the population. Only 13 residents and four staff members would get the virus, and none would die.

####  In former Confederate capital, a push to honor the enslaved
By SARAH RANKIN, Associated Press
For more than 150 years, Virginia’s capital city greeted visitors with a landscape steeped in Confederate heritage and dotted with its relics, including a collection of enormous statues to rebel fighters. Tucked away, or in many cases buried, was evidence of Richmond’s pivotal role in the lucrative domestic slave trade. Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children were jailed, bought and sold in the city, and shipped across the South in the decades preceding the Civil War.

With Congress preparing to debate relaxing restrictions on emergency aid to state and local governments, Gov. Ralph Northam is sending almost $645 million in federal funds to localities to help them weather the coronavirus crisis and its economic repercussions.

What was not discussed until near the meeting’s end — and only then was referenced indirectly with no names mentioned — was the town-wide rumor regarding the recent departure of an employee who has been accused of crimes.

Robert E. Lee committed treason when he became general of the Army of Northern Virginia in support of Southern secession. Its goal was a separate nation devoted to white supremacy and black slavery. But with the Union victory, Lee submitted to federal authority and set an example of reconciliation for a defeated South. Lee’s post-war leadership of Washington College led the faculty to ask that his name be added to the school’s masthead.
Morel is the John K. Boardman, Jr. Professor of Politics at Washington and Lee University and author of “Lincoln and the American Founding,” recently published by Southern Illinois University Press.

30,"Dear Alex,
I am Sandy Smith, the Republican nominee for Congress in North Carolina’s newly redrawn 1st Congressional district.
I am a patriot who has had it with unconstitutional lockdown orders, given by liberal Trump-hating socialist Democrats who are trying to tank the economy to hurt the President politically.
Mean-spirited left-wing partisan hack governors have been punishing ordinary citizens all across the country, for the ""crime"" of trying to feed their families and avoid losing their businesses.
Image
In Michigan, their Democrat Governor is persecuting small businesses like a 77-year old barber:
State regulators on Wednesday suspended the license of a 77-year-old Michigan barber who insisted on cutting hair despite an order to stay closed during the coronavirus pandemic.
Karl Manke has pledged to keep his shop open “until Jesus comes.” A judge declined the state’s request to shut down his shop Monday without first holding a hearing. Regulators took a different path by suspending his barber license and his shop license.
In Oregon, their governor sent Child Protective Services to harass a small business owner who tried to open in defiance of their Democrat governor's order:
Oregon Occupational Safety and Health issued a $14,000 fine to Lindsey Graham, owner of Glamor Salon in Salem, for reopening her salon May 5 in defiance of Gov. Kate Brown's stay-home order.
""I'm being threatened and intimidated and bullied daily by the government,"" Graham said during a press conference Friday. ""I'm sad that I can drive 20 minutes down the freeway, and that person's job as a hairstylist is essential, according to Kate Brown. But my job, 20 minutes up the street, is nonessential.""
""I don't want anyone to get sick. I know you guys don't want anyone to get sick,"" Graham said. ""But I also don't want to go bankrupt and lose everything I worked for and neither do you.""
She also claimed that Child Protective Services had visited her house and questioned her child. ""I've never expected such a violent, aggressive, vindictive thing could ever be done to me or my family,"" she said, ""because I'm trying to earn a living, because I'm trying to work.""
Here in North Carolina, we have another one of these abusive governors, Roy Cooper.
This guy is every bit the tinpot dictator that the governors of Michigan and Oregon are. You may recall that the Republican National Convention (which I will attend as a Trump delegate!) is in Charlotte, NC in August:
President Donald Trump this week accused North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper of “playing politics” with reopening the state, and said it would be “bad for them” if the state were to delay the start of the Republican National Convention in Charlotte.
“No, no,” Trump replied. “We’ll have a convention. I’m a traditionalist, but we’ll have to see, like everything else, but I think we’ll be in good shape by that time. We have a great state, North Carolina, that’s been very, very good.
“Although, it’s got a Democrat governor, so we have to be a little bit careful. It’s got a Democrat governor, so we have to be a little bit careful with that, because they’re playing politics. They’re playing politics, as you know, by delaying the openings. ... To me that’s politics. They think it’s a bad thing for me if they delay the opening. I think it’s bad for them. And you have people protesting outside, and those people like Trump.”
Image
Our hyper-partisan governor would cancel the RNC if he thought he could get away with it. That's how these tyrannical Democrat governors roll. I have never met anyone so lost in what he is doing. A lost socialist is very very dangerous because you combine incompetence with bad left wing policy at the same time.
I've had it with these people. It is now abundantly clear that their motives were NEVER to keep anyone safe or healthy. It's to accumulate power for themselves, punish those who work for a living to support their families, and tank the economy for the election.
I am disgusted and shocked by their actions. No red-blooded American should ever stand for tyranny, and no one should stand for political-fueled retributions, either.
If you are proud of our president, as I am, I need YOUR help urgently to defeat my high-level radical socialist Democrat opponent and retake this swing seat!
Let's send a message to the Socialist NC governor. Let's show these tyrants that they can't get away with this.
I am proud of those who are standing to fight with me. I have already been endorsed by Congressman Mark Walker, Congressman Ted Budd, and Congressman Mark Meadows. Here is a picture of me and Mark Meadows. Congressman Meadows used to be Chairman of the Freedom Caucus, and now he is the President Trump’s Chief of Staff in the White House. He “proudly endorsed” me shortly before his promotion, which I was so honored!
Image
President Trump has accomplished so much with constant pushback from the socialists, like these governors. Imagine what he can do with a supportive Congress!
It is so crucial that we take advantage of every chance we have to flip a swing district \- which North Carolina’s First District now is! They just redrew the map and took away a bunch of Democrat voters, making this district MUCH more competitive.
But this year, this district turned into a swing district. Half of the district has never been represented by Butterfield. They don’t know him, and they are Republicans!
Will you help me beat Butterfield and deprive Nancy Pelosi of a reliable vote? I need you to send $15, $35, or $250 right now so that I can meet my goal by the end of this month. This deadline is so critical, and I have no time to lose.
I will NEVER vote with Nancy Pelosi! She and her insane leftist agenda can pound sand!
Can you help me take this swing district back, with your best and immediate contribution of $15, $35, or $250? Taking out one of Pelosi’s leading lieutenants would be a major, crippling blow to the socialist anti-American left and to Nancy Pelosi’s agenda. Please rush back your supporting contribution today. Thank you.
G.K. Butterfield is a leftist extremist, not a patriot, but to replace him I really need your help. I appreciate you and thank you.
For God and Country,

32,"their real plan
catholicvote
email logo
Dear Alex,
If all goes according to plan...
House Democrats will vote to impeach President Trump later tonight.
But the fact is, that’s been the plan for the past three years.
CONSIDER THIS: Since President Trump took the oath of office, House Democrats have introduced legislation to impeach President Trump for colluding with Russia, for denigrating central American countries, for conflicts of [[URL REDACTED]] for criticizing NFL players who kneel during the national anthem!
Earlier this year, Committee Chairman and Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler was overheard on an Amtrak train talking about impeachment schemes. And this was 6 months before any claim of a quid pro quo with Ukraine ever surfaced. It was only a matter of time.
So what should Catholics think?
Impeachment is serious business. It involves accusing the President of a “high crime” and then acting to overturn the result of an election -- because allowing him to continue in office poses too grave a threat. For this reason, impeachment requires making a convincing public case, and backing it up with facts.
On this score, Democrats have failed miserably.
Whether you are pro-Trump, anti-Trump, never-Trump, or just tired of the hyper-partisan gamesmanship altogether, ripping apart the country with a dubious impeachment effort 11 months from an election is both unwarranted and dangerous. It will divide the country further, inflame already-heightened political tensions, and undermine the common good.
We need not detail the many ways this impeachment process has been hamfisted and tainted from the start. From its spurious origins, to its lack of transparency, its hyper-rushed and unfair process, and finally its failure to provide proof of a single crime, the whole thing leads to an obvious conclusion: this impeachment effort represents an abuse of power, carried out for political theater because of Democrats’ deep hatred of President Trump and his policies.
Is President Trump guiltless?
The President is not your typical politician. His style is confrontational and abrasive. And depending on how you interpret his call with Ukraine (which everyone can read), you could certainly claim he mismanaged his desire to clean up widespread corruption in Ukraine with the distribution of foreign aid.
But a high crime and misdemeanor? An “existential threat to the Republic?”
As Joe Biden might say: “C’mon man!”
And don’t forget the center of this controversy. Hunter Biden. A shameless corporate grifter who leveraged his father’s power as Vice President to enrich himself. Is he immune from oversight? Imagine if the tables were turned and Donald Trump Jr. were being paid millions by shady foreign corporations. We know what would happen.
The concept of impeaching a president was once considered a grave matter. Before today, it’s only happened twice in American history (Nixon would have been impeached but he resigned before it happened).
The use of the filibuster was once rare, too. Yet because of Democratic hyper-partisanship, it’s now commonplace in the Senate. And now the danger of making the power of impeachment a regular political tool has been unleashed. You can be sure, if a Democrat is elected President in the future while Republicans control Congress, he or she will face an impeachment vote.
Thankfully, this political charade will end soon.
Reports suggest Senator McConnell may move immediately to fast-track an all-but-certain vote to acquit the President and move on. We certainly hope so.
Furthermore, in the coming months the country will be offered a Democratic alternative to President Trump.
And the American people will be offered a clear choice -- on the issues that matter.
The truth is, in the end, that’s what today’s vote is all about:
November 2020.

34,"It would appear that $60 Million in bribes & dark money isn't enough for Paul to abandon his dear friend Larry Householder.
Friend,
Yesterday, while 91 members of the Ohio House voted to remove the indicted Larry Householder as Speaker, Paul Zeltwanger refused.
When faced with the chance to remove Householder as a member of the House for his crimes against the state and good people of Ohio, Paul Zeltwanger refused again.
Whether it's spreading debunked conspiracy theories about COVID-19 or turning a blind eye to the corruption of his dear friend Householder, Paul Zeltwanger has made it clear that the people of the 54th district will never be his main priority.
Let's send him home.
To that end, can you help us meet our end of the month fundraising goal by chipping in $25 today? Sending Morgan Showen to the Statehouse will bring us one step closer to restoring trust and integrity to the House.
Thanks for all that you do to make our campaign possible.

36,"homicides are up by double-digits in major cities across America this year – and it’s a wake-up call that our country can’t afford the Left’s agenda
Claudia for Congress
Friend,
This year has devastated so many communities across America, and the situation is only being made worse by Democrats who are terrified of facing the facts about their failed leadership.
We need to address what’s going on in our major cities right now.
* Homicides have risen by double-digits in 36 out of America’s 50 largest cities so far this year.
* Recent polls show that 77% of Americans are concerned about rising crime in our cities.
Democrats know why this is happening, but they’ll never admit that they’re the reason!
The Left’s radical crusade against law enforcement is taking a devastating toll on lives and communities across our country, and it will only get worse if we don’t stand up to their anti-police agenda before it’s too late.
CHIP IN TO RESTORE LAW & ORDER THIS NOVEMBER
Our men and women in blue are watching our communities fall apart right now, and they’re calling for backup from Washington – but Democrats like Anthony Brindisi refuse to answer the call!
That’s because Brindisi is more loyal to Pelosi than he is to our police departments, our district, and even the voters who supported him in 2018!
That’s why the New York State Troopers PBA just endorsed our campaign. They’re sick and tired of being abandoned by Congress, and they’re counting on us to change that.

MY CANDIDATE STATEMENT
Ronald Reagan proclaimed our country as a Beacon of Light and a Shining City on a Hill, but right now we are not reaching our potential as a country.
We need leaders with solutions. We need leaders that can relate to the struggles of everyday people. Most importantly, we need leaders that value honesty and new ideas.
I understand your struggles and I am bringing new ideas, the needed experience and a fresh perspective to the table that will help restore the American dream.
As a business owner and concerned citizen, I worry for the future of Californian families. We have high taxes, increased crime, inadequate enforcement of immigration laws and growing poverty rates.
In Orange County, rents are skyrocketing, homelessness is on the rise, and regardless of party, leaders are not acting in good faith to the great people they represent.
The last thing we need right now are more career politicians. It is time for change and I will never stop fighting on behalf of you!
I am running on a Pro-Constitution, American Family Values and Common-Sense Conservative platform. Once I am your Congressman, we will Make Orange County Great Again!
My campaign is For Our Country and For Our Future. I graciously ask for your vote in this upcoming election. I encourage you to go to my website, [[URL REDACTED]], to read my story and my platform.

Dear Patriot
It's Aliscia Andrews here, and as you know, I'm a U. S. Marine, National security expert who has worked keeping our nation safe at the border, and a mom who has seen the Left destroy this country one piece at a time.
This is a district that has been Republican for 60 out of the last 66 years and can be flipped with your support!
I’m done letting it happen. I’m fighting back with everything I have.
I’ve spent a career keeping this nation safe. Now, the Left is trying to undo all of our security by abolishing the police, abolishing law and order, and keeping our economy shackled in lockdown.
Can I count on you to join our stand against Socialism? Donate $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, or any other amount today and you can help us stop the Socialist Left from taking over!
DONATE TODAY!
There are only 28 Days left!
We have a choice—we can either choose President Trump, the side that’s beating the coronavirus or the Socialist Radical Left that wants to topple all public safety in the middle of a crime wave and a pandemic.
I’m standing with our President!
He beat the coronavirus and just left the hospital! But, not before thanking the tens of thousands of Trump supporters for coming to pray for him!
The Left lost their minds when he did this. They beat their keyboards screaming about how he isn’t really sick, endangered people, and other nonsense accusations!
If President Obama had done the exact same thing after getting sick, they would be fawning over him for his bravery.
The Fake News media is blinded by fanatical leftist hatred against our President. No President has been more mistreated by the Fake News media!
Let’s send them a strong message— let’s retire Socialist Wexton who wrongly tweeted that our President is a white supremacist!
That’s just sick!
Please donate your most generous gift today and we can stop the Socialist Left here and now! We only have 28 days and we need to keep up with Bloomberg’s spending here in the 10th!
God Bless,

I am Wendy Rogers, the Republican nominee for Arizona Senate. I won my primary in a rout because I am tough on illegal immigration! I am President Trump's biggest supporter on this issue... and he has stood up for us in ways no President ever has!
The President made it clear from the start: He was standing up for the American people, and he didn't care who opposed him. And I'm so glad he did!
Just this week he proposed lowering refugee admissions to the lowest level in history!
He is helping Arizona more than anyone else has:
After years of leading the world in refugee admissions, the number of refugees admitted to the U.S. has plummeted under the Trump administration.
The Trump administration proposed Wednesday that the U.S. would admit no more than 15,000 refugees in fiscal year 2021, which began Oct. 1. That is the lowest number since the refugee program began in 1980, and 3,000 fewer than the 18,000 ceiling the Trump administration set in 2020, the previous historic low.
Arizona has long been one of the main states for accepting refugees from around the world.
""The President’s proposal for refugee resettlement in Fiscal Year 2021 reflects the Administration’s continuing commitment to prioritize the safety and well-being of Americans, especially in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,"" the statement said.

His policies getting tough on immigration have directly helped Arizona. We were being overrun by illegal immigrants, drug cartels, crime, gangs, and murders- before the President took action.
Now we have stabilized our situation which allows us to deal with other problems, like COVID. He has really helped Arizona! That's why, in the Arizona Senate, I intend to push for restrictions on illegal immigration to support the President's policies and protect Arizonans from crime and drugs.
Cops are being shot. Innocent peoples' businesses and homes burnt. And they want to not be held accountable for it, by getting rid of our brave police.
Will you help me support the President's policies?
George Soros and the extreme Left are supporting my Democrat opponent. I can beat her- but I need your help!
If we are to stop Soros and Antifa, it has to be done at the polls. And that's why I need your help urgently!
Time is slipping by. Just a month to go- and the Left thinks they can take my seat. I need your help to stop them from stealing this thing!
I was one of the first 100 women to fly in the Air Force. I will not be bullied by the far Left- not now, not ever!
Voting by mail is happening here right now. I have no time to waste. I need your help urgently to get our message out!
The Far-Left and their media allies have done hit pieces on me to try to blunt my momentum. That's why I need your help to fend off these attacks!
Please, rush back your maximum donation of $15, $35, $60, $100, $250 or whatever you can afford right now help me fend off Soros and the Swamp and win this seat!
Arizona First,
Gratefully,

44,"Friend,
Kelly stood strong for law-and-order this week - taking several major actions to support our police officers, crack down on criminals, and bring peace back to our streets.
In major news, Kelly was the first candidate in her race to call for convicted cop killers to be sentenced to death for their crimes. Her strong stand comes just days after two sheriff's deputies – who are still recovering in the hospital – were brutally ambushed by a masked gunman in Los Angeles. As Kelly said:
""For months, the radical left’s defund the police movement has promoted violence, chaos and anarchy in cities across our country, while villainizing and attacking the brave men and women in law enforcement who risk their lives to keep us safe. Now these dangerous leftists have started putting words into violent action — targeting and brutally attacking law enforcement. That’s why today I am calling for convicted cop killers in America to be sentenced to death.""
In fact, Kelly even blasted Kamala Harris this week for her failure to denounce the ""disgusting"" display of hatred toward the injured deputies by protesters outside the hospital. She slammed Kamala for promoting a bail fund to free violent criminals - including those who are targeting our police officers on the streets. And later in the week, Kelly took action - joining her colleagues to introduce the ""Serve and Protect Act,"" which would slap offenders like the Compton gunman with a 10 years-to-life sentence for targeting law enforcement officers for assault or murder.
In addition to being recognized for her law-and-order values this week, Kelly also won praise for her pro-life positions - receiving an ""A"" rating from the Susan B. Anthony List, which has already strongly endorsed her campaign. Kelly is 100% pro-life - and will always fight against the abortion-on-demand agenda of the Left.
On top of that, Kelly took a few more principled stands this week - slamming Disney for its cozy relationship with China, and pushing back hard against Netflix's new Cuties movie for its exploitation of young children. She has led on this issue, calling for a hearing on preventing human and child trafficking.
Finally, Kelly joined President Trump at the White House for the signing of the Abraham Accords, which marked the historic normalization of relations in the Middle East. As Kelly said on the Guy Benson show this week:
""This is the fulfillment of promises made and kept by President Trump from day one. Truly historic to see the leaders from UAE and Bahrain on the stage with Netanyahu and President Trump. Truly historic and important. I mean, this is a fulfillment of the president's promise of ongoing building peace through strength ... He's delivered at every step along the way, whether it's dealing with North Korea or Iran and now bringing peace to the Middle East in this very historic and certainly Nobel-peace worthy agreement.""
Speaking of promises kept, Kelly announced this week that Accura Engineering, a Georgia-owned business, has been awarded a government contract to play a key role in constructing the border wall. Kelly is a strong proponent of President Trump's wall, and she is thrilled to see a Georgia business contribute so much to this effort.
While Kelly fights for conservative Georgia values, the same can't be said for her opponents. Doug Collins is a weak-on-crime career politician who has teamed up with radical liberal Stacey Abrams to undercut the 2nd Amendment, raise taxes on hardworking Georgians, and reduce prison time for violent criminals. Instead of fighting for Georgians, Doug spent years embracing Abrams and building close friendships with unhinged liberals like impeachment manager Hakeem Jeffries, who called Donald Trump the ""grand wizard of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.""

Jacob Blake is innocent. But that didn’t stop Kenosha police officers from shooting him 7 times in the back for no reason.
But the officers who shot Blake, leaving him paralyzed for life, still haven’t been charged with any crime -- it’s unbelievable.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are DEMANDING the officer who shot Blake be charged and held accountable for his crime, and they need EVERY good Democrat standing with them to call for IMMEDIATE justice.
Biden and Harris need 100,000 activists to sign on TODAY. Justice cannot wait. Sign your name now →

Justice must be served.
Jacob Blake was shot in front of his three small children. He spent the following days in the hospital fighting for his life. He’s paralyzed.
“Dismantling systemic racism starts with demanding justice and holding offenders accountable. Based on what I've seen, it seems the officer should be charged.”
Kamala Harris
Jacob Blake is innocent. But his innocence couldn’t protect him from the horrors of police brutality. Just like it couldn’t protect George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and countless more.
What makes this all even worse is that Kenosha cops were seen cozying up to white supremacists in the ensuing protests. Their racism runs deep.
So we’re standing with Biden and Harris to DEMAND the officer who shot Blake be charged.
Biden and Harris need every Good Democrat standing with them to DEMAND justice for Jacob Blake. Sign on to demand the officer who shot Blake be charged →

47,"Meuser for Congress
Alex --
Good evening and welcome to our Week-End Update.
This week, much of the news in Washington revolved around the impeachment hearings in the U.S. Senate. Over the past months and weeks, I have detailed my feelings regarding the impeachment sham.
I believe that the Wall Street Journal’s Kimberly Strassel encapsulates many of the points I have been stressing and makes a compelling case, in her piece Crying Wolf on Impeachment against the Democratic leadership. She writes:
“The impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump is coming down to one big question: Will Democrats, by crying wolf, drown out the more legitimate Republican cry of foul? ‘Foul’ has served as the GOP’s most powerful and honest argument from the first days of these impeachment maneuverings.”
“Democrats broke every standard of due process, transparency and fairness in their House investigation, making a mockery of their constitutional duty.”
* “They hid the identity of the original accuser, denying Republicans and the country the ability to judge his motives.”
* “They held secret depositions, barring more than three-quarters of House members, as well as the press and the American public.”
* “They called 18 witnesses, but blocked the president from calling any in his defense.”
* “The White House legal team was excluded from the proceedings—prohibited from cross-examining witnesses, denied the ability to introduce any evidence that spoke to the central question of the president’s focus on Ukrainian corruption.”
* “Democrats approved two articles of impeachment that failed to identify a crime.”
The U.S. Senate rejected the call for more witnesses in the impeachment trial. House Democratic Leadership has failed to make a case for impeachment and there is no reason to call additional witnesses. It was interesting to see that the Democrats were hellbent on calling additional witnesses as long as they are not Joe or Hunter Biden. Maybe because they are like an onion, the more you peel the Bidens back, the more you cry. Thankfully for our nation, it appears this saga will be concluding in the coming days... or as the New York Post headline reads below, it's ""All Over But The Pouting.""
The President made strides in our efforts towards peace between Israel and Palestine. Peace requires compromise, but Israel cannot compromise the security of their country or its people. President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu created an agreement that balances peaceful coexistence with the need for security.
Additionally, President Trump signed the USMCA trade agreement.
This historic trade deal is another example of President Trump’s policies putting our workers, farmers, and manufacturers first.
* USMCA adds $68 billion to our economy and will create 176,000 jobs nationwide. The President signing USMCA delivers a key promise to level the playing field for our country in trade.
* Mexico and Canada are key markets for goods and agricultural products from Pennsylvania. This deal supports farmers and businesses in our district by improving their market access and is an especially great improvement for our dairy producers.
* USMCA ushers in a more balanced and fairer trading relationship for North America and is a big win for America and Pennsylvania.
I spoke on the floor of the United States House this week about the different definitions of productivity at the two ends of Pennsylvania Avenue at this point in time. At the Capitol, Democrat Leadership continues to confuse activity with accomplishment. They have spent YEARS trying to impeach and remove a duly elected president. However, at the White House, President Trump has delivered two significant victories this week... a middle east peace plan and the signing of the USMCA. Just imagine of all the energy from this impeachment was used to solve the problems of the American people. It is critical Republicans #TakeBackTheHouse
IN NEWS YOU WON’T HEAR IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA: This week, I voted against the House Democrat Leadership's attempt to further weaken our countries ability to respond to terrorists in a combat zone by stripping the President as Commander and Chief's authority to engage our military to target and eliminate terrorists or enemies of the state. This authority was effectively put to use to takeout terrorist Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Soleimani was designated a terrorist by multiple countries. This legislation is being brought to the House floor for a vote only to damage the President politically and with a blind eye to our countries safety.
The 2002 Authorization for Use MF authorizes military action to “defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq,” including against ISIS and threats directed by Iran.
Repealing the Authorization for Use of Military Force without a replacement would undermine the Iraqi government, send the wrong signal to our regional partners and allies, and embolden Iran-backed militia groups who fuel sectarian violence.
On Tuesday, we paused to observe Holocaust Remembrance Day and recognize the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We remember the survivors, those who were lost and pledge to fight anti-Semitism. #NeverAgain
We also recognized School Choice Week. Families should have the ability to choose a school that best fits their needs, child’s skills and interests. This is an opportunity to advocate for choice and celebrate public, private, parochial and all schools educating our youth for the jobs of today and tomorrow.
Today is also the beginning of Black History Month and we celebrate the lasting legacies of African Americans whose lives have shaped our nation’s history and culture. Today, black Americans have someone in the White House in President Trump who is delivering record low unemployment.
One of the most significant accomplishments of the Trump Administration has been the President’s success in making our nation energy independent. No longer are we held hostage to the Middle East as we work to ensure our nation can produce its own power to keep us all moving. As part of that effort, President Trump is working to save over 1,000 family-sustaining jobs in Pennsylvania by helping to keep the refinery in Philadelphia open. Click here to read more.
I joined other members of Congress as we received a briefing from Dr. Redfield from the Center for Disease Control, Dr. Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Kadlec from the Department of Health and Human Services, and Jonathan Fritz and Yolanda Parra from the State Department regarding the coronavirus. Their briefing provided the following information:
* At this time, the virus poses a low risk to the United States and there are only 5 confirmed cases here.
* There are 6,000 confirmed cases in China concentrated mostly in Wuhan Province. Chinese officials have severely restricted travel from Wuhan Province to contain the virus there.
* Treatments are being developed but may take a year to be fully developed. As health officials contain this virus, the U.S. CDC recommends against all nonessential travel to China.
* The CDC feels the best way to contain coronavirus is through classic public health measures such as maintaining a high level of hygiene, regularly washing your hands, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and face.
Chinese and American officials are in regular contact and we will receive updates as will the general public. I will provide future updates as I receive them. For additional information about coronavirus and how to prevent its spread, visit the CDC website.
In the District, I want to send out my congratulations and support to Lebanon County’s former District Attorney and our new State Senator Dave Arnold. Dave was sworn-in on Wednesday and will be a tremendous addition Harrisburg. Dave is a conservative and understands that smaller government and lower taxes leads to prosperity. As many of you know. Dave was diagnosed with brain cancer shortly after receiving the GOP nomination for State Senate. Dave is beating cancer and his doctors have given him an excellent prognosis. This situation highlights the strength of Dave’s family as his wife and daughter stood by his side as he battled cancer and won his election to the state senate. I look forward to working alongside Dave as we focus on making Lebanon County an even better place to live, work and raise our families.
Additionally, I want to acknowledge our new Lebanon County District Attorney Pier Hess Graf. She will be a strong voice against crime and be tenacious in her work to keep our streets safe.
As a reminder, as this is an election year, we have begun circulating petitions to run for reelection to Congress. Petition circulation begins this Tuesday, January 28th. If you would like to join our team, please let us know. For copies of petitions, questions or information regarding petition events across the District, please contact our Field Campaign Manager Rob Bresnahan at [[URL REDACTED]]
Today, we attended the Berks County GOP meeting, where I officially announced my intentions to seek another term in office. Representing the people of the 9th District is a tremendous honor and responsibility. My goal every day is to do what’s in the best interests of the families, neighborhoods and communities in our District. Berks County has always been so welcoming to our campaign and we felt it was appropriate to make our formal reelection announcement surrounding by our friends and supporters in the County. Pictured below with GOP Auditor General candidate Tim DeFoor and a younger supporter Suzannah Gillen who I gave my lapel pin.
Later, we attended the Columbia County GOP Winter Picnic. We were joined by State Senator John Gordner and State Representatives David Millard and Kurt Masser. This was a great event and there is a lot of enthusiasm for President Trump and the Republican ticket. Pictured below with Ashok & Naymesh Patel and children.
Last week, we inserted a political cartoon we thought was timely regarding the impeachment effort. This week, I have another cartoon I found that I think is appropriate considering tomorrow is Groundhog Day. Enjoy.
On Monday, I will appear on WPPA “Step up to the Mic” from 10-11 am. If you get a chance, please be sure to tune in.
Thank you and we will see you soon,

Wow, what a month!
June was Pride Month — and Ralph Norman fought to allow employers to discriminate against LGBTQ+ Americans just for being who they are.
We’ve been reckoning with the epidemic of racism against Black Americans — and Ralph Norman initially voted against making lynching a federal hate crime.
We’ve been dealing with a spike in COVID-19 infections here in South Carolina — and Ralph Norman voted against COVID-19 relief for South Carolina families.
REPLACE RALPH »
I’ll be honest, team — I can’t find a reason not to show Ralph Norman the door.
But it’s not going to be easy, because all that energy Ralph hasn’t spent fighting for South Carolinians like you and me, he’s spent building his business in Congress and running hundreds of thousands of dollars of Facebook ads to hold on to his seat.

49,"How Color Of Change PAC was born
#  Voting While Black
Hey Friend,
#ByeAnita. In this little hashtag lies the origin story of Color Of Change PAC.
I’m Jenni, I lead the digital and communications teams for Color Of Change PAC. You don’t usually hear from me because most of my work is behind-the-scenes, but today I want to tell you our origin story, and how it's connected to re-electing Kim Foxx in 20 days.
(If you already know you support Kim Foxx, the most powerful action you can take is donating $3 to help our organizer Audrey in Chicago reach the thousands of people we need to win and continue transforming criminal justice. Otherwise, read on!)
Back in 2016, Color Of Change PAC barely existed. But over years of working on criminal justice campaigns, our team had started realizing that district attorneys, state’s attorneys, and other public prosecutors are some of the most powerful players in the justice system. They have the power to decide who gets charged with crimes and who doesn't, whether police are held accountable for harming and killing people, whether cash bail keeps poor people locked up, and so much more.
We heard about a candidate in Cook County, IL named Kim Foxx, who was challenging then-State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez. Alvarez had made national headlines for refusing for over a year to charge the police officer who shot 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times in Chicago. Kim Foxx was promising to hold officers accountable, to stop targeting Black and Latinx communities with low-level crimes, and to provide real safety and support for Cook County residents.
So I was hired (just as a short-term position back then!) to help elect Foxx, only a few weeks before the election. Back then, you seldom heard anything about prosecutor elections or the importance of showing up in them. So I sent digital ads all over Chicago informing tens of thousands of people about the upcoming election, making sure Black communities heard and recognized Kim Foxx’s name. And along with our partners on the ground, we got #ByeAnita trending all over social media.
Then that March, Election Day came around-- and Kim Foxx won! And in the last 4 years, she’s proven that fighting to elect her has been worth it. In just 4 years Kim Foxx has:
* Helped thousands of struggling people get into rehab and job programs, and provided services for students at risk of incarceration
* Cleared the names of over 1000 people with racist marijuana convictions from the War on Drugs
* Led the nation in exonerations, with 94 innocent people’s names cleared
Kim Foxx’s election was the first time that Color Of Change PAC got to actually elect a candidate who improved Black people’s lives. We were literally making our vision for our organization a reality.
Friend, my biggest fear is that if another “tough-on-crime” prosecutor is elected, all of the progress Kim Foxx has made will be destroyed. That’s why I have to ask: will you donate $3 to help us reach all the undecided voters we can in the next 20 days and convince them to vote for Kim Foxx?
I don’t want Black people in Cook County to fear being thrown in jail for struggling with addiction or mental illness or poverty.
I don’t want young people’s lives wasted behind bars for mistakes they made as children.
And I definitely don’t want to see any police officer not have to answer for killing an innocent person in the streets.
But I’ve spoken with Audrey, our organizer in Chicago, and there are still a lot of people who aren’t sure whether to vote for Kim Foxx.
We have 20 days to change their minds. Are you with us?
Yes, I want to donate to help people break the cycle of mass incarceration and live safe, thriving lives under Kim Foxx's leadership!

Thank you for all you do, friend. Let’s win this.
