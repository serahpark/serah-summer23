SUPREME COURT RULING: Donald J. Trump Must Release His Tax Returns
'US Supreme Court rules Trump must turn over financial records' - Al Jazeera
100,000 URGENT SIGNATURES NEEDED TO FORCE DONALD J. TRUMP TO COMPLY WITH THE SUPREME COURT AND RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS >>
I, ALEX BROWN, DEMAND TRUMP RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS >>
This petition is registered to [[EMAIL_REDACTED]]. Your signature is required before 11:59PM. Failure to sign could result in Trump getting off the hook for his crimes.
Alex -- It’s happening.
The Supreme Court ruled Donald Trump MUST hand over his taxes. Once his crimes are exposed, Trump will LOSE his bid for the White House!!
So Trump’s corrupt lawyers are fighting to tooth and nail to COVER-UP his tax returns.
They’re ignoring the Supreme Court. It’s OUTRIGHT corruption!!
If we collect 100,000 signatures DEMANDING Trump’s tax returns → we can expose Trump for the FRAUD and LIAR that he is!
But that means we need your signature before midnight. Without your signature, Trump will go totally FREE. Can you SIGN NOW? We still need [7] signatures from 43620 to meet our goal! >>

# Ward condemns Gosar statement
On 18 June, Anne Marie Ward condemned Paul Gosar’s recent attack on law enforcement. Gosar was quoted in the Payson Roundup as saying that, “[t]he police in this country have lost the support of millions of Americans who do not trust their judgment. From the murder of Mr. Floyd to harassing suburban moms in a park, or old people on a beach, law enforcement has created a trust problem for themselves.”
Anne Marie sharply criticized Gosar’s statement. “Paul should apologize to his constituents and to all law enforcement officers in Arizona. This is totally inappropriate for a member of Congress to say in ANY context. Unlike my opponent, I fully support our brave police officers. AZ04 loves our men and women in blue (Paul, you might know this if you actually lived in the district you pretend to represent)!”
Ward has distinguished herself from Gosar in her strong support of law enforcement, pointing to Gosar’s votes against 9/11 first responders and against making it a federal crime to commit a targeted attack on law enforcement.
Ward has been a vocal supporter of law enforcement. On 13 June, she posted a photo on social media that was widely shared across the district, expressing her support of police officers. Three days later, a campaign sign of hers was vandalized with the acronym, “ACAB” (All Cops are Bastards). Ward responded on social media by again offering her full support to law enforcement and by calling for civility. She posted on 17 June: “We cannot make positive change in this country by using hateful and derogatory language, whether racially driven or by the profession which someone pursues ... there is far more that unites us in this country than divides us. We can no longer allow career politicians to use tragedies like this to break our nation into rivaling factions for their own political gain.”
In light of Gosar’s critical statement on law enforcement, Ward further stated on 18 June: “Paul Gosar’s comment lumps the entire profession of law enforcement into a category of bad actors who do not deserve our trust. I can’t overstate how damaging this is. We deserve better from our representative.” The primary faceoff between Ward and Gosar — who resides outside the district — is on Aug. 4, 2020.
Anne Marie Ward is a Republican candidate for U.S. Congress in AZ-04.

Thank you for supporting Brady PAC today! We’re working to pass meaningful, life-saving legislation to END the scourge of gun violence across America.
We have a comprehensive plan to elect gun reform champions and end the bloodshed. But no one is going to change our laws for us. If we sit idly by, the corporate gun lobby will keep its fatal grip on power, and we’ll continue to lose lives to senseless violence. So we’re turning to you for your help to save lives before it’s too late. Will you do your part and donate?
DONATE TO PASS REAL GUN SAFETY REFORM >>
The NRA couldn’t care less about the lives we lose every day to gun violence. They’ll do whatever it takes to keep themselves in power -- no matter the human cost.
We know we send you a lot of emails, Alex. But we can’t fight back against the NRA without help from thousands of grassroots activists. We don’t take checks from shady lobbyists -- instead, we rely on a grassroots army of gun safety activists from across the nation to fund our campaign. We simply can’t do our work without you.

Four years ago, Wisconsin gambled on Donald [[URL REDACTED]] and we lost.
Bad numbers
Boy was that a bust! But even as the odds of a second Trump term continue to dwindle, a new Supreme Court decision to throw out mail ballots in Wisconsin that are postmarked by Election Day but arrive after November 3rd, makes it clear that although a Joe Biden victory is not guaranteed, collusion and cheating by Donald Trump, his Republican lapdogs, and now the illegitimate US Supreme Court, is. Will you help me stop it by helping me GET OUT THE VOTE IN WISCONSIN?
Contribute
We cannot place the same bet again.
A vote for Trump is a lot like playing the lottery. Your odds of winning are low, but your odds of losing are high. Play Trump’s numbers and see where that gets us:
226,000 \- The amount of Americans dead so far due to COVID-19
26 -The amount of women who have accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct
5,500 -The number of children separated from their parents at the US/Mexican border
7.9% \- The US jobless rate in September
8 \- The number of Trump associates arrested or convicted of crimes
$750 \- The amount of taxes Trump paid in 2016 and 2017
Donald Trump has gambled away people’s lives and livelihoods to enrich himself and to serve his personal and financial interests his entire life. And he’s played with house money to do so.
In a few days, we have a chance to reshuffle the deck and deal ourselves a winning hand with a Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ticket. But it doesn’t just stop at the Presidential race. To #WINsconsin, we have to max bet on BLUE and vote for every Democrat in every race, everywhere.

If we don’t play our cards right this time, we could be facing another four years of bad bets and HUGE losses. And the American people aint playing this time.

Alex,
In the 50 days since Albany Democrats’ new Cashless Bail law has been in effect, an unprecedented number criminals have been instantly released back into our communities to commit more crimes.
Just last weekend in NYC, a thief thanked Democrats for releasing him after his 139th arrest saying, “Bail reform, it’s lit!... It’s the Democrats! The Democrats know me and the Republicans fear me. You can’t touch me! I can’t be stopped!”
This man had previously received several stints in prison and committed 6 felonies, 87 misdemeanors, and had 21 court hearings.
Alex, cashless bail does not need tiny changes... it needs a full repeal ASAP. Do you agree? Let Lee know here >>>
Instead of handcuffing criminals, Democrats are handcuffing Lady Justice, but I want to know where YOU stand, Alex.
Do you support the new Cashless Bail law?
COMPLETE SURVEY HERE
I want to know what you think of this law that puts our communities at risk. Share your thoughts and take our one-question survey>>>>

Senator Kamala Harris joins The Sip tomorrow at 5:00 pm ET—you don’t want to miss this!
Senator Harris is one of our most passionate and outspoken champions for racial equality and police reform. Earlier this month she, along with Senator Cory Booker, co-sponsored common sense legislation to make lynching a federal crime.
That bill was held from passage by unanimous consent in the Senate, but Senator Harris didn’t let that slow her down. She is currently engaged in a legislative battle to ensure that any police reform legislation that passes in the Senate is robust enough to meet the needs of communities of color across the country.
* #TheSipHour TOMORROW at 5:00pm ET with special guests:
*       * Glynda C. Carr, President & CEO, Higher Heights
* Tracy Sturdivant, President, The League
* Adrianne Shropshire, Founder, Black PAC
* Judith Browne Dianis, Executive Director, Advancement Project National Office
* Fatima Goss Graves, President & CEO, National Women's Law Center
* Senator Kamala Harris
View The Sip Hour, Friday at 5 PM ET Here
This is a very special conversation you don’t want to miss! Senator Harris is a lifelong public safety and civil rights leader. She is the second Black woman in history to be elected to the U.S. Senate, the first Black person and first woman to serve as Attorney General of the state of California, and the third Black woman to ever run for the President of the United States of America.
Grab a drink tomorrow and let’s toast to breaking down barriers and fighting the good fight!

We need 100,000 Democrats to stand with Biden and Harris NOW and demand justice for Jacob Blake. Sign your name →
I DEMAND JUSTICE. ADD MY NAME ➞
Jacob Blake is innocent. But that didn’t stop Kenosha police officers from shooting him 7 times in the back for no reason.
But the officers who shot Blake, leaving him paralyzed for life, still haven’t been charged with any crime -- it’s unbelievable.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are DEMANDING the officer who shot Blake be charged and held accountable for his crime, and they need EVERY good Democrat standing with them to call for IMMEDIATE justice.
Biden and Harris need 100,000 activists to sign on TODAY. Justice cannot wait. Sign your name now →
I DEMAND JUSTICE. ADD MY NAME ➞
Justice must be served.
Jacob Blake was shot in front of his three small children. He spent the following days in the hospital fighting for his life. He’s paralyzed.
“Dismantling systemic racism starts with demanding justice and holding offenders accountable. Based on what I've seen, it seems the officer should be charged.”
Kamala Harris
Jacob Blake is innocent. But his innocence couldn’t protect him from the horrors of police brutality. Just like it couldn’t protect George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and countless more.
What makes this all even worse is that Kenosha cops were seen cozying up to white supremacists in the ensuing protests. Their racism runs deep.
So we’re standing with Biden and Harris to DEMAND the officer who shot Blake be charged.
Biden and Harris need every Good Democrat standing with them to DEMAND justice for Jacob Blake. Sign on to demand the officer who shot Blake be charged →
I DEMAND JUSTICE. ADD MY NAME ➞
Black Americans deserve the right to get into their own car, free from harm.
This is an injustice that cannot be ignored. And it will take an army of grassroots activists like you to finally be taken seriously.

7,"Friend:
This afternoon, we were informed of our state’s fourth COVID-19 death, the second COVID-19 death in Chicago. As a state, we mourn the loss of our fellow Illinoisans -- and we commit to one another that we will take the necessary steps to prevent further spread of this virus.
Sadly, even with the measures our state and city have taken, COVID-19 will claim many more Illinoisans’ lives before things get better. At the moment we have 212 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the City of Chicago, and 585 in Illinois. With limited testing capabilities, the total number of cases is likely many more.
That is why today Governor Pritzker took the necessary and important step of issuing a “Stay At Home” Executive Order.
* The order stipulates that only businesses and operations deemed essential can remain open. Read the list of essential businesses by clicking here. All other business operations must cease or allow their employees to work from home. This order is in place through April 7, but may be extended.
* Under this order, local restaurants for consumption off-premises are ""essential businesses."" Local restaurants can remain open as long as they only serve food off-premises, via delivery, drive-through, curbside pick-up, or carry out. Please consider supporting one of our local restaurants this weekend.
* Under this order, you can still walk your dog, roads are still open, you can go to the grocery store or gas station, you can call a plumber to have them come fix your shower - but Governor Pritzker's order is clear: if it’s not essential the order means STAY HOME, practice social distancing and help save lives.
As Governor Pritzker said today, he knows this order will not be without consequences. He was tasked with saving jobs or saving lives. He chose to save lives. To all my fellow Chicagoans that are rightfully anxious and concerned right now - know that your state and city are with you. I know that Governor Pritzker, Mayor Lightfoot, and our 35th Ward team are working hard everyday to mitigate this public health disaster and the ramifications to come.
You may have already lost your job. You may be at risk of losing your job soon. I am following the conversation in Washington, DC closely - working families desperately need relief from the federal government. But I am not waiting for the federal government to act, that is why I am joining with my progressive colleagues to work on an emergency fund to support working people impacted by this pandemic and ensuing recession. I am also joining with my colleagues and community groups to demand a rent freeze, mortgage free, utility freeze, and other important measures to protect our working families during this time.
And I have put my ward office employees to work, building out a plan to ensure vital city services continue to be delivered, and that we are using our ward office resources, administrative and legislative power to support our working families. As a ward office we have resolved to do everything we can to ensure the health security, economic security, and community security of our residents. To that end, we are launching, alongside the office of 33rd Ward Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez, a mutual aid network that will help our most vulnerable residents in our neighborhoods of Albany Park, Irving Park, Avondale, Logan Square, and Hermosa. If you are in need at this time, please let me know. My team and I are here to help. If you are able to help out a neighbor, please let us know. You can sign up to volunteer with our mutual aid network at: [[URL REDACTED]]
We are all in this together. I know that we can rise to the occasion and ensure that we overcome the challenges thrown at us by this pandemic and recession. As always, do not hesitate to reach out.
In solidarity, Carlos
Carlos Ramirez-Rosa
35th Ward Alderman, City of Chicago

## STATE AND COUNTY CORONAVIRUS UPDATES
Governor Pritzker, Chief Justice Evans, and Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart have announced important measures that will protect working families during this outbreak and help stem the community spread of coronavirus.
Governor Pritzker has announced:
* A ""Stay At Home"" Executive Order. This is an important measure to prevent further spread of COVID-19. The order stipulates that only businesses and operations deemed essential can remain open. Read the list of essential businesses by clicking here. All other business operations should cease or allow their employees to work from home. This order is in place through April 7, but may be extended.
* Under this order local restaurants for consumption off-premises are ""essential businesses."" Local restaurants can remain open as long as they only serve food off-premises, via delivery, drive-through, curbside pick-up, or carry out. Please consider supporting one of our local residents today!
* Under the order: you can still walk your dog, roads are still open, you can go to the grocery store or gas station, a plumber can come fix your shower. But if it's not essential, Governor Pritzker's order means STAY HOME, practice social distancing.
* Statewide school closures.

* Students and families in need of food can pick-up their free meals at any CPS school, no questions asked, between 9am and 1pm, Monday through Friday.
* A call for a statewide moratorium on water, natural gas, and electric service disconnections. The Illinois Commerce Commission, which regulates public utilities, joined Governor Pritzker in this call.
* ComEd has voluntarily implemented a moratorium on service disconnections for non-payment, effective immediately. This suspension will apply to both residential and commercial customers and will remain in effect at least until May 1st.
* An expansion of unemployment benefits to cover employees impacted by COVID-19, including workers that are not covered by paid sick leave. To apply visit: [[URL REDACTED]]
* A closure of all bars, restaurants, and cafes to the public, except for pick-up and delivery through April 7. Small businesses will be able to seek assistance from the Illinois Department of Commerce: [[URL REDACTED]]
Cook County Court Chief Justice Evans announced:
* Most civil & non-emergency criminal proceedings will be postponed through April 15.
* There will be no jury trial in a criminal or civil matter - if you have a jury duty summons for this period of time do not report!
* All traffic and misdemeanor matters are postponed
* No orders for an eviction or foreclosure
* During this time marriage court will also be closed, if you are seeking to get married you will need your own officiant
* You will still be able to seek and receive emergency orders of protection (in cases of domestic abuse), and emergency child support.
Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart:
* Suspension of court-ordered evictions for the next 30 days, through April 15, following Chief Justice Evans order suspending most civil and non-emergency criminal proceedings.
Ald. Ramirez-Rosa applauds our state and county leaders for these important measures to protect our working families. Many of these actions are actions that he and his progressive colleagues called for in order to help prevent further community spread of COVID-19.
* * *
## 35TH WARD CORONAVIRUS UPDATES
To further protect our community from the spread of COVID-19, Ald. Ramirez-Rosa has taken the following measures in the 35th Ward:
* The 35th Ward Office is no longer accepting walk-in visitors. This closure of the office to walk-ins is to promote social distancing and limit the threat of staff exposing the public to COVID-19 or vice versa. Our staff is here to serve you, and we urge you that rather than coming in to the office in person you contact our office via phone: 773-887-3772, text: 773-985-3510, or email at [[URL REDACTED]]
* All ward nights through the end of April will be conducted via phone. Appointment to speak with Ald. Ramirez-Rosa about any issue can be scheduled by emailing Jessica Vasquez at [[URL REDACTED]] These phone call appointments can be made for the time regularly scheduled for ward night (every other Monday from 5pm to 7pm), or at a time convenient to you.
* Ald. Ramirez-Rosa has directed the Department of Finance and local police suspend residential permit parking enforcement throughout the entire 35th Ward until April 15 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Residents are having difficulty purchasing RPP daily passes, acquiring letters of exception from our office to submit at the City Clerk's Office, and are experiencing overall difficulty with finding parking spaces due to residents staying home for social isolation. Many residents are also facing the loss of their job, and adding the additional burden of residential permit parking passes or a ticket is burdensome.
* We have switched all of our Community-Driven Zoning and Development (CDZD) public meetings to conference calls and online feedback forms. Please refer to our weekly newsletter for updates on when these conference calls will take place. We have also suspended all other public meetings organized by our office through the end of April.
* Ald. Ramirez-Rosa also asks that if you are willing and able to please consider ordering delivery from a local 35th Ward restaurant - they could really use our support right now. As always, tip well.
* Governor Pritzker's 'Stay At Home Order' deems ""restaurants for consumption off-premises"" with ""curbside pick-up"" as ""essential businesses."" Accordingly, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa has asked our local police to not impede our 'tamaleros' or food street vendors, working people feeding working people.
Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa and the 35th Ward team are working to ensure that City services continue to be delivered and run smoothly. Do not hesitate to reach out to us with any concerns about local matters. As your elected voice at City Hall, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa is fighting to amend city code and bring resources to bare to support our working families, our small businesses, and our neighborhoods during this crisis. In the days to come you will hear more about an ordinance he is authoring alongside progressive colleagues to address this public health crisis. This ordinance seeks to provide our Mayor and City Council with the tools necessary to prevent further community spread of a contagious and life threatening virus by providing our working families with the support and relief they need and deserve.

## ComEd Taking Steps to Support Customers
ComEd is suspending service disconnects, providing resources and payment accommodations for those who may have challenges paying their monthly energy bill.
In coordination with work being led by Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle to protect Illinoisans, ComEd is taking action to help its customers with payment assistance programs and by imposing a moratorium on service disconnections and waiving new late payment charges through at least May 1, as many businesses and institutions are following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by taking temporary measures to shut down or limit operations to control the spread of COVID-19.
ComEd is also taking steps to expand awareness of the programs in place to help customers through temporary or extended financial hardship and will be working with customers on a case-by-case basis to establish payment arrangements and identify energy assistance options.
Customers who struggle to cover their energy expenses have a growing range of assistance options from ComEd. The company offers financial assistance programs and flexible payment options, all of which can help eligible customers reduce budget strain and avoid disconnection of service. Particularly during this time when some customers are facing unforeseen circumstances, ComEd will work on a case-by-case basis with customers who are struggling to pay their energy bills to help them remain in service.
ComEd offers payment options such as budget billing, which averages payments out over a 12-month period to help customers manage their monthly energy bill, and flexible payment arrangements, including individually tailored payment installment plans. Customers who may be experiencing financial hardship should visit [[URL REDACTED]] or call 800-334-7661.
Financial Assistance Programs
* Under the Residential Special Hardship program, customers who face financial hardship
such as job loss, illness or military deployment, or senior or disability hardships, may be
eligible for grants based on need.
* The CHAMP (ComEd Helps Activated/Veteran Military Personnel) program enables
activated and deployed members of the U.S. Armed Forces, National Guard and Reserves,
and honorably discharged veterans to apply for grants of up to $1,000 once every two
years, deferred payment plans, cancellation of late charges and other benefits.
* Under the Nonprofit Special Hardship program, nonprofit organizations that struggle to
pay their electric bills may be eligible for grants of up to $2,000 once every two years to
help them cover their expenses and continue to fulfill their missions and serve the
community.
* The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) enables low-income
households to apply for assistance paying for winter energy services. Administered by
community agencies throughout the areas ComEd serves, LIHEAP is funded by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services and the state of Illinois.

## Paid Sick Leave Is The Law In Chicago
The Paid Sick Leave ordinance mandates that all Chicago businesses provide paid sick leave to employees. This ordinance is especially important during a public health emergency where sick workers should be encouraged to stay home and should not fear losing needed income to cover medical bills or living expenses. Therefore, workers and businesses should be mindful that paid sick leave is the law in Chicago.
Any employee who works at least 80 hours for an employer in Chicago within any 120-day period is covered by the ordinance and is eligible for paid sick leave. Employees begin to accrue paid sick leave on the first calendar day after they begin their employment. For every 40 hours worked, employees accrue one hour of paid sick leave. See the notice below for more information.
See the current Ordinance for further detail.
Workers should report violations of Chicago's paid sick leave ordinance. They can do so by calling our 35th Ward Office, calling 311, using CHI 311, or by filling out a Complaint Form, (Español).

8,"That hasn't stopped President Trump from flagrantly disregarding the Hatch Act.
Mark Warner for Virginia
Friend, we already knew that Donald Trump feels that he’s above the law. He’s demonstrated it time and again.
Last week, he continued the pattern during the Republican National Convention, turning the White House into a cheap prop for his re-election campaign.
Picture of the White House lawn during the RNC with Trump reelection propaganda.
It wasn’t just the President. He’s packed his administration with others who believe they’re above the law:
* Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a convention speech from Jerusalem, where he was traveling on the taxpayer’s dime.
* First Lady Melania Trump addressed the Republican National Convention from the Rose Garden.
* Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf staged an official naturalization ceremony as part of the televised convention.
There’s a reason why neither party has ever used the White House as the backdrop for their convention: it’s against the law.
A 1939 law called the Hatch Act made it a crime for government employees to do political work at taxpayer expense, and it bars the President from ordering federal workers to engage in political activity like, for example, throwing a political convention on the White House lawn.
It’s disgraceful, friend. With Senate Republicans enabling his lawless behavior, it’s clear the President believes he is above the law.
We need to send a message that laws and ethics still matter. To do that, we need to run this lawless President and his enablers out of town and flip the Senate blue. That starts with re-electing Mark Warner. Can you pitch in to Mark’s campaign and help us send a strong message on Election Day?

Join #TeamHagerty For Tonight's Presidential Debate
Joe Biden will finally leave his basement and answer real questions without using a teleprompter or pre-screened talking points. Tonight, the American people will have the opportunity to compare Biden's public record, nearly 50 years full of empty promises and failed policies, to President Donald Trump’s record over the last four years - a record of promises made and promises kept.
Follow along with Bill during tonight's debate HERE.
Confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett Now
Last week, President Donald Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill Justice Ginsberg's seat on the Supreme Court. Judge Barrett is a dedicated Christian public servant — a solid constitutionalist, who will steadfastly serve our nation. The Democrats are already attacking her faith - just think of what they’re capable of doing to our religious freedom. We must support President Trump and the Republican Senate Majority and confirm Judge Barrett now.
Read Hagerty's full statement on Judge Barrett's nomination HERE.
Looking To November
We are so proud of all of the work Team Hagerty has done to get us this far, but the race isn't over yet! We have another election to win in November. This time, it's not just sending Bill to the United States Senate, we must reelect President Donald Trump for four more years and expand our Republican supermajority in Tennessee so we can continue to stand up to the radical liberals who want to make America a socialist country.
Are You Registered To Vote?
Early voting begins in only 15 days! Make sure you're registered to vote and are ready to support President Trump and Team Hagerty in the election this November.
You can register and find out more information on your polling location HERE.

12,"Bill Olson for Congress
Hi Alex,
My name is Bill Olson, and I am a conservative Christian combat vet running to take back a Swing district - Florida’s 9th District, currently held by liberal Democrat Darren Soto.
As a decorated U.S. Army vet who saw combat in the Middle East, my country- and our freedoms- mean something to me!
Along the way, I was recognized for my service: four Army Achievement Medals, the Army Commendation Medal, and two Meritorious Service Medals.
I also received an additional Army Commendation Medal for my meritorious service in liberating Kuwait during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, and in 2008 I was awarded the Bronze Star for exceptionally meritorious service during the global war on terror in Afghanistan.
So you can imagine, being an Army lifer, that serving my country - protecting my country and our freedoms - is a VERY big deal to me!
That said, what I am MOST proud of, is that my passion for serving my country was passed on to my three sons.
I am NOT a career politician…. Just someone who spent most of his adult life, risking my life for your freedom.
here is nothing I’d rather do - I’m a fighter and I love my country and my fellow citizens!
Now I want to take that fighting spirit to Congress- and Nancy Pelosi and her band of Socialists don’t stand a chance.
I’m running against a career politician: Democrat Darren Soto.
I need your help today \- to replace Darren Soto, stop the radicals in Congress, stop impeachment and win Florida for the Republicans! Can you help me?
Liberal Democrat Darren Soto did not serve in the military. Instead, he votes with AOC and her anti-American ""Squad"" over 95% of the time!
I think those who have laid the most on the line for our country and its citizens- whose who have taken an Oath to defend the Constitution- are the ones best fit to defend our Constitution in Congress.
I always knew Darren Soto was bad, but when the Conservative Review Liberty Scorecards came out, we found out just how bad...
Darren Soto got 17% for the last Congress- an ""F"" rating.
His score is nearly identical to Speaker Pelosi, because Soto is Nancy Pelosi's lap dog - he sold his voting card to her a long time ago!
Soto votes every time to fund Planned Parenthood.
He votes for gun control - every time.
What really upsets me is that Soto's Democrats went all-in on impeaching the President. They have become SO radicalized, they impeached the President for nothing more than political payback!
Time for that to stop!
Me, I’m not a career politician. I don't have a fancy family pedigree.
I earned my education in the Cold War frontiers of Germany and South Korea, as well as the battlefields of Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan. That's why I'm 100% behind the President's ""America First"" policies!
I’m running to fight for American greatness, American peace, and American pride.
I am a Christian conservative. I believe that when you swear an oath to defend the Constitution, that oath has no expiration date!
Impeachment was never supposed to be a method of resolving our political disputes. It's supposed to be a rare way to remove a President who has committed high crimes.
President Trump is innocent! And he is a great President and a great American. We must defend him and re-elect him!
This isn't what the Constitution envisioned. This sad spectacle of partisan revenge is not what America is!
President Trump is innocent! We need to make sure the crazy Democrats pay dearly for what they are doing. And we do that at the ballot box!
And for that, Florida will be key.
In 2016, President Trump won by expanding the field, winning in places Republicans hadn't won lately.
The Democrats in 2020 are trying to return the favor- trying to win in Florida.
Let's be clear - there is NO Republican win in 2020 without Florida.
Florida is so pivotal. The electoral votes, along with so many Republican-leaning and swing congressional districts, make this state of paramount importance.
Plus, it's now President Trump's home state!
People here have no tolerance for the Dems' impeachment scam. They have no tolerance for the crazy policies and socialism.
We are red-blooded Americans! Democrats like AOC and her extremism have no place here.
Me? I'm a working class guy who loves God and my country. I'm 100% behind the President's ""America First"" policies!
Perhaps you agree with me, that we need more Bible, more Constitution - and less crazy liberal Democrats like Darren Soto.
If so, then I need your help!
Darren Soto will have all of Nancy Pelosi's Swamp money. That's why I need your help today- to replace Darren Soto, and support the President!
Can you help me?
I need to raise $23,500 before the end of this month to let the people of Central Florida know about Soto's liberal record.
Can I count on you for a donation of $25, $50, $100, $250, $500, $1000.... all the way to the Federal maximum donation of $2800 per individual, $5600 per couple?
The Democrats are going to lose next year \- but only if we let the American people know what they have done. It's up to us!
Let's get this done!

Patriot,
With all their guns aimed at Tucker Carlson, you’d think the radical Left would have their hands full.
But no…
They’ve now turned their guns ALSO on Sean Hannity in hopes they can kill two birds with one socialist stone.
Ever since Donald Trump won on election night in 2016, Barack Obama’s political network has been in socialist revolution mode.
And Hannity has called them out on it!
That’s why they hate him so much…he’s exposing their lies, corruption and Deep State collusion against President Trump.
We're rallying the Tea Party troops to launch our counter-revolution against the radical Left to circle the wagons for Hannity...
…because they just ESCALATED their plan to take him out, too.
##  SIGN THE PETITION:
DEFEND HANNITY!
Just this week Hannity called out the radical leftist Democrats for their failed leadership:
> ""We have Pelosi. We have Schumer. We have Biden. 125 years of swamp failure. They have done nothing to quell inner-city violent crime anywhere in America, nothing to fix the broken dilapidated disgusting and repulsive educational system. They have failed America's children. We have far left mayors. They have ruled these cities for decades. They have completely failed their citizens.""
They HATE Hannity for exposing the truth!
So in order to shut him up, they’ve launched a scandalous — completely bogus — lawsuit against both Hannity and Tucker...
…they recruited a disgruntled former employee to make scurrilous claims of harassment at Fox News…which “have no basis in fact whatsoever.""
But the truth has never gotten in the way of the radical Left’s plan to entirely destroy conservative patriots and remove them from the airways!
The problem is, if we don’t step up and defend Hannity alongside our defense of Tucker, it’s only a matter of time before they prevail!
If you think this is just fear-mongering, think again. This is EXACTLY how they took down Bill O’Reilly!
With O’Reilly’s head on a proverbial pike, they’re foaming at the mouth to lop off Hannity’s head, too.
If we lose Hannity’s critical voice, cutting through lies and deception from the Left, President Trump’s ability to counteract the fake news media will be severely muted ahead of November.
That's why I need you to sign Hannity's petition right now and join the counter-revolution to keep him on the air. Will you sign?

My friend, what do you think is more terrifying?
Starving to death as vultures circle above, picking at the flesh of dozens of dead horses around her…
Or The Horse Slaughter Kingpin being on the loose to torture and abuse more animals?
Image
DONATE NOW >>
It’s a heartbreaking scenario either way, sadly.
But when I learned that Manuel Coto – America’s “Horse Slaughter Kingpin”, was captured and let go AGAIN, I launched ARM’s most important campaign to date.
And as I write this, he is a free man, continuing his business of slaughtering innocent horses and animals.
Coto was arrested again for abusing and neglecting 24 horses - one who, on arrival, was so emaciated that it had to be euthanized.
“There were dozens and dozens if not hundreds of bones and skeletal remains....Malnourished horses including the horse that could not stand”
Coto has such an extensive rap sheet, and his latest victim suffered senselessly. What’s worse is that he has been in operation for decades but has evaded serious conviction.
Law enforcement lets him go free time and time again. The Attorney General is NOT taking this seriously. And the Kingpin’s reach is growing as he expands operations all over the state.
That’s why ARM must continue to be boots on the ground, keep up the pressure on the Attorney General, and keep exposing the truth through mainstream media about this horrible killer. He is a danger to animals, people, and society!
HEADLINE: “Animal Recovery Mission calling for stiff
punishments against alleged horse abuser”
Image
Image
DONATE NOW >>
Plain and simple: The Kingpin is a monster doing unimaginable things to animals.
* He owns and operates a lucrative, but highly illegal animal slaughter farm that tortures and kills animals in cold blood.
* He butchers horses while they are still alive and sells their flesh for human consumption on the black market.
* He neglects and starves horses to death, leaving them to be eaten by buzzards.
But dedicating every day to taking down animal abusers doesn’t come easily or cheaply.
You see, our investigations are physically, mentally, and financially exhausting, and like with Coto, they can continue for years. And then there are the animals at ARM Sanctuary, who are survivors of these horrific crimes. Every one of them requires urgent veterinary care, food, and the immediate construction of shelters.
But ARM can only take down as many of these killers and provide for as many survivors as we can afford.
DEADLINE: the most important thing you can do to LOCK HIM UP is rush a tax-deductible gift.
Liquid error: wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 2), I'm counting on your support.

Claudia for Congress
Friend,
Every day, there are new stories of dangerous criminals who are now roaming the streets thanks to dangerous bail reform policies implemented by Anthony Brindisi’s closest ally in Albany, Governor Cuomo and the out of control Democrats in Albany.
So far, robbers, murderers, and drunken hit-and-run drivers have been set free under bail reform. Unsurprisingly, many of those released have committed more crimes.
This issue affects everyone in New York, so we need to hear from you directly.
Sign our petition if you oppose New York’s short-sighted, dangerous bail reform law!
Add your name!
Instead of trusting New York’s law enforcement and judges, liberal Democrats in Albany upended the criminal justice system with soft-on-crime bail reform. As a result, these criminals’ victims and the general public are at risk, and the authorities responsible for holding them accountable have been constrained.
The General Assembly rushed to craft dangerous, headline-grabbing reforms instead of working with law enforcement officials to craft a policy that would make public safety a top priority. The future of our state is at risk thanks to short-sighted and dysfunctional actions in Albany.
Because this policy is so dangerous, we need signatures from 5,000 New Yorkers by midnight!
Do you oppose New York’s failed bail reform?
Add your name!
It’s time to stand up to the dysfunction in Albany! Make your voice heard on bail reform now: [[URL REDACTED]]

Friend
I was very disappointed today to learn that Ben McAdams will be voting to impeach President Donald Trump. As many of you know, I have supported President Trump on several key issues and I have disagreed with other decisions he has made. But the choice to impeach any president is much bigger than the person who currently holds the office. We must think about the future implications of how all future presidents will be treated. We must protect the highest office in the land from a highly politicized process. Let me tell you why I do not support the impeachment of our commander in chief.
* This is the fastest impeachment proceeding in our nation’s history. The Democrats could be taking the necessary time to find out the truth first hand but they have admittedly rushed the process to affect the upcoming election. According to their own statements they are impeaching the President to affect the election, not to get to the truth.
* The Democrats have failed to produce a crime. This is important because our founding document specifically states that a high crime or misdemeanor is required to impeach a president. This requirement is not a suggestion. The Democrats want you to believe that President Trump has committed a crime by not allowing witnesses to testify and by refusing to hand over documents. This too is a mis-characterization of the facts. As was stated by Professor Jonathon Turley from George Washington University, a President has the right to appeal to the Supreme Court when given a subpoena from Congress. This is the right of the President and it cannot be seen as a violation of the law. If so it would render the third branch of government irrelevant.

Wendy Davis for Congress
Friend,
Today, the House of Representatives voted to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate – where they'll debate whether to convict Donald Trump of high crimes and misdemeanors.
Moments like these test our country's character: Will we stand up and do the right thing, even when it's hard? Or will we take the easy way out? My opponent, Rep. Chip Roy, took the easy way out. He voted to protect a president who undermined our national security for personal and political gain – putting his party before his country.
I don't want my grandbabies to grow up in a world where their leaders take the easy way out. That's why, when I was first sworn into the Fort Worth City Council, I made a promise to myself that I would always vote my conscience – even when it means speaking truth to power.
On this historic day for our nation, I want to know what your conscience is telling you. I'm hoping to hear from 3,200 supporters, including you, before midnight, so please respond now:
Should the Senate convict Donald Trump?
YES
NO
Thank you for speaking out.

# In Case Anyone Still Wants to Defund the Police…
July 7, 2020
Our Voice
Welcome to “Our Voice,” a brief 90-second review of the week featuring updates from our campaign and a look at the latest conservative news.
In Case Anyone Still Wants to Defund the Police…
The leftist mob wants you to believe defunding the police will help lead to equal justice. Newsflash, it doesn’t. Here is the reform we need to discuss: The violence and crime rate of cities with Democratic leaders. 77 people were shot just this past weekend in Chicago, 12 of them being under the age of 18. We see “Justice for George Floyd” plastered all over social media, but what about “Justice for Natalia Wallace?” Natalia Wallace, a sweet, 7-year-old child, was shot and killed the evening of July Fourth while playing outside with friends. No child should ever have to worry about being shot and killed while playing outside.
My heart absolutely breaks for Natalia Wallace, and other children like her who have suffered the same fate. We need to see real action come of these lawless acts of hatred and recklessness within our American cities. This needs to start with local leadership. Without well trained law enforcement, who follow proper procedures, we would only see crime rates across our country skyrocket. When will the left realize all the police are not the problem?

Let Our Children go Back to School 🚨
With all the coronavirus back and forth nowadays, one question still remains: Will our children be able to go back to school in the fall? President Trump has voiced his support for schools reopening in the fall, while national Democrats are declining to take a stand either way.
It is no secret our children need to go back to school. Unfortunately, the left is afraid to agree with this fact because it doesn’t fit their “destroy Trump” narrative. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) expressed their concerns with students not returning to the classroom this fall. Virtual classrooms not only hinder a child’s educational experience, but also affect their social skills and the irreplaceable lessons they learn within the classroom. We can find a way to keep our teachers and children safe while still having them learn.

24,"Today I have an important announcement View this email in your browser
The impeachment charade continues unabated today in the House Judiciary Committee. Chairman Nadler ignores the rules and precedents set over the long history of our country in order to ram fake, unsupported charges against an elected President through this kangaroo court.
At the same time, Congressional Democrats continue to prevent meaningful reform of our immigration system and a physical barrier on our southern border even as American citizens are victimized by crime, drugs, and cheap labor pouring across it.
I came to Washington to fight for our shared values.
It is now obvious that the fight will continue through 2020 and beyond.
So, with prayerful consideration, today I officially filed to run again to be the Representative for the 6th Congressional District of Texas.
Representing you with passion and wisdom is my sacred obligation, and a great honor.
Will you support me as I stand with you by contributing $25, $50, or more to my reelection campaign?
Together we can stop the impeachment charade and take real action at the border.
With so many big issues at stake…USMCA, trade, prescription drugs, taxes, and debt…it is insane for the Democrats to focus on trying to undo an election.
That is why I keep fighting: to support President Trump’s policies and protect his reforms from the radical left that seeks to unmake the progress of the last three years.
Please #BackTheBowtie with a generous donation now and together we can help Keep America Great!

Patriot,
With all their guns aimed at Tucker Carlson, you’d think the radical Left would have their hands full.
But no…
They’ve now turned their guns ALSO on Sean Hannity in hopes they can kill two birds with one socialist stone.
Ever since Donald Trump won on election night in 2016, Barack Obama’s political network has been in socialist revolution mode.
And Hannity has called them out on it!
That’s why they hate him so much…he’s exposing their lies, corruption and Deep State collusion against President Trump.
We're rallying the Tea Party troops to launch our counter-revolution against the radical Left to circle the wagons for Hannity...
…because they just ESCALATED their plan to take him out, too.
##  SIGN THE PETITION:
DEFEND HANNITY!
Just this week Hannity called out the radical leftist Democrats for their failed leadership:
> ""We have Pelosi. We have Schumer. We have Biden. 125 years of swamp failure. They have done nothing to quell inner-city violent crime anywhere in America, nothing to fix the broken dilapidated disgusting and repulsive educational system. They have failed America's children. We have far left mayors. They have ruled these cities for decades. They have completely failed their citizens.""
They HATE Hannity for exposing the truth!
So in order to shut him up, they’ve launched a scandalous — completely bogus — ""attack campaign"" against both Hannity and Tucker...
…they recruited a disgruntled former employee to make scurrilous claims of harassment at Fox News…which “have no basis in fact whatsoever.""
But the truth has never gotten in the way of the radical Left’s plan to entirely destroy conservative patriots and remove them from the airways!
The problem is, if we don’t step up and defend Hannity alongside our defense of Tucker, it’s only a matter of time before they prevail!
If you think this is just fear-mongering, think again. This is EXACTLY how they took down Bill O’Reilly!
With O’Reilly’s head on a proverbial pike, they’re foaming at the mouth to lop off Hannity’s head, too.
If we lose Hannity’s critical voice, cutting through lies and deception from the Left, President Trump’s ability to counteract the fake news media will be severely muted ahead of November.
That's why I need you to sign Hannity's petition right now and join the counter-revolution to keep him on the air. Will you sign?

CEO, [[URL REDACTED]]

28,"Joe Biden made his unsurprising announcement that Kamala Harris will be his Vice Presidential running mate.
Laura Loomer for Congress
Patriot,
Joe Biden made his unsurprising announcement that Kamala Harris will be his Vice Presidential running mate.
I’ve dealt with Kamala Harris and exposed her blatant political corruption back in 2017 as an investigative journalist.
Of course, the Mainstream Media didn’t run with the story at the time so let me tell you a bit about what I uncovered.
In October of 2016, Trump supporter and activist, Mark Feigin was arrested and charged by then California Attorney General Kamala Harris for making “criminal threats” and “annoying phone calls” to an Islamic Center.
It turns out, Feigin didn’t make the calls, but I found out who did, and I published the police interviews that took place with the real culprit.
Despite Mr. Feigin being TOTALLY cleared of the false accusations, Kamala wouldn’t stop and demanded he sign a plea agreement that required 5 years of formal probation, and community service that would be SUPERVISED BY A MUSLIM GROUP.
Kamala Harris also demanded that Mark Feigin denounce the “Alt-Right” even though he was never associated with it.
That’s right, Kamala Harris demanded a U.S. Citizen denounce beliefs after falsely charging him with a hate crime.
Kamala is the poster child of political corruption and with her elevation to the #2 most powerful Democrat in the nation, you can rest assured that AOC, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and every other power-hungry Democrat in Congress will emulate Kamala’s model to use the government against political adversaries.
And I plan on being in Congress in 2021 to stop them. Help me get there today.
We’re days away from Primary Day in Florida and my eyes are set on the General Election and meeting our fundraising goals to win in November.
We have $36,725 left to raise before Primary Day. Will you chip in $10 today and ask a friend to do the same?
Our General Election media blitz needs to be funded with a war chest to compete against my Democrat opponent and any amount you can donate will help us get there. Chip in $10, $20 or whatever you can afford.
Kamala Harris will be the new corrupt “attack dog” of the Left as Joe Biden can’t even string along a sentence and she’ll spawn a dozen wannabe’s in Congress who will be hell-bent on destroying or silencing any conservative who challenges them.
But they’ve tried that with me . . . for years.
They failed, I’m still here and they know that when they send their attack dogs after me, they’re the ones who get bitten.
Send me to Washington by donating today.
Thank you again for all that you do.
Respectfully,
Laura Loomer

Hampton Roads’ hospitals and their associated medical practices are seeing a spike in cases of the new coronavirus as the disease continues to spread.

####  Virginia apartment manager ends screening policy barring renters with minor convictions
By JEFF SOUTH, Virginia Mercury
A company that manages about 1,700 of apartments in Northern Virginia has agreed to stop automatically rejecting any applicant with a criminal conviction no matter how old or minor — a policy that fair-housing advocates said discriminated against Black and Latino renters. As a result of a lawsuit filed by Housing Opportunities Made Equal of Virginia, Kay Management Co. agreed to screen applicants primarily for felony convictions within the past five years. Under the new policy, the company can look 10 or more years into an applicant’s past only for homicides or serious sex- or drug-related crimes.

####  How COVID-19 Spread, and Was Contained, at Two Nursing Homes
By MEGAN PAULY AND MALLORY NOE-PAYNE, WCVE
Before the COVID-19 outbreak was over, almost every resident of a small nursing home in the Shenandoah Valley would contract the virus. The facility’s administrator would get it, so many staff would quit it would become a struggle to keep the facility functioning, and 22 people -- about a fifth of the residents -- would die. Meanwhile, at a nursing home just hours away in Richmond, COVID-19 patients would be kept to a single floor with dedicated staff, isolated from the rest of the population. Only 13 residents and four staff members would get the virus, and none would die.

####  In former Confederate capital, a push to honor the enslaved
By SARAH RANKIN, Associated Press
For more than 150 years, Virginia’s capital city greeted visitors with a landscape steeped in Confederate heritage and dotted with its relics, including a collection of enormous statues to rebel fighters. Tucked away, or in many cases buried, was evidence of Richmond’s pivotal role in the lucrative domestic slave trade. Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children were jailed, bought and sold in the city, and shipped across the South in the decades preceding the Civil War.

More than 40 speakers urged the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to deny the issuance of a Wetlands permit for a 217-acre site that recently was approved for a Wegmans’ Distribution Center. The Hanover County Board of Supervisors approved the project in May, but the project still requires a DEQ permit to proceed. Jaime Robb, permit manager for DEQ’s Piedmont Division, said the agency rarely denies applications although some require adjustments during the process.

Marlboro-maker Altria said Tuesday that cigarette sales continued to decline in its last quarter as the company pushed to expand sales of an alternative heated-tobacco product.

What was not discussed until near the meeting’s end — and only then was referenced indirectly with no names mentioned — was the town-wide rumor regarding the recent departure of an employee who has been accused of crimes.

Robert E. Lee committed treason when he became general of the Army of Northern Virginia in support of Southern secession. Its goal was a separate nation devoted to white supremacy and black slavery. But with the Union victory, Lee submitted to federal authority and set an example of reconciliation for a defeated South. Lee’s post-war leadership of Washington College led the faculty to ask that his name be added to the school’s masthead.
Morel is the John K. Boardman, Jr. Professor of Politics at Washington and Lee University and author of “Lincoln and the American Founding,” recently published by Southern Illinois University Press.

30,"Dear Alex,
I am Sandy Smith, the Republican nominee for Congress in North Carolina’s newly redrawn 1st Congressional district.
I am a patriot who has had it with unconstitutional lockdown orders, given by liberal Trump-hating socialist Democrats who are trying to tank the economy to hurt the President politically.
Mean-spirited left-wing partisan hack governors have been punishing ordinary citizens all across the country, for the ""crime"" of trying to feed their families and avoid losing their businesses.
Image
In Michigan, their Democrat Governor is persecuting small businesses like a 77-year old barber:
State regulators on Wednesday suspended the license of a 77-year-old Michigan barber who insisted on cutting hair despite an order to stay closed during the coronavirus pandemic.
Karl Manke has pledged to keep his shop open “until Jesus comes.” A judge declined the state’s request to shut down his shop Monday without first holding a hearing. Regulators took a different path by suspending his barber license and his shop license.
In Oregon, their governor sent Child Protective Services to harass a small business owner who tried to open in defiance of their Democrat governor's order:
Oregon Occupational Safety and Health issued a $14,000 fine to Lindsey Graham, owner of Glamor Salon in Salem, for reopening her salon May 5 in defiance of Gov. Kate Brown's stay-home order.
""I'm being threatened and intimidated and bullied daily by the government,"" Graham said during a press conference Friday. ""I'm sad that I can drive 20 minutes down the freeway, and that person's job as a hairstylist is essential, according to Kate Brown. But my job, 20 minutes up the street, is nonessential.""
""I don't want anyone to get sick. I know you guys don't want anyone to get sick,"" Graham said. ""But I also don't want to go bankrupt and lose everything I worked for and neither do you.""
She also claimed that Child Protective Services had visited her house and questioned her child. ""I've never expected such a violent, aggressive, vindictive thing could ever be done to me or my family,"" she said, ""because I'm trying to earn a living, because I'm trying to work.""
Here in North Carolina, we have another one of these abusive governors, Roy Cooper.
This guy is every bit the tinpot dictator that the governors of Michigan and Oregon are. You may recall that the Republican National Convention (which I will attend as a Trump delegate!) is in Charlotte, NC in August:
President Donald Trump this week accused North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper of “playing politics” with reopening the state, and said it would be “bad for them” if the state were to delay the start of the Republican National Convention in Charlotte.
“No, no,” Trump replied. “We’ll have a convention. I’m a traditionalist, but we’ll have to see, like everything else, but I think we’ll be in good shape by that time. We have a great state, North Carolina, that’s been very, very good.
“Although, it’s got a Democrat governor, so we have to be a little bit careful. It’s got a Democrat governor, so we have to be a little bit careful with that, because they’re playing politics. They’re playing politics, as you know, by delaying the openings. ... To me that’s politics. They think it’s a bad thing for me if they delay the opening. I think it’s bad for them. And you have people protesting outside, and those people like Trump.”
Image
Our hyper-partisan governor would cancel the RNC if he thought he could get away with it. That's how these tyrannical Democrat governors roll. I have never met anyone so lost in what he is doing. A lost socialist is very very dangerous because you combine incompetence with bad left wing policy at the same time.
I've had it with these people. It is now abundantly clear that their motives were NEVER to keep anyone safe or healthy. It's to accumulate power for themselves, punish those who work for a living to support their families, and tank the economy for the election.
I am disgusted and shocked by their actions. No red-blooded American should ever stand for tyranny, and no one should stand for political-fueled retributions, either.
If you are proud of our president, as I am, I need YOUR help urgently to defeat my high-level radical socialist Democrat opponent and retake this swing seat!
Let's send a message to the Socialist NC governor. Let's show these tyrants that they can't get away with this.
I am proud of those who are standing to fight with me. I have already been endorsed by Congressman Mark Walker, Congressman Ted Budd, and Congressman Mark Meadows. Here is a picture of me and Mark Meadows. Congressman Meadows used to be Chairman of the Freedom Caucus, and now he is the President Trump’s Chief of Staff in the White House. He “proudly endorsed” me shortly before his promotion, which I was so honored!
Image
President Trump has accomplished so much with constant pushback from the socialists, like these governors. Imagine what he can do with a supportive Congress!
It is so crucial that we take advantage of every chance we have to flip a swing district \- which North Carolina’s First District now is! They just redrew the map and took away a bunch of Democrat voters, making this district MUCH more competitive.
But this year, this district turned into a swing district. Half of the district has never been represented by Butterfield. They don’t know him, and they are Republicans!
Will you help me beat Butterfield and deprive Nancy Pelosi of a reliable vote? I need you to send $15, $35, or $250 right now so that I can meet my goal by the end of this month. This deadline is so critical, and I have no time to lose.
I will NEVER vote with Nancy Pelosi! She and her insane leftist agenda can pound sand!
Can you help me take this swing district back, with your best and immediate contribution of $15, $35, or $250? Taking out one of Pelosi’s leading lieutenants would be a major, crippling blow to the socialist anti-American left and to Nancy Pelosi’s agenda. Please rush back your supporting contribution today. Thank you.
G.K. Butterfield is a leftist extremist, not a patriot, but to replace him I really need your help. I appreciate you and thank you.
For God and Country,

But the fact is, that’s been the plan for the past three years.
CONSIDER THIS: Since President Trump took the oath of office, House Democrats have introduced legislation to impeach President Trump for colluding with Russia, for denigrating central American countries, for conflicts of [[URL REDACTED]] for criticizing NFL players who kneel during the national anthem!
Earlier this year, Committee Chairman and Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler was overheard on an Amtrak train talking about impeachment schemes. And this was 6 months before any claim of a quid pro quo with Ukraine ever surfaced. It was only a matter of time.
So what should Catholics think?
Impeachment is serious business. It involves accusing the President of a “high crime” and then acting to overturn the result of an election -- because allowing him to continue in office poses too grave a threat. For this reason, impeachment requires making a convincing public case, and backing it up with facts.
On this score, Democrats have failed miserably.
Whether you are pro-Trump, anti-Trump, never-Trump, or just tired of the hyper-partisan gamesmanship altogether, ripping apart the country with a dubious impeachment effort 11 months from an election is both unwarranted and dangerous. It will divide the country further, inflame already-heightened political tensions, and undermine the common good.
We need not detail the many ways this impeachment process has been hamfisted and tainted from the start. From its spurious origins, to its lack of transparency, its hyper-rushed and unfair process, and finally its failure to provide proof of a single crime, the whole thing leads to an obvious conclusion: this impeachment effort represents an abuse of power, carried out for political theater because of Democrats’ deep hatred of President Trump and his policies.
Is President Trump guiltless?
The President is not your typical politician. His style is confrontational and abrasive. And depending on how you interpret his call with Ukraine (which everyone can read), you could certainly claim he mismanaged his desire to clean up widespread corruption in Ukraine with the distribution of foreign aid.
But a high crime and misdemeanor? An “existential threat to the Republic?”
As Joe Biden might say: “C’mon man!”
And don’t forget the center of this controversy. Hunter Biden. A shameless corporate grifter who leveraged his father’s power as Vice President to enrich himself. Is he immune from oversight? Imagine if the tables were turned and Donald Trump Jr. were being paid millions by shady foreign corporations. We know what would happen.
The concept of impeaching a president was once considered a grave matter. Before today, it’s only happened twice in American history (Nixon would have been impeached but he resigned before it happened).
The use of the filibuster was once rare, too. Yet because of Democratic hyper-partisanship, it’s now commonplace in the Senate. And now the danger of making the power of impeachment a regular political tool has been unleashed. You can be sure, if a Democrat is elected President in the future while Republicans control Congress, he or she will face an impeachment vote.
Thankfully, this political charade will end soon.
Reports suggest Senator McConnell may move immediately to fast-track an all-but-certain vote to acquit the President and move on. We certainly hope so.
Furthermore, in the coming months the country will be offered a Democratic alternative to President Trump.
And the American people will be offered a clear choice -- on the issues that matter.
The truth is, in the end, that’s what today’s vote is all about:
November 2020.

34,"It would appear that $60 Million in bribes & dark money isn't enough for Paul to abandon his dear friend Larry Householder.
Friend,
Yesterday, while 91 members of the Ohio House voted to remove the indicted Larry Householder as Speaker, Paul Zeltwanger refused.
When faced with the chance to remove Householder as a member of the House for his crimes against the state and good people of Ohio, Paul Zeltwanger refused again.
Whether it's spreading debunked conspiracy theories about COVID-19 or turning a blind eye to the corruption of his dear friend Householder, Paul Zeltwanger has made it clear that the people of the 54th district will never be his main priority.
Let's send him home.
To that end, can you help us meet our end of the month fundraising goal by chipping in $25 today? Sending Morgan Showen to the Statehouse will bring us one step closer to restoring trust and integrity to the House.
Thanks for all that you do to make our campaign possible.

36,"homicides are up by double-digits in major cities across America this year – and it’s a wake-up call that our country can’t afford the Left’s agenda
Claudia for Congress
Friend,
This year has devastated so many communities across America, and the situation is only being made worse by Democrats who are terrified of facing the facts about their failed leadership.
We need to address what’s going on in our major cities right now.
* Homicides have risen by double-digits in 36 out of America’s 50 largest cities so far this year.
* Recent polls show that 77% of Americans are concerned about rising crime in our cities.
Democrats know why this is happening, but they’ll never admit that they’re the reason!
The Left’s radical crusade against law enforcement is taking a devastating toll on lives and communities across our country, and it will only get worse if we don’t stand up to their anti-police agenda before it’s too late.
CHIP IN TO RESTORE LAW & ORDER THIS NOVEMBER
Our men and women in blue are watching our communities fall apart right now, and they’re calling for backup from Washington – but Democrats like Anthony Brindisi refuse to answer the call!
That’s because Brindisi is more loyal to Pelosi than he is to our police departments, our district, and even the voters who supported him in 2018!
That’s why the New York State Troopers PBA just endorsed our campaign. They’re sick and tired of being abandoned by Congress, and they’re counting on us to change that.

MY CANDIDATE STATEMENT
Ronald Reagan proclaimed our country as a Beacon of Light and a Shining City on a Hill, but right now we are not reaching our potential as a country.
We need leaders with solutions. We need leaders that can relate to the struggles of everyday people. Most importantly, we need leaders that value honesty and new ideas.
I understand your struggles and I am bringing new ideas, the needed experience and a fresh perspective to the table that will help restore the American dream.
As a business owner and concerned citizen, I worry for the future of Californian families. We have high taxes, increased crime, inadequate enforcement of immigration laws and growing poverty rates.
In Orange County, rents are skyrocketing, homelessness is on the rise, and regardless of party, leaders are not acting in good faith to the great people they represent.
The last thing we need right now are more career politicians. It is time for change and I will never stop fighting on behalf of you!
I am running on a Pro-Constitution, American Family Values and Common-Sense Conservative platform. Once I am your Congressman, we will Make Orange County Great Again!
My campaign is For Our Country and For Our Future. I graciously ask for your vote in this upcoming election. I encourage you to go to my website, [[URL REDACTED]], to read my story and my platform.

Dear Patriot
It's Aliscia Andrews here, and as you know, I'm a U. S. Marine, National security expert who has worked keeping our nation safe at the border, and a mom who has seen the Left destroy this country one piece at a time.
This is a district that has been Republican for 60 out of the last 66 years and can be flipped with your support!
I’m done letting it happen. I’m fighting back with everything I have.
I’ve spent a career keeping this nation safe. Now, the Left is trying to undo all of our security by abolishing the police, abolishing law and order, and keeping our economy shackled in lockdown.
Can I count on you to join our stand against Socialism? Donate $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, or any other amount today and you can help us stop the Socialist Left from taking over!
DONATE TODAY!
There are only 28 Days left!
We have a choice—we can either choose President Trump, the side that’s beating the coronavirus or the Socialist Radical Left that wants to topple all public safety in the middle of a crime wave and a pandemic.
I’m standing with our President!
He beat the coronavirus and just left the hospital! But, not before thanking the tens of thousands of Trump supporters for coming to pray for him!
The Left lost their minds when he did this. They beat their keyboards screaming about how he isn’t really sick, endangered people, and other nonsense accusations!
If President Obama had done the exact same thing after getting sick, they would be fawning over him for his bravery.
The Fake News media is blinded by fanatical leftist hatred against our President. No President has been more mistreated by the Fake News media!
Let’s send them a strong message— let’s retire Socialist Wexton who wrongly tweeted that our President is a white supremacist!
That’s just sick!
Please donate your most generous gift today and we can stop the Socialist Left here and now! We only have 28 days and we need to keep up with Bloomberg’s spending here in the 10th!

Hi Alex,
I am Wendy Rogers, the Republican nominee for Arizona Senate. I won my primary in a rout because I am tough on illegal immigration! I am President Trump's biggest supporter on this issue... and he has stood up for us in ways no President ever has!
The President made it clear from the start: He was standing up for the American people, and he didn't care who opposed him. And I'm so glad he did!
Just this week he proposed lowering refugee admissions to the lowest level in history!
He is helping Arizona more than anyone else has:
After years of leading the world in refugee admissions, the number of refugees admitted to the U.S. has plummeted under the Trump administration.
The Trump administration proposed Wednesday that the U.S. would admit no more than 15,000 refugees in fiscal year 2021, which began Oct. 1. That is the lowest number since the refugee program began in 1980, and 3,000 fewer than the 18,000 ceiling the Trump administration set in 2020, the previous historic low.
Arizona has long been one of the main states for accepting refugees from around the world.
""The President’s proposal for refugee resettlement in Fiscal Year 2021 reflects the Administration’s continuing commitment to prioritize the safety and well-being of Americans, especially in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,"" the statement said.

His policies getting tough on immigration have directly helped Arizona. We were being overrun by illegal immigrants, drug cartels, crime, gangs, and murders- before the President took action.
Now we have stabilized our situation which allows us to deal with other problems, like COVID. He has really helped Arizona! That's why, in the Arizona Senate, I intend to push for restrictions on illegal immigration to support the President's policies and protect Arizonans from crime and drugs.
Cops are being shot. Innocent peoples' businesses and homes burnt. And they want to not be held accountable for it, by getting rid of our brave police.
Will you help me support the President's policies?
George Soros and the extreme Left are supporting my Democrat opponent. I can beat her- but I need your help!
If we are to stop Soros and Antifa, it has to be done at the polls. And that's why I need your help urgently!
Time is slipping by. Just a month to go- and the Left thinks they can take my seat. I need your help to stop them from stealing this thing!
I was one of the first 100 women to fly in the Air Force. I will not be bullied by the far Left- not now, not ever!
Voting by mail is happening here right now. I have no time to waste. I need your help urgently to get our message out!
The Far-Left and their media allies have done hit pieces on me to try to blunt my momentum. That's why I need your help to fend off these attacks!
Please, rush back your maximum donation of $15, $35, $60, $100, $250 or whatever you can afford right now help me fend off Soros and the Swamp and win this seat!

44,"Friend,
Kelly stood strong for law-and-order this week - taking several major actions to support our police officers, crack down on criminals, and bring peace back to our streets.
In major news, Kelly was the first candidate in her race to call for convicted cop killers to be sentenced to death for their crimes. Her strong stand comes just days after two sheriff's deputies – who are still recovering in the hospital – were brutally ambushed by a masked gunman in Los Angeles. As Kelly said:
""For months, the radical left’s defund the police movement has promoted violence, chaos and anarchy in cities across our country, while villainizing and attacking the brave men and women in law enforcement who risk their lives to keep us safe. Now these dangerous leftists have started putting words into violent action — targeting and brutally attacking law enforcement. That’s why today I am calling for convicted cop killers in America to be sentenced to death.""
In fact, Kelly even blasted Kamala Harris this week for her failure to denounce the ""disgusting"" display of hatred toward the injured deputies by protesters outside the hospital. She slammed Kamala for promoting a bail fund to free violent criminals - including those who are targeting our police officers on the streets. And later in the week, Kelly took action - joining her colleagues to introduce the ""Serve and Protect Act,"" which would slap offenders like the Compton gunman with a 10 years-to-life sentence for targeting law enforcement officers for assault or murder.
In addition to being recognized for her law-and-order values this week, Kelly also won praise for her pro-life positions - receiving an ""A"" rating from the Susan B. Anthony List, which has already strongly endorsed her campaign. Kelly is 100% pro-life - and will always fight against the abortion-on-demand agenda of the Left.
On top of that, Kelly took a few more principled stands this week - slamming Disney for its cozy relationship with China, and pushing back hard against Netflix's new Cuties movie for its exploitation of young children. She has led on this issue, calling for a hearing on preventing human and child trafficking.
Finally, Kelly joined President Trump at the White House for the signing of the Abraham Accords, which marked the historic normalization of relations in the Middle East. As Kelly said on the Guy Benson show this week:
""This is the fulfillment of promises made and kept by President Trump from day one. Truly historic to see the leaders from UAE and Bahrain on the stage with Netanyahu and President Trump. Truly historic and important. I mean, this is a fulfillment of the president's promise of ongoing building peace through strength ... He's delivered at every step along the way, whether it's dealing with North Korea or Iran and now bringing peace to the Middle East in this very historic and certainly Nobel-peace worthy agreement.""
Speaking of promises kept, Kelly announced this week that Accura Engineering, a Georgia-owned business, has been awarded a government contract to play a key role in constructing the border wall. Kelly is a strong proponent of President Trump's wall, and she is thrilled to see a Georgia business contribute so much to this effort.
While Kelly fights for conservative Georgia values, the same can't be said for her opponents. Doug Collins is a weak-on-crime career politician who has teamed up with radical liberal Stacey Abrams to undercut the 2nd Amendment, raise taxes on hardworking Georgians, and reduce prison time for violent criminals. Instead of fighting for Georgians, Doug spent years embracing Abrams and building close friendships with unhinged liberals like impeachment manager Hakeem Jeffries, who called Donald Trump the ""grand wizard of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.""

Jacob Blake is innocent. But that didn’t stop Kenosha police officers from shooting him 7 times in the back for no reason.
But the officers who shot Blake, leaving him paralyzed for life, still haven’t been charged with any crime -- it’s unbelievable.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are DEMANDING the officer who shot Blake be charged and held accountable for his crime, and they need EVERY good Democrat standing with them to call for IMMEDIATE justice.
Biden and Harris need 100,000 activists to sign on TODAY. Justice cannot wait. Sign your name now →

Justice must be served.
Jacob Blake was shot in front of his three small children. He spent the following days in the hospital fighting for his life. He’s paralyzed.
“Dismantling systemic racism starts with demanding justice and holding offenders accountable. Based on what I've seen, it seems the officer should be charged.”
Kamala Harris
Jacob Blake is innocent. But his innocence couldn’t protect him from the horrors of police brutality. Just like it couldn’t protect George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and countless more.
What makes this all even worse is that Kenosha cops were seen cozying up to white supremacists in the ensuing protests. Their racism runs deep.
So we’re standing with Biden and Harris to DEMAND the officer who shot Blake be charged.

47,"Meuser for Congress
Alex --
Good evening and welcome to our Week-End Update.
This week, much of the news in Washington revolved around the impeachment hearings in the U.S. Senate. Over the past months and weeks, I have detailed my feelings regarding the impeachment sham.
I believe that the Wall Street Journal’s Kimberly Strassel encapsulates many of the points I have been stressing and makes a compelling case, in her piece Crying Wolf on Impeachment against the Democratic leadership. She writes:
“The impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump is coming down to one big question: Will Democrats, by crying wolf, drown out the more legitimate Republican cry of foul? ‘Foul’ has served as the GOP’s most powerful and honest argument from the first days of these impeachment maneuverings.”
“Democrats broke every standard of due process, transparency and fairness in their House investigation, making a mockery of their constitutional duty.”
* “They hid the identity of the original accuser, denying Republicans and the country the ability to judge his motives.”
* “They held secret depositions, barring more than three-quarters of House members, as well as the press and the American public.”
* “They called 18 witnesses, but blocked the president from calling any in his defense.”
* “The White House legal team was excluded from the proceedings—prohibited from cross-examining witnesses, denied the ability to introduce any evidence that spoke to the central question of the president’s focus on Ukrainian corruption.”
* “Democrats approved two articles of impeachment that failed to identify a crime.”
The U.S. Senate rejected the call for more witnesses in the impeachment trial. House Democratic Leadership has failed to make a case for impeachment and there is no reason to call additional witnesses. It was interesting to see that the Democrats were hellbent on calling additional witnesses as long as they are not Joe or Hunter Biden. Maybe because they are like an onion, the more you peel the Bidens back, the more you cry. Thankfully for our nation, it appears this saga will be concluding in the coming days... or as the New York Post headline reads below, it's ""All Over But The Pouting.""
The President made strides in our efforts towards peace between Israel and Palestine. Peace requires compromise, but Israel cannot compromise the security of their country or its people. President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu created an agreement that balances peaceful coexistence with the need for security.
Additionally, President Trump signed the USMCA trade agreement.
This historic trade deal is another example of President Trump’s policies putting our workers, farmers, and manufacturers first.
* USMCA adds $68 billion to our economy and will create 176,000 jobs nationwide. The President signing USMCA delivers a key promise to level the playing field for our country in trade.
* Mexico and Canada are key markets for goods and agricultural products from Pennsylvania. This deal supports farmers and businesses in our district by improving their market access and is an especially great improvement for our dairy producers.
* USMCA ushers in a more balanced and fairer trading relationship for North America and is a big win for America and Pennsylvania.
I spoke on the floor of the United States House this week about the different definitions of productivity at the two ends of Pennsylvania Avenue at this point in time. At the Capitol, Democrat Leadership continues to confuse activity with accomplishment. They have spent YEARS trying to impeach and remove a duly elected president. However, at the White House, President Trump has delivered two significant victories this week... a middle east peace plan and the signing of the USMCA. Just imagine of all the energy from this impeachment was used to solve the problems of the American people. It is critical Republicans #TakeBackTheHouse
IN NEWS YOU WON’T HEAR IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA: This week, I voted against the House Democrat Leadership's attempt to further weaken our countries ability to respond to terrorists in a combat zone by stripping the President as Commander and Chief's authority to engage our military to target and eliminate terrorists or enemies of the state. This authority was effectively put to use to takeout terrorist Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Soleimani was designated a terrorist by multiple countries. This legislation is being brought to the House floor for a vote only to damage the President politically and with a blind eye to our countries safety.
The 2002 Authorization for Use MF authorizes military action to “defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq,” including against ISIS and threats directed by Iran.
Repealing the Authorization for Use of Military Force without a replacement would undermine the Iraqi government, send the wrong signal to our regional partners and allies, and embolden Iran-backed militia groups who fuel sectarian violence.
On Tuesday, we paused to observe Holocaust Remembrance Day and recognize the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We remember the survivors, those who were lost and pledge to fight anti-Semitism. #NeverAgain
We also recognized School Choice Week. Families should have the ability to choose a school that best fits their needs, child’s skills and interests. This is an opportunity to advocate for choice and celebrate public, private, parochial and all schools educating our youth for the jobs of today and tomorrow.
Today is also the beginning of Black History Month and we celebrate the lasting legacies of African Americans whose lives have shaped our nation’s history and culture. Today, black Americans have someone in the White House in President Trump who is delivering record low unemployment.
One of the most significant accomplishments of the Trump Administration has been the President’s success in making our nation energy independent. No longer are we held hostage to the Middle East as we work to ensure our nation can produce its own power to keep us all moving. As part of that effort, President Trump is working to save over 1,000 family-sustaining jobs in Pennsylvania by helping to keep the refinery in Philadelphia open. Click here to read more.
I joined other members of Congress as we received a briefing from Dr. Redfield from the Center for Disease Control, Dr. Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Kadlec from the Department of Health and Human Services, and Jonathan Fritz and Yolanda Parra from the State Department regarding the coronavirus. Their briefing provided the following information:
* At this time, the virus poses a low risk to the United States and there are only 5 confirmed cases here.
* There are 6,000 confirmed cases in China concentrated mostly in Wuhan Province. Chinese officials have severely restricted travel from Wuhan Province to contain the virus there.
* Treatments are being developed but may take a year to be fully developed. As health officials contain this virus, the U.S. CDC recommends against all nonessential travel to China.
* The CDC feels the best way to contain coronavirus is through classic public health measures such as maintaining a high level of hygiene, regularly washing your hands, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and face.
Chinese and American officials are in regular contact and we will receive updates as will the general public. I will provide future updates as I receive them. For additional information about coronavirus and how to prevent its spread, visit the CDC website.
In the District, I want to send out my congratulations and support to Lebanon County’s former District Attorney and our new State Senator Dave Arnold. Dave was sworn-in on Wednesday and will be a tremendous addition Harrisburg. Dave is a conservative and understands that smaller government and lower taxes leads to prosperity. As many of you know. Dave was diagnosed with brain cancer shortly after receiving the GOP nomination for State Senate. Dave is beating cancer and his doctors have given him an excellent prognosis. This situation highlights the strength of Dave’s family as his wife and daughter stood by his side as he battled cancer and won his election to the state senate. I look forward to working alongside Dave as we focus on making Lebanon County an even better place to live, work and raise our families.
Additionally, I want to acknowledge our new Lebanon County District Attorney Pier Hess Graf. She will be a strong voice against crime and be tenacious in her work to keep our streets safe.
As a reminder, as this is an election year, we have begun circulating petitions to run for reelection to Congress. Petition circulation begins this Tuesday, January 28th. If you would like to join our team, please let us know. For copies of petitions, questions or information regarding petition events across the District, please contact our Field Campaign Manager Rob Bresnahan at [[URL REDACTED]]
Today, we attended the Berks County GOP meeting, where I officially announced my intentions to seek another term in office. Representing the people of the 9th District is a tremendous honor and responsibility. My goal every day is to do what’s in the best interests of the families, neighborhoods and communities in our District. Berks County has always been so welcoming to our campaign and we felt it was appropriate to make our formal reelection announcement surrounding by our friends and supporters in the County. Pictured below with GOP Auditor General candidate Tim DeFoor and a younger supporter Suzannah Gillen who I gave my lapel pin.
Later, we attended the Columbia County GOP Winter Picnic. We were joined by State Senator John Gordner and State Representatives David Millard and Kurt Masser. This was a great event and there is a lot of enthusiasm for President Trump and the Republican ticket. Pictured below with Ashok & Naymesh Patel and children.
Last week, we inserted a political cartoon we thought was timely regarding the impeachment effort. This week, I have another cartoon I found that I think is appropriate considering tomorrow is Groundhog Day. Enjoy.
On Monday, I will appear on WPPA “Step up to the Mic” from 10-11 am. If you get a chance, please be sure to tune in.
Thank you and we will see you soon,

Wow, what a month!
June was Pride Month — and Ralph Norman fought to allow employers to discriminate against LGBTQ+ Americans just for being who they are.
We’ve been reckoning with the epidemic of racism against Black Americans — and Ralph Norman initially voted against making lynching a federal hate crime.
We’ve been dealing with a spike in COVID-19 infections here in South Carolina — and Ralph Norman voted against COVID-19 relief for South Carolina families.

I’ll be honest, team — I can’t find a reason not to show Ralph Norman the door.
But it’s not going to be easy, because all that energy Ralph hasn’t spent fighting for South Carolinians like you and me, he’s spent building his business in Congress and running hundreds of thousands of dollars of Facebook ads to hold on to his seat.

49,"How Color Of Change PAC was born
#  Voting While Black
Hey Friend,
#ByeAnita. In this little hashtag lies the origin story of Color Of Change PAC.
I’m Jenni, I lead the digital and communications teams for Color Of Change PAC. You don’t usually hear from me because most of my work is behind-the-scenes, but today I want to tell you our origin story, and how it's connected to re-electing Kim Foxx in 20 days.
(If you already know you support Kim Foxx, the most powerful action you can take is donating $3 to help our organizer Audrey in Chicago reach the thousands of people we need to win and continue transforming criminal justice. Otherwise, read on!)
Back in 2016, Color Of Change PAC barely existed. But over years of working on criminal justice campaigns, our team had started realizing that district attorneys, state’s attorneys, and other public prosecutors are some of the most powerful players in the justice system. They have the power to decide who gets charged with crimes and who doesn't, whether police are held accountable for harming and killing people, whether cash bail keeps poor people locked up, and so much more.
We heard about a candidate in Cook County, IL named Kim Foxx, who was challenging then-State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez. Alvarez had made national headlines for refusing for over a year to charge the police officer who shot 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times in Chicago. Kim Foxx was promising to hold officers accountable, to stop targeting Black and Latinx communities with low-level crimes, and to provide real safety and support for Cook County residents.
So I was hired (just as a short-term position back then!) to help elect Foxx, only a few weeks before the election. Back then, you seldom heard anything about prosecutor elections or the importance of showing up in them. So I sent digital ads all over Chicago informing tens of thousands of people about the upcoming election, making sure Black communities heard and recognized Kim Foxx’s name. And along with our partners on the ground, we got #ByeAnita trending all over social media.
Then that March, Election Day came around-- and Kim Foxx won! And in the last 4 years, she’s proven that fighting to elect her has been worth it. In just 4 years Kim Foxx has:
* Helped thousands of struggling people get into rehab and job programs, and provided services for students at risk of incarceration
* Cleared the names of over 1000 people with racist marijuana convictions from the War on Drugs
* Led the nation in exonerations, with 94 innocent people’s names cleared
Kim Foxx’s election was the first time that Color Of Change PAC got to actually elect a candidate who improved Black people’s lives. We were literally making our vision for our organization a reality.
Friend, my biggest fear is that if another “tough-on-crime” prosecutor is elected, all of the progress Kim Foxx has made will be destroyed. That’s why I have to ask: will you donate $3 to help us reach all the undecided voters we can in the next 20 days and convince them to vote for Kim Foxx?
I don’t want Black people in Cook County to fear being thrown in jail for struggling with addiction or mental illness or poverty.
I don’t want young people’s lives wasted behind bars for mistakes they made as children.
And I definitely don’t want to see any police officer not have to answer for killing an innocent person in the streets.
But I’ve spoken with Audrey, our organizer in Chicago, and there are still a lot of people who aren’t sure whether to vote for Kim Foxx.
We have 20 days to change their minds. Are you with us?
Yes, I want to donate to help people break the cycle of mass incarceration and live safe, thriving lives under Kim Foxx's leadership!

While many of them decried the “partisan” nature of impeachment, in the end, only the coverup was partisan. One Republican, Mitt Romney, joined every Democrat to remove Trump from office, while the rest of the Republicans voted to give Trump license to commit any crime he’d like to ensure his re-election.
We’re going to mobilize the 7 million newly eligible voters who have turned 18 since the 2016 election. And we’re going to ensure that turnout this November is #TooBigToRig. Stand with us today!

POLICY SPOTLIGHT:
FIGHTING FOR VOTING RIGHTS
I have worked hard as a legislator to protect the voting rights of all Texans, and especially for communities of color, through pushing for fair representation during redistricting, opposing discriminatory Voter ID laws, and fighting for the spirit of the Voting Rights Act. If re-elected, I will continue to fight for people’s right to vote.
Redistricting
In 2021, the Texas Legislature will take up redistricting again. Redistricting is very important because Texas has a history of illegally gerrymandering districts to suppress the voting power of communities of color.
In the 2011 redistricting cycle, I offered a redistricting amendment to substantially increase the number of majority minority Texas House districts. I testified for the Department of Justice during the Obama Presidency in Washington D.C. arguing that the Texas House District maps from 2011 were drawn to suppress the voting rights of people of color.
Voter ID Laws
I have always opposed and voted against Texas' discriminatory Voter ID laws. As a reminder, Voter ID laws address a problem that doesn’t actually exist. In order to commit the kind of voter fraud “solved” by Voter ID laws, you would have to know the name of someone registered to vote and cast your ballot for them. Voter fraud is a federal crime. Who would risk going to jail to cast a fraudulent vote? That being said, you won’t be surprised to learn that there are extremely few cases of this occurring.

Celebrating 55 Years of the Voting Rights Act (VRA)
This summer we celebrate the 56th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This landmark legislation may be one of the most impactful pieces of legislation in American History. Without it, the number of people of color in both federal and state legislatures would be much more woefully low. I would not be proudly representing District 147 without the VRA. Even President Obama said, ""I might not be . . . President had it not been for those who courageously helped to pass the Voting Rights Act.”
The VRA took a big hit in 2013 when the Supreme Court regrettably decided to essentially remove the pre-clearance portion of the VRA in Shelby County v. Holder. ""Pre-clearance"" was the process in place that used to require the Justice Department to “pre-clear” election laws passed by certain historically discriminatory states like Texas before those laws could take effect. If pre-clearance had still been on the books after 2013, we would not have had to go through a federal election cycles with discriminatory maps or Voter ID laws in place, because they would never have been approved by the Justice Department. Hopefully the inevitable increase in election laws being found to violate the VRA will restore the will of Congress to re-enact the still-useful pre-clearance requirement.

52,"Corruption is ruining our Democracy
Corruption is ruining our democracy.
Breaking: Cook Political Report Shifts Georgia Senate Race Toward Democrats
Corrupt politicians and their corporate donors use the federal government to enrich themselves — while obstructing popular policies like a New Civil Rights Act, affordable health care for every American, and ambitious investments in infrastructure and clean energy!
It's time for a new generation of leadership to clean up this mess.
That's why Democrat Jon Ossoff is running for U.S. Senate to launch an all-out attack on political corruption.
And Jon's opponent, GOP Senator David Perdue, is as crooked as they come:
* He got caught selling meetings for corporate campaign cash and taking illegal corporate campaign contributions.
* He bought stock in a company that produces medical PPE the same day the Senate received a classified briefing on COVID-19, then dumped casino shares to buy vaccine stock while the pandemic bore down on America.
* He took campaign cash from the pharmaceutical industry and then voted against importing cheaper prescription drugs from Canada.
* He traded his stocks 300% more than usual while writing the largest emergency spending bill in American history!
And in the most recent polling Jon Ossoff is beating crooked Perdue by 2%!!
Over the past few months, the people of Georgia have seen Senator Perdue for what he is — a mindless Trump sycophant with no beliefs of his own, a corporate sellout, and a self-dealing influence peddler — the poster boy of Washington corruption.
Jon Ossoff has spent his career exposing corruption and the abuse of power — holding people like David Perdue accountable.
REMEMBER: Jon Ossoff runs a business renowned for its hard-hitting investigations of corruption, organized crime, and war crimes around the world!
Now Jon is running for the U.S. Senate to expose and defeat one of the most corrupt Senators in American history, and he's already leading in the polls.
This is the beginning of a new chapter in our country's history and the beginning of the end for corrupt politicians like David Perdue.
Express Donate $5
Defeating a corrupt Senator like David Perdue and his political machine will require a huge grassroots campaign.
And we're going to need help building it!!

Trump Pence Make America Great Again
Friend,
It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
For the sake of American strength, jobs, law and order, our lives, and our liberties, we must defeat this radical duo on Election Day. The stakes have never been higher, and we need your help to send a message that this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS.
For the NEXT HOUR, all contributions will be 600%-MATCHED!
Please contribute ANY AMOUNT in the NEXT HOUR to FIGHT for President Trump and your gift will be 600%-MATCHED. >>
Fight for your Country! CONTRIBUTE $20 = $140
CONTRIBUTE $15 = $105
CONTRIBUTE $10 = $70
CONTRIBUTE $5 = $35
CONTRIBUTE ANY AMOUNT
Electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November would be a grave mistake for this Nation with irreversible consequences. They will raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators.
We cannot allow our Nation to go down that path.
President Trump and I are counting on our BEST supporters right now. Can we count on YOU to step up during this critical time?
Please contribute ANY AMOUNT IMMEDIATELY to help us WIN BIG in November and your gift will be instantly 600%-MATCHED.
Thank you,

News: Biden campaign becomes first major party presidential campaign in U.S. history to complete Hindu American issues questionnaire
For the first time, a major party presidential campaign has responded to a questionnaire posed by a Hindu American group. The Biden campaign responded to our questionnaire in its entirety. The Trump campaign deferred responding.
Full response here: [[URL REDACTED]]
Response highlights:
* Hindu students are bullied because Hinduism is misrepresented in the classroom (cites Hindu American Foundation survey) and because it is under-reported. Would recruit teachers from diverse backgrounds to teach sensitive subjects.
* Calls out hate crimes targeting Hindus.
* ""supports eliminating the limits on employment-based green cards by country, which have kept so many Indian and Hindu families in waiting too long.""
* Remove H1-B visa caps for those working in STEM fields.
* Support Hindu/Indian small business owners.
On Kashmir:
* Joe Biden will have ""no tolerance"" for terrorism in South Asia, ""cross-border or otherwise""
* Committed to work closely with India as a ""counter-terrorism partner"" & strengthen India's defense capabilities
Note: Hindu American PAC did not ask either campaign about #CAA, #Article370, or any issue internal to India - for which no U.S. administration has locus standi to comment. Hindu American PAC remains concerned that these issues were unfavorably mentioned in the campaign's Muslim American community agenda and continues to engage the Biden campaign about these issues.
The Hindu American PAC thanks the Joe Biden campaign for responding to its questionnaire in its entirety and for its engagement. If we hear from the Donald J. Trump campaign on the issues, any such communication will be shared, though the Sept. 10th deadline has elapsed. Since the Trump campaign did not respond to the questionnaire, we will refrain from offering an official endorsement for either campaign.
Please support our work with a donation \- we continue to research and endorse congressional and legislative candidates for the general election, and we will be announcing our general election endorsement list soon.
Thanks again for your support!

Donald Trump
At the RNC, Trump said he's ""done more in three years for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years.""
Let’s check the facts:
\-- He called African nations “sh*thole countries”
\-- He’s told Black Congresswomen to “go back to the crime-infested places of which they came”
\-- And he won’t do ANYTHING to stop police brutality.
So we need EVERY good Democrat to join our fight to END Trump’s racist attacks. We're $27,094 short of our goal to fuel this fight. Donate $5 to stop Trump’s racist attacks now >>
For decades, Black Americans have risked everything to fight for equality.
That fight is FAR from over.
Police are still taking innocent Black lives.
And Trump won’t do anything to help. He’ll just spew racist lies.
The President will not do the right thing unless will force him. We need $45,000 to fund our campaigns. Every dollar will go to electing Black Democrats who will stand up to Trump’s racism.
But if we miss this goal, Trump will continue to ignore us.
So please, don’t wait another minute. Rush $5 to end Trump’s racist and bigoted attacks on Black Americans >>

What’s going to happen if Trump doesn’t get reelected?
The mere thought is horrifying.
Corrupt liberals running the country...
Crime running rampant...
Our men and women in blue shamed and defunded.
Borders wide open...
Guns confiscated...
A tax burden so oppressive mainstream America will be homeless and without food to feed their families.
Health care costs will skyrocket...
The market will crash without hope for a recovery for years...
They’ll pack the Supreme Court and turn America into a socialist country.
Lady Liberty will cry and freedom and justice will be shackled.
I don’t know about you, but these liberals make me so angry I could spit fire.
Nothing but a bunch of lying, conniving, sneaky socialist pigs.
We simply can’t let them win but I’m going to be brutally honest because there’s no other way...
So here goes...
I’m petrified we’re starting to lose the battle...
You know Trump caught Covid-19. And when he did he got really behind in campaigning.
It’s not his fault, it’s not mine and it’s not yours.
But now...
It feels as if Trump’s reelection is slipping through our fingers.
And it has shaken me to the core.
We CAN’T let that happen.
You do want 4 more years of Trump, right?
If so, please sign our Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP.
President Trump needs to know how many Patriots he can count on.
Right now we’re finalizing the list of Patriots who already completed the Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP on Election Day—and we need to know you’re with us.
Please check right now to make certain you’re on the list and not left out. IN fact...
There’s no time to lose because the Official 2020 Pledge to Vote Trump is going to every Republican in Congress tomorrow morning.
Don’t be left off or left out.
We have so little time and so much to do. If Trump doesn’t pull ahead with our help and he loses...
We all lose my friend: our democracy, freedom, jobs, homes, you name [[URL REDACTED]] can kiss it all goodbye.
We’ve got to fight harder, scream louder, round up every Trump supporter we know...
Every undecided sitting on the fence...
And RISE UP.
I’m worried sick. I can’t sleep at night.
Even Ted Cruz is running scared right now.
He came right out and said it...
“I'm worried about the election. I think it's really volatile. I think it could go either way. [[URL REDACTED]] president could win by a big margin and we could win both houses of Congress, [[URL REDACTED]] could be devastating.”
I really need you to sign the Official 2020 Vote Trump Pledge then I beg you...
Give a donation of whatever you can...
When you give by midnight, check right now your donation will get 5X THE IMPACT!
$35 DONATION = 5X THE IMPACT
$50 DONATION = 5X THE IMPACT

Yep, I’ve opened up the 5X THE IMPACT campaign again because of our dire need to ramp up and roll out.
It’s lock and load time, my friend...
Time to pull out the big guns and all the stops.
Do you realize...
Your donation, no matter how big or small, could be the one the helps clinch the WIN for Trump?
The reality is...
We’re fighting a political propaganda machine with an endless stream of money funding it.
In fact, while no one was looking do you know what the Democrats did?
Secretly funneled $170 million in government grants to radical left-wing extremist groups to carry out their dirty work.
The group funding them—the Tides Center—has been flying under the radar for years...
Constantly creating new activist groups—that’s their sole mission.
These radical activist groups are the ones burning our country down.
If this doesn’t make you steamed, I don’t know what will because...
They’re using YOUR tax dollars!!!!
And they’re using them to fund radical extremist groups like Marxist Black Lives Matter Global Network...
Not to mention the Tides Center is an incubator for gun control and abortion rights.
They’re like this giant secretive dark money pit that Democrat donors throw massive amounts of money into.
Need I say more? This is as bad as I’ve ever seen it.
Not only are they using extremist groups now but...
IF Trump loses these radicals are going to overrun the country...
Is that what you want?
I sure as hell don’t.
Look my friend, the liberals and their “super snowflakes” have mega money to burn and...
They’re throwing it at the feet of any radical that will take up their cause: defeat Trump and turn America into a globalist cabal.
Senator Cruz said it best...
""There are a lot of Democrats trying to steal the election...” “The left is showing up. They're pissed off. They hate Trump. We've got to make sure everyone else shows up.”
We need you to show up NOW — not tomorrow or the next day or only on November 3 at the voting booth.
Time is running out fast.
Now I know sometimes people wonder, well what can I do besides vote?
A LOT! This election is riding on YOU, a true Patriot.
I need you to sign the Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP right now and...
Give a donation before midnight for 5X THE IMPACT.
We need it now more than ever! Please don’t let us down.
We’ve got to rally everyone to make this happen—to keep Trump in the Oval Office for another 4 years.
Remember the unimaginable horrors we’ll face if he doesn’t get reelected...
Remember how they removed God from our monuments, schools and military already under Obama? That was just phase 1.
No doubt phase 2 will be the complete eradication of God.
Bibles will be [[URL REDACTED]] of worship will be taxed, putting them out of business...probably boarded up.
That cross around your neck? It’ll become a crime to wear it.
I’m not kidding. This is the liberal horror show—their vision if the Democrats get elected.
There is SO much at stake we can’t sit by and let the liberal loons take control of our beloved country.
It’s up to us.

Yes, we know the media and pollsters lie but...
You and I can’t take it for granted that Trump is ahead either.
He’s lost ground which is why I opened up the 5X THE IMPACT campaign again.
We must keep fighting this brutal battle until Trump is officially declared a winner.
There are less than 20 days until election day.
Now is the time to ask yourself:
Are you a TRUE Patriot? If your answer is YES...
Sign the Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP right now.
Then give a donation for  5X THE IMPACT to help us get out there on the frontlines fighting this battle to the end.
$35, $50, $75, $150 or whatever you can give is great.
It’s a lot to ask in times like these, I know.
But I also know we will all be in financial ruins if Biden wins.
Every donation you give of any amount counts towards helping Trump, the underdog, WIN this election.
Your donation puts our army of Trump supporters on the phone...
...relentlessly blasting our messages across social media...
... churning out faxes and emails...
...putting boots on the ground in DC and across the country...
... organizing rallies, marches and boat parades...
Please think of what America will look like under Biden and his corrupt DemoCRAP cronies.
It’s terrifying.
How badly do you want 4 more years or Trump leading America?
Will your name be on the list of Trump’s TOP supporters going to Republican leaders tomorrow?
Pledge to VOTE TRUMP on November 3rd now.
Then give a donation from the heart—one that says “I Stand With Trump! God Bless America!”
Before you do anything else, ask yourself:
How badly do you want Trump to win?

Alex, Trump continues to abuse his power to an extent never before seen in American history:
* He refused to divest from his business interests.
* He pardoned his friends and campaign staffers for crimes they committed in his name.
* He was impeached for abusing the power of the presidency.
* And all that was before his campaign violated federal law by using the White House as the backdrop for the Republican National Convention.
These are not minor issues, they’re serious offenses that demand immediate consequences. Over a third of Americans still stand by Trump and his overreach of executive power – but with only weeks until people begin casting their ballots, we need to know you’re not one of them.

Alex,
As a former Sheriff and law enforcement official for 22 years, I firmly believe that any solutions to reduce violent crime should punish the most dangerous criminals and thugs, not law-abiding gun owners.
As Governor, I’ll continue working closely with local, state, and federal officials to further develop a comprehensive and common-sense approach that cracks down on the most dangerous criminals, strengthens witness protection, and provides law enforcement officials with facilities to deal with mental health patients and get back to protecting their communities faster — doing all while ensuring the protection of law-abiding citizens Second Amendment rights.
I have championed some of the strongest pro-Second Amendment legislation in the country and I have always been proud to receive the NRA’s highest A+ rating and endorsement.
Watch my interview with The Marc Cox Show to hear me discuss how important the Second Amendment is:

Great news! Teresa Hensley, the most recent Democratic nominee for Missouri Attorney General, has endorsed Rich Finneran in his bid to become Missouri’s next Attorney General.
Before she ran for Attorney General in 2016, Hensley spent a decade as Cass County’s top prosecutor, so she has the experience to know what qualities we need in our next Attorney General.
Here’s what she said about Rich in her endorsement:
“Rich possesses all the qualities Missourians should demand from their top law enforcement officer: experience prosecuting crimes, a passion for fair and equal justice, and a commitment to protecting the rights of all Missourians. He will be the independent watchdog we need in the Attorney General’s Office.”
Our campaign is proud to have the support of a prosecutor who deeply believes in fighting to administer justice fairly and equally and to protect the rights of all Missouri’s families.
Please join Teresa Hensley in supporting Rich’s campaign today by making a contribution of $25, $50, or whatever you can now.
We appreciate your support.

But Breonna was murdered by the Louisville Police Department at her home while sleeping. They barged in without identifying themselves to look for drugs that were never found and for a person who did not even reside in Breonna’s residence.
Breonna’s life was stolen. But the three police officers who invaded her home are STILL gainfully employed and have yet to be arrested and charged with murder.
The only person who was charged was Breonna’s boyfriend, who shot at the door in self-defense when the officers refused to identify themselves.

RELEASE
Democrat House Vote on Amnesty Wednesday Designed to Rally Felon Voters
[[URL REDACTED]]
For National Release: December 9, 2019
""ALIPAC is warning candidates, campaigns, and incumbents in Congress that Wednesday's vote on AgJobs Amnesty bill HR 5038 will be a major issue in 2020 elections where large majorities of American oppose Amnesty, and that the real purpose of the bill is for the Democrats to rally their non-citizen voters who are committing felonies by registering and voting for Democrats in 2020.""-- William Gheen, [[URL REDACTED]]
Americans for Legal Immigration Political Action Committee ([[URL REDACTED]]) activists are rapidly contacting incumbent members of Congress and GOP campaigns for public office to warn that America's legal citizens overwhelmingly oppose the AgJobs Amnesty bill HR 5038, which the Democrats have scheduled for a vote this Wednesday where the purpose of the bill is to rally Democrat non-citizen voters who are committing felonies by registering and voting in 2020.
HR 5038 is titled the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2019 and will grant Amnesty, jobs, ID, and voting rights to millions of illegal immigrants currently in the US. ALIPAC warns that passage of HR 5038 will encourage more illegal aliens to enter the US and will encourage current illegals to commit more crimes by registering and voting for Democrats in 2020.
America currently has no significant safeguards in place to prevent non-citizens, including the more than twenty million illegal aliens in the US, from registering to vote and casting ballots for Democrats in 2020, although each action is a federal felony. ALIPAC is documenting the nationwide crisis of non-citizen voters in an online list for use by activists, lawmakers, candidates, and the media. (View List on documented cases of noncitizen voters HERE)
ALIPAC contends that each ballot cast by a non-citizen is a vote stolen from an American voter and is the highest form of civil rights violation as well as a violation of Article IV (section 4) of the US Constitution which requires the ""United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion...""
""Our message to lawmakers and candidates is that the vote on Amnesty bill HR 5038 will be a major issue in the 2020 campaigns where most Americans oppose Amnesty since the elections have the greatest power to stop this Amnesty,"" said William Gheen, of ALIPAC. ""The Democrats want to use this legislation to rally their non-citizen voters who are being registered through left-wing political operations, including the new twenty million dollar voter registration campaign in swing states like North Carolina and Wisconsin funded by open-borders Amnesty advocate and Presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg.""
Democrats just passed an overhaul of the Voting Rights Act last Friday to try to protect their illegal voters and illegal campaign operations registering non-citizen voters for 2020.
They are trying to stop states like North Carolina, where ALIPAC backed state legislation that would have prevented people who say they are non-citizens to avoid jury duty from registering to vote and casting ballots. Pro-Amnesty Democrat Governor Roy Cooper vetoed the bill to protect non-citizen and illegal alien voters in swing state North Carolina!
For more information on ALIPAC's efforts to defeat Amnesty legislation in DC for an 11th time since 2004 and to stop non-citizen voters from stealing US elections and turning all states as socialist blue as California, please visit [[URL REDACTED]] .

66,"Evergreen wildfire, return to school, CO mask order, federal overreach in Portland, and hate crime in Lakewood
Dear Alex,
As we enter the dog days of summer, several things have been weighing on my mind. Chiefly, I’ve heard from a number of educators about their concerns in returning to work. I share these concerns. Quite honestly, if I were the parent of a school age child, I’m not sure what I would do. And I’m deeply concerned about the safety of educators. Combined with the necessity of parents to return to work, there is no question that this is a deeply complex issue. While legislators have no direct authority to make decisions about return dates, remote learning, and in-person safety protocols, I will be having conversations and advocating for the safety of all to the best of my ability.
The other thing that has been troubling me is that Federal agents are descending upon Portland against the objections of state and local leaders, using extreme force and detaining protestors in unmarked vehicles. This is an overreach of the Federal government, and something that should concern all of us who believe in the right to protest and also states’ rights, which were embedded in the constitution by our forefathers as a safeguard against excessive centralized power. We are watching this issue closely, and I signed onto a letter to US Attorney Jason Dunn urging him to take action to protect Colorado from such overreach.
These are interesting times. I believe we can get through them together through dialogue, compromise, creative problem solving and a lot of grace.
Click the picture above for a video from the Evergreen Chamber of Commerce where I and many others thank our brave first responders who kept the people of Evergreen safe and contained the fire!
Elephant Butte Wildfire: On July 13, the Elephant Butte wildfire was spotted in our district. It was contained, thanks to the hard work of our firefighters, and the final area it covered was around 50 acres. Ultimately, around 1,000 homes were evacuated on Monday, and though residents are now allowed back in the area, safety restrictions are still in place in a number of areas and parks. Given the location of our district, wildfires are a frequent problem, which is why I am proud to be in a position to push for stronger protective measures against wildfires and greater assistance for those who are affected by these disasters. Indeed, just this year I sponsored a bill that increases the benefits provided to firefighters like those who contained the Elephant Butte fire. I also put forward two bills that had to be cancelled due to the outbreak of COVID-19: HB20-1142, which would have created a fund to finance a grant program for wildfire mitigation projects by local governments, and HB20-1004, which would have created a grant program to provide resources to landowners for wildfire mitigation. Wildfire response and mitigation is incredibly important to our community, and I will definitely be working to address these issues next session.
Focus on Local Businesses: Our local businesses make up the backbone of our community, and I enjoy working closely with both the Conifer Chamber of Commerce and the Evergreen Chamber of Commerce—both led by strong and capable women (Melanie Swearengin and Betsy Hayes). Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, I’ve tried to work as closely as possible with these two terrific organizations to address the needs of our business community. As the impacts of the pandemic continue to strain our small businesses, I am always available to hear their concerns and to do what I can to help these businesses survive and thrive.
As a legislator, I see my job as protecting and supporting the people of Colorado. As of 2015, 48.6% of Coloradans--just over one million people--were employed by businesses with less than 100 employees. These businesses are the lifeblood of our community, and they are in danger because they are not receiving the same support from the federal government as larger, better resourced and represented corporations. That is why I am doing all that I can to protect and support small businesses in our community at the state level. One of the ways I have done this is through two bills that I have mentioned before. HB20-1413, the CLIMBER Act, establishes a $250 million public-private fund to give below market rate loans to small businesses. Similarly, SB20-222 establishes a $20 million fund using CARES money to give grants to small businesses. Together, these bills provide much-needed support for our small businesses when they need it most.
I’ll be providing information and answering questions around small business legislation next Friday, July 31 with the Conifer Chamber. Check their Facebook page or their event registration page for information on how to join the event if you’re interested in learning more.
Mask Order: As of July 16 at midnight, all people in Colorado who are 11 years or older must wear a covering over their noses and mouths when entering or moving within any public indoor space and while using or waiting to use transportation services (buses, light rail, taxis, and ride-shares). This order is in effect for 30 days, but may be extended.
Here are responses to some common questions and concerns with this order:
* Do I have to wear a mask outdoors? Not unless waiting for non-personal transportation, but it is recommended that you wear a mask whenever you cannot maintain at least 6 feet of distance from other people.
* Does this apply to _____ store? To restaurants? To houses of worship? Yes to all. Masks are required in restaurants except when you are seated at a table. Individuals officiating a religious service are not required to wear masks, but are encouraged to do so if feasible.
* Are rules more or less restrictive in my county or city? Counties and Municipalities may have authority to issue more or less restrictive rules under certain conditions. To check your local rules, look to your local public health agency.
* What will happen if I refuse to wear a mask? You will be in violation of Colorado law and are subject to civil or criminal penalties.
* What are the rules for businesses? Indoor businesses must refuse service to people who are not wearing masks and post signs at entrances instructing customers that they must wear masks. If a business does not comply with the mask order, it is at risk of losing its license.
* Can I get carbon dioxide poisoning or lowered oxygen levels from wearing a mask? According to the Mayo Clinic Health System “for many years, health care providers have worn masks for extended periods of time with no adverse health reactions ... there is no risk of hypoxia, which is lower oxygen levels, in healthy adults. Carbon dioxide will freely diffuse through your mask as you breathe.”
* What is the most recent science behind this order? Masks help those infected from spreading COVID-19 through the partial filtering of infectious particles. Meta-analysis suggests that mask use may reduce infection rates by as much as 65%. For more information on the benefits of universal mask-wearing, please look to: this editorial from the CDC, the CDC’s website, and CDPHE’s website.
Hate Crime in Lakewood: In late April, Lakhwant Singh was brutally attacked outside of the store that he co-owns. I condemn this attack, and sent a letter--signed by most of my Jefferson County legislative colleagues--to District Attorney Pete Weir expressing our full support for his office’s thorough investigation of this attack as a hate crime. Hate does not belong in our community, and I am grateful to be in a position to advocate for justice.
Senator Brittany Pettersen set up a gofundme to help pay for Mr. Singh’s medical bills from the attack. If you are able to contribute to help him and his family in their time of need, please consider doing so.
Take care, and be well!

Donald Trump
At the RNC, Trump said he's ""done more in three years for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years.""
Let’s check the facts:
\-- He called African nations “sh*thole countries”
\-- He’s told Black Congresswomen to “go back to the crime-infested places of which they came”
\-- And he won’t do ANYTHING to stop police brutality.
So we need EVERY good Democrat to join our fight to END Trump’s racist attacks. We're $27,094 short of our goal to fuel this fight. Donate $5 to stop Trump’s racist attacks now >>
For decades, Black Americans have risked everything to fight for equality.
That fight is FAR from over.
Police are still taking innocent Black lives.
And Trump won’t do anything to help. He’ll just spew racist lies.
The President will not do the right thing unless will force him. We need $45,000 to fund our campaigns. Every dollar will go to electing Black Democrats who will stand up to Trump’s racism.
But if we miss this goal, Trump will continue to ignore us.
So please, don’t wait another minute. Rush $5 to end Trump’s racist and bigoted attacks on Black Americans >>

Barack Obama: Elections matter. Voting matters.
Our country is going through dark times. But we can’t stop fighting for progress when it matters most. We can’t sit idly by while Republicans rip apart our Democracy. We have a moral obligation to fight for ourselves, our grandchildren, and our future.
That’s why we need your help! Passing Medicare for All, saving Social Security, and making Trump a one term President will take a MASSIVE increase in Democratic Voter Turnout.

DemocratsJoin us.
I'm the Democratic nominee for one of the two U.S. Senate seats in Georgia -- and we just learned Mitch McConnell’s super PAC is spending more money against me than any other Democratic Senate candidate in America.
This Senate race in Georgia is as close as it gets.
Remember, Stacey Abrams was only defeated here in 2018 by 1.4% -- running against the man who oversaw the election.
McConnell is spending tens of millions of dollars against me because I’m running to reform the corrupt system upon which he’s built his political machine -- a campaign finance system that lets insurance and drug companies, polluters, and ultra-rich political donors write the rules and exploit ordinary people.
My opponent, David Perdue, is the embodiment of that corruption. This man was busy trading medical and vaccine stocks in January and February while he assured us COVID-19 posed low risk to our health. He literally sells meetings at his home for a $7,500 check to the PAC that supports him.
We are exposing my opponent’s flagrant corruption. His campaign is sinking.
That’s why McConnell’s super PAC is spending more against me than any other Democratic U.S. Senate candidate. In Georgia.
To win in this state and overcome notorious voter suppression, we need the strongest technology, data, organizing, and voter protection infrastructure in the country. That means we need a strong effort to support me and the DNC here.
So, with this race neck and neck and so much on the line, will you split a $10 contribution between my campaign and the DNC today so we can mobilize and protect voters in Georgia and in other key states?

I’m an investigative journalist. I run a company that’s exposed corruption, organized crime, war crimes, and human rights abuses worldwide. I will bring that same passion for fighting corruption to Washington, to reform a system broken by corporate PACs, the lobbyist revolving door, and Citizens United.
Americans deserve clean government. And without reform -- as long as corporate PACs and lobbyists call the shots -- we won’t be able to ensure access to great health care, fight climate change and invest in clean energy, or protect Americans from price gouging by drug companies.
But to overcome voter suppression in Georgia, we need a strong Democratic effort from top to bottom.
That’s why I’m asking: Will you split a $10 donation between my campaign for U.S. Senate and the DNC today so we can win this crucial Senate race and seats across the country?
Thank you,
Jon

My name is Esti and I’m about to tell you my story. It touches on something very important to all of us, our identity, and how Donald Trump and the people he put in charge of the military tried to take that away from me.
When you're done reading, I hope you’ll sign our petition demanding an end to Donald Trump’s trans ban so that trans members of the military can finally be given the respect and human dignity they deserve.
Imagine constantly living in fear of being outed for your true gender identity and losing your job for living your truth. Maybe that job is supporting your entire family, maybe it’s helping you pay for school, maybe you’ve been working there for years without an issue, or maybe it’s your dream job you worked so hard to get.
Today, the Supreme Court changed that for so many people after making a monumental decision to finally extend workplace protections to the LGBTQ+ under the Civil Rights Act.
While this is a giant step forward for our community, I can’t help but think about the transgender men and women in the military who continue to be told they are unfit to serve solely because of their gender identity — including myself.
As a gender non-conforming individual formerly in the Army, I was a part of the population banned from serving due to Donald Trump’s “trans ban.” This extremely cruel, unjust order forces brave soldiers, willing to lay their life down for their country, to serve in silence, living a lie about who they were.
This cruelty didn’t start when I was banned from serving. The bigotry of intolerance against LGBTQ+ people was rooted deep within the military long before the ban. I was spat on in uniform when I returned home from a tour in Afghanistan for having Transgender and Pride flags on my backpack. I have been yelled at while in uniform to get out of a bathroom, even pulled out by the arm because that person didn’t think I belonged there, even while correctly following the state of North Carolina’s deplorable bathroom bill. And time and time again, people refuse to use my correct pronouns. These stories aren’t unique.
The stereotype of the military is dominated by a culture that centers straight white men, perpetuates the notion that others are not welcome, and contributes to hate against the LGBTQ+ community — whether they are in uniform or not. It’s forced myself and many others to remain afraid to come out, told day after day to reject and hide who they are.
I’m sharing my story, the story of so many of those still in the military facing discrimination every day, to show how serious this issue still is. Transgender soldiers have been serving for decades, and now is our moment to have our voices heard. We have the support, the passion, the drive, and the tools to be able to affect real change.
This is the time to fight for every member of the military forced to live a lie to keep their uniform.
We need you to stand with us, because the time is NOW. Make your voice heard by signing our petition demanding an end to Donald Trump’s trans ban so that trans members of the military can finally be given the respect and human dignity they deserve.
The discrimination, the brutal murders, and the hate crimes against the transgender community won’t end until we finally come together and say enough is enough. We must work together to change the dominant culture of the military that brews this injustice.
Continue to fight for the transgender soldiers still serving and the transgender veterans, like me, who are struggling to pay for transitioning surgery due to healthcare that won't cover it.
We need you. Take just a minute to stand up for this passionate, accepting community willing to by signing our petition to demand the end of Donald Trump’s trans ban.

71,"Mocking transgender Washingtonians is wrong.
I am proud that I was the first Attorney General to challenge President Trump’s transgender military ban.
Today we are in court, with our coalition partners, facing off against President Trump’s Department of Justice. We are fighting for the records that will reveal the Trump Administration’s true motives for the president’s discriminatory policy that prohibits Washingtonians from serving their country because of who they are.
Our values make our state and our country strong.
So let’s talk about Dori Monson, a local, conservative talk radio host.
Last week, Monson sent the following tweet.
“Inslee: we follow science in WA. The state where I could go to Olympia tomorrow and change my birth cert to say I was a girl on 10/2/61 HAHAHAHAHA.”
Let’s be clear — Monson is denying the scientific medical consensus that supports allowing transgender individuals to self-identify. He is openly mocking gender identity.
Transgender individuals are already disproportionately subject to depression, suicide, and hate crimes. Monson’s demeaning remarks contribute to the problem.
The people of Washington deserve better. Join me in sending a message to his employer that these transphobic comments are unacceptable.
Thank you,
Bob

72,"Friend:
This past Monday, a horrible fire devasted our unhoused residents at the Belmont and Kedzie underpass. Although no one was seriously injured or hurt, many of our residents lost all of their belongings. As the media began to publish reports and word of the fire began to spread, so many of you reached out to my office to step up and help out our vulnerable neighbors.
I want to give a special thanks to Avondale Mutual Aid for helping to organize support for the residents at the underpass and for their continued efforts to assist all of our community members in Avondale. Avondale Mutual Aid is a volunteer-driven community group that has been providing assistance to all residents in need since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. I encourage you to learn more about Avondale Mutual Aid and consider joining or donating to their efforts by visiting their Facebook: Avondale Mutual Aid. I also want to thank retired Chicago Police Sergeant Lee Bielecki and the police and fire families of Mount Greenwood, who heard about the fire and delivered a cargo van full of donations for the residents of the Belmont and Kedzie underpass Thursday evening. Lastly, I want to thank the many residents who dropped off items at the underpass and our office throughout the week. We are truly grateful for these kind acts of generosity and for the continued support for our unhoused residents.
It goes without saying that access to affordable and stable housing is key in the fight to end homelessness and to avoid tragic incidents like Monday's fire. I remain committed to supporting dedicated revenue to build housing for our unhoused neighbors. My office will continue to work with the Chicago Fire Department, Department of Family and Support Services, Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, encampment residents, and neighbors to keep our community safe.
In solidarity,

Learn about how you can be a part of helping save our Northwest Side Ash trees canopy which is at risk of dying. The North River Commission has created an initiative to preserve our city’s Ash trees which are under constant threat from a deadly pest, the Emerald Ash Borer. However, there is an affordable and effective treatment that provides up to four years of protection against infection. In 2019, after years of effectively and safely treating Ash trees, the city cut funding for the Bureau of Forestry treatment program. NRC’s treatment is effective, safe, and costs about $120 to treat a mature tree with 4 years of protection. More info here: [[URL REDACTED]]

73,"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
Trump Pence Make America Great Again
Friend,
It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
For the sake of American strength, jobs, law and order, our lives, and our liberties, we must defeat this radical duo on Election Day. The stakes have never been higher, and we need your help to send a message that this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS.
For the NEXT HOUR, all contributions will be 600%-MATCHED!
Please contribute ANY AMOUNT in the NEXT HOUR to FIGHT for President Trump and your gift will be 600%-MATCHED. >>
Fight for your Country! CONTRIBUTE $20 = $140
CONTRIBUTE $15 = $105
CONTRIBUTE $10 = $70
CONTRIBUTE $5 = $35
CONTRIBUTE ANY AMOUNT
Electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November would be a grave mistake for this Nation with irreversible consequences. They will raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators.
We cannot allow our Nation to go down that path.
President Trump and I are counting on our BEST supporters right now. Can we count on YOU to step up during this critical time?
Please contribute ANY AMOUNT IMMEDIATELY to help us WIN BIG in November and your gift will be instantly 600%-MATCHED.

Fellow Conservative,
Our FINAL Mid-Month Deadline is 3 days away, and we need it to be BIG.
Critical funds for battleground races are SEVERELY LOW and if we don’t absolutely CRUSH this deadline, Trump and his allies COULD LOSE.
That’s why we’ve activated EMERGENCY 6X-MATCHING until MIDNIGHT to make every single dollar go SIX TIMES as far. Can we count on you to step up?
Time is running out!

You know the ENORMOUS stakes of this election— and that it’s going to take every Trump patriot in America stepping up NOW if we want to save our country.
Fellow Conservative, it has never been more important to secure President Donald J. Trump a huge victory.
If we FAIL to CRUSH our FINAL MID-MONTH DEADLINE, that might not just cost us the election, it could cost us our DEMOCRACY.
Stand With Trump
We have never been closer to living in a socialist America. You see it everywhere you look. Democrats aren’t even trying to hide it anymore.
The Democrats even told us what they’re going to do:
⚠️ Defund the police.
⚠️ Raise Taxes by TRILLIONS, ruining our economic recovery and destroying 401k’s and retirement.
⚠️ Extend lockdowns indefinitely.
⚠️ Cripple private health insurance in favor of government-run health care.
⚠️ Pack the Supreme Court
If we don’t act NOW to support our President and restore Trump’s majority, the left will continue forcing their failed agenda on the lives of all AMERICANS.
Do you want to continue to live in a country where our Congress is run by a left-wing mob who denies their failed policies, evades questions that matter to Americans, and ignores the anarchy and chaos that has led to crime spikes like we’ve never seen?
If you don’t —GOOD. Do something about it.
We need all hands on deck if we want to stage the biggest upset in American history.
We need YOU, Fellow Conservative.
Make no mistake, we are the underdog going into this election, but with your help, we can pull off another HISTORIC victory.

Trump escaped impeachment simply because the GOP saved his hide.
But in the impeachment trial, we saw hard evidence that Trump obstructed justice.
So Kamala Harris, speaking as a former prosecutor, is simply trying to uphold the law. Trump is not above the law and he must be held accountable.
But charging an ex-President (even one as CORRUPT and CRIMINAL as Trump) is controversial, so we need to gauge support among informed California Democrats.

ASK MOE: POLICE REFORM IS COMING
We receive questions from voters all of the time and do our best to try to answer them. Here’s Moe’s response on policies involving police reform:
> “In the wake of the murder of George Floyd and many others, which have prompted both peaceful protests and violence in the streets across our country in recent weeks, I have been asked about police reform policies I would support.
> First, let me say that I believe this is a historic reckoning for the years and years of racial injustice. How we move forward from this moment will define who we are as a nation. We must be on the right side of history.
> As you may know, I have had many colleagues of color -- as a student at North Carolina Central University, where I earned my law degree, and as a law professor at Howard University. I have stood my whole professional life trying to fight injustice, wherever and however I encountered it. In Congress, I will do the same.
> We must change our culture and we can begin to do so by changing our laws. On the federal level, I support ending qualified immunity so that police officers can be held liable for violating the rights of people they serve. I would also push to establish a federal model policing program, adopting policies from the #8CantWait campaign that create standards of conduct and emphasize de-escalation and the use of non-lethal force. And it is long past time to make lynching a federal hate crime.
> Finally, we need to create a database to track complaints of officer misconduct, officer-involved shootings, use-of-force incidents and misuse of body cams, to begin to bring some accountability to our 18,000 police agencies across the country.
> Some of these policies are part of the House police reform bill – another effort at much needed change. And they are a good start. I look forward to continuing to improve on these when I am in Congress.
> Rest assured, change is coming. Finally.”
We will have more on this in the near future.
PRINCIPAL CHIEF SNEED JOINS MOE TALKS!
We are excited to announce that Richard G. Sneed, Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, will join Moe on Moe Talks on Thursday, July 9 at 7 p.m.
Principal Chief Sneed, a former Marine and longtime teacher, manages day-to-day operations for the 15,000-member EBCI based in the Qualla Boundary in Western North Carolina.
“I have a lot to learn about the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and what a member of Congress can do to be an effective advocate for their interests, so I’m grateful to Principal Chief Sneed for taking time to talk to me,’’ Davis said. “He and I are both military veterans and former educators, so we share a common commitment to our country and our communities.”
SAVING DACA
Imagine growing up in America, working hard to gain an education, earning a job and paying taxes like everyone else. Imagine living that American dream and then being told after doing everything right for years that you will have to move to a country you have never known because you weren't born here.
It's un-American. We are a nation of immigrants and those who were brought here as children and worked to fully contribute to our society have earned their place in it.
So we wholeheartedly support the Supreme Court decision handed down today that President Trump cannot end DACA -- Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals -- that protects these immigrants from deportation.
It is our hope, after the November election and when a new Congress is sworn in, that immigration reform will be a top priority and a path to citizenship is created for DACA recipients.
Once and for all.
ATTACKING WILDFIRES AND CLIMATE CHANGE
Wildfires are a reality for Western North Carolina, as many who were here in 2016 well know. We lost about 62,000 acres during a severe drought that fall.
We need to be better prepared for the next drought. To that end, the McDowell Community Wildfire Network has been created.
According to The McDowell News, “This is a partnership between local agencies including the city of Marion, McDowell County, Marion Fire Department, U.S. Forest Service, N.C. Forest Service, Mountain Valleys Resource Conservation and Development Council, the Nature Conservancy and others.
“The partnership was recently granted $40,000 from the Action, Implementation and Mitigation (AIM) grant program offered by an organization called Coalitions & Collaboratives, Inc. out of Lake George, Colo. This grant will support the partnership with program coordination, tracking mitigation activities, and acquiring mitigation equipment.”
You can read more about the partnership in this link, along with ways you can help prevent wildfires from damaging your home in the future.
Droughts are likely to become more common because of climate change. It is in our best interest in Western North Carolina to elect leaders who will actually listen to scientists and push for green energy and green technology to protect our environment.
We have too much to lose.
A JUNETEENTH TO REMEMBER
Last Friday was Juneteenth, the annual commemoration of the end of slavery in the United States. But this year it felt a little different, didn’t it?
There are still protests and marches in the streets across the U.S. over police violence against people of color. We are 155 years past June 19, 1865, when slavery ended in Texas, and yet there is still a need to speak out and demand equality.
So today, let’s speak out about the monuments across the country that celebrate Confederate war generals and other symbols of division. As petitions are submitted and heated arguments ensue in town halls and city councils everywhere, let’s remember on this Juneteenth what those monuments truly stand for and why they must come down.
The Confederate flag — that whole issue — was a battle to divide the country. It was a group of people that didn’t want United States. They wanted dis-United States. That was treasonous. So to have monuments glorifying this effort to divide the country, particularly knowing the message — what that conveys to a significant segment of the population — there’s just no sense in it.
This is an issue that should have been settled long ago, so it’s one that we need to settle. We ought to be focusing on issues that really matter, like getting healthcare and education. We ought to be focusing on those and not on honoring the past when that past is not something that was honorable.
So we support the efforts to remove the monuments and relocate them to an appropriate place that’s not public property.

APPLY FOR ABSENTEE BALLOT SOON
Given the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic and how it could impact voting in November, we are urging everyone in the 11th District to apply to vote by absentee ballot. You can go to this link for an application. You might want to wait until after Tuesday’s Republican runoff election to submit an application.
Voters have until Oct. 27 to request an absentee ballot, but we would recommend it be submitted well in advance so that the State Board of Elections isn’t inundated at the last minute and there isn’t any delay in getting the ballot back in time.
Reminder, you don’t have to vote by absentee ballot if you apply. But it is a great back-up if there are any disruptions and a reduction in polling locations due to the pandemic. Keep in mind that even if you apply now, you won’t actually receive an absentee ballot until September.
WE’LL KNOW OUR OPPONENT TOMORROW
The Republican runoff between Lynda Bennett and Madison Cawthorn will be held tomorrow, June 23, so we will finally know our opponent in the November election.
Not that it makes a difference. Republicans want to hold onto Mark Meadows’s old seat in Congress, and they have already spent $2 million to try to buy it even though the two candidates have no relevant experience for the job.
Don’t let them get away with it. Please.
We aren’t accepting corporate PAC money, so we need your contributions to fight for this seat.
Help us. Donate here.
Stay home. Stay safe. Stay healthy.

Sen. John Cornyn: How we can police our communities better
Reforms at the state and local levels will be the biggest drivers of change.
By John Cornyn
As published in the Dallas Morning News.
Facebook Twitter
Alternate text

Shelley Moore Capito, [[URL REDACTED]], and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., speaks at a news conference to announce a Republican police reform bill on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, June 17, 2020, in Washington.(Andrew Harnik)
The killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis was a brutal, senseless and avoidable tragedy, and one our country has witnessed countless times before. In many ways, his death was the match that ignited nationwide conversations about the racial injustices that have existed in our country for generations. These systemic problems have led to inequalities in everything from education, to health care, to housing, and while each of these must be addressed, the most important place to start is with police reforms.
In a recent poll conducted by The Washington Post and George Mason University, nearly 70% of Americans agreed that Floyd’s death was a sign of broader problems in the treatment of Black Americans by police. While there’s widespread agreement that change is needed, there’s no consensus on what that change should look like. In order to get there, it’s important to listen and learn from a variety of voices.
Over the past few weeks, I’ve teamed up with the mayors of both Dallas and Houston to host roundtable discussions with law enforcement, faith and community leaders. During our conversation in Dallas, Sheriff Marian Brown said, “We have to reach a point where we are comfortable having uncomfortable conversations.” Whether in Congress, workplaces or homes, these discussions aren’t easy, and for too long the topic has been avoided altogether. But progress can only happen if we’re having these important conversations and following up with action.
Reforms at the state and local levels will be the biggest drivers of change. This is where decisions are made about hiring, data sharing and day-to-day police activities. By and large, that’s a good thing — a one-size-fits-all rulebook would create more problems than solutions. But there are basic practices that should be standard across the board, and Congress has a responsibility to ensure all police departments are transparent, accountable and well-trained.
In the Senate, I’ve worked closely with Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., in developing the Just and Unifying Solutions to Invigorate Communities Everywhere Act to reform, retrain and restore trust in America’s police officers. This legislation helps end chokeholds and addresses no-knock warrants, two practices which — for good reason — have been brought into question by recent events. It ensures our officers receive critical de-escalation trainings, properly use body cameras, report critical data and are held accountable for mistakes. This legislation also improves minority hiring in police forces, orders a top-to-bottom review of our criminal justice system, and makes lynching a federal crime.
It takes a number of steps to deliver both immediate and lasting changes in communities across the country, and last week, the Senate took a routine procedural vote to begin working on this bill. Those voting yes – as I did – agreed to start the process of discussing, debating and amending this police reform bill. This wasn’t a vote to pass the bill, or preclude any changes, just a simple, straightforward step to get the process moving.
Unfortunately, Democrats blocked the bill. They prevented the Senate from even debating this legislation by claiming it was “inadequate.” They refused to negotiate, offer amendments, or try to engage in any meaningful or productive way. When given the opportunity to follow their calls for action with actual progress, they chose to simply vote “no.”
It was a disappointing show of priorities and a tremendous loss for our country, which is hungry for reform. Despite this setback, however, I will continue to press forward and encourage my colleagues to pass the sensible reforms we all agree are necessary.
During a roundtable discussion in Dallas a few weeks ago, Police Chief Renée Hall discussed how policing strategies over the years have created a wedge between law enforcement and their communities, and we’re going to have to work to fix it.
I don’t claim to have all the answers, but I’m confident that stonewalling the Senate will not lead to progress. Every person — regardless of skin color, political party, age or background — must be willing to do the work. This uncomfortable national conversation is long overdue, and it’s time we seize this opportunity to create real reforms. Instead of accepting “no,” it’s time to demand, “yes.”

Subject: Trump’s legal team is stacked with accused abusers and abuse enablers
Alex,
President Trump’s impeachment trial has officially started in the Senate and he’s named two new problematic lawyers to his defense team: Kenneth Starr and Alan Dershowitz.
We’re not surprised that the Abuser-in-Chief hired an all-star squad of the worst abuse enablers and accused abusers in the country. Starr and Dershowitz join Brett Kavanaugh and nearly half a dozen other accused abusers and enablers that Trump has hired, nominated, or considered for higher office.
While the Abuser-in-Chief is armoring up with accused abusers and enablers, we’re leading the charge to hold him accountable. Help us send the Trump packing in 2020 by chipping into our grassroots fund >>

Republican senators have blatantly ignored the facts and will do anything to enable Trump. Now, the Abuser-in-Chief has even more despicable allies on his side: two men who have proven they’ll do anything to protect and enable rapists.
Starr led a massive cover-up of the rape of students by football stars at Baylor and was fired. Dershowitz helped pedophile rapist Jeffrey Epstein stay out of prison while also having his own disturbing sexual abuse allegations against him.
We’re not surprised that this is the message the Abuser-in-Chief wants to send for his impeachment: abusers will always enable abusers.
Trump is staffing his legal team with the worst accused abusers and enablers in America – it’s time to fight back. Help us kick out the Abuser-in-Chief for good by donating today.

We need to win nine races to flip the Texas House
We have 22 opportunities to do so. And if we do, then we can change Texas politics for a decade.
Imagine the impact of a progressive Texas Legislature leading redistricting. That means expanding Medicaid, increasing funding for public schools, using the Texas Rainy Day Fund to help every day Texans, and more.
We can do it. Many of these seats overlap several counties so if you live in a red, blue, or purple county at the presidential level - every vote counts at the legislative level!

# More Progress
Whether Dan Patrick agrees or not, it is time to take down Confederate monuments across Texas.
This week the RNC featured one of Trump’s favorite congressmen, Dan Crenshaw. We didn’t want to hear from him, so we gave the spotlight to his progressive challenger, Sima Ladjevardian.
Gov. Abbott was right to expand early vote by a week, but now Republicans are suing to take it away. Even when they get something right, they find a way to screw it up!
There has been a 700% increase in crimes committed by White House advisors during Trump Administration. Putting him in charge for “law and order” is like asking the wolf to guard the sheep.
Progress Texas is looking for a communications intern to join our team for the fall semester. Interns will receive $15/hour and the position is remote. Apply today!

Friends,
I hope this email finds you safe and well. As you may know, SB1 is being heard in Judiciary Committee today and makes its way through more committee hearings through Wednesday, when it will tentatively begin debate on the House Floor. I am watching Judiciary on live-stream as I write you, and I am sad. The reason I am running is because of lack of representation in this District. We are currently 2hrs 10mins into this hearing and Rep Christofanelli has asked exactly two questions - both of which had been asked, and answered, at least twice before. WHAT IS HE DOING?? Here is what I would have asked:
1\. Will lifting the residency rule really bring in 142 officers before it sunsets in 3 years and is it affordable? Or will investing in the City with more affordable housing and good schools be a more proactive approach?
2\. Chief Hayden admits guns are the biggest problem, why are we not addressing gun violence?
3\. If we want to reduce crime, cutting funding to education and spending money on incarceration does not solve the problem. (This is more in line with the original call for special session on social justice reform, not violent crime - they have an agenda.)
4\. Certifying minors to be tried as adults: again, providing these services BEFORE guns/knives get into the hands of minors makes a lot of sense and will likely help reduce the school-to-prison pipeline. How can we provide these services?[[URL REDACTED]] defunding education, invest in after-school programs and ensure kids are food and housing secure.
WHY is he NOT asking the questions for you? Here's why: Republicans, in Jefferson City, are hell bent on removing an elected Circuit Attorney in Saint Louis. Saint Charles Rep. Nick Schroer (R-107) and Senator Onder (R-2) added an amendment to SB1 stating the Governor has the sole authority to remove an elected official for, ""misconduct, willful neglect of duty, corruption or incompetency"", AND after the removal of said elected official, the Governor alone shall appointed a successor to the ELECTED official. This is not how we run a democracy. Why are we choosing to be a neglected constituency? It is time for you to have a Representative that will REPRESENT you and ask the right questions, without having a special agenda.
I am very concerned with a Bill Rep. Christofanelli has introduced this special session (HB24): exempting police officer's salaries from Missouri State income tax, without providing a method of where to compensate for this lost revenue. See how that breaks down in the graphic below. I will be making a trip to Jefferson City this week to watch floor debate and ask our Rep. the questions that need to be addressed.
On a new topic: there is some disconnect with teachers, administration and parents in FHSD on the safe re-opening of the school year. With only 21 days before school is set to start, our teachers and building staff need answers. Therefore, I will be attending this evening's County Council meeting, alongside FHEA to seek guidance from the Health Department and County Executive.
Keep an eye out this week, I will be giving you updates as they come from State and local government. You can keep up on my updates by following my Facebook, twitter and emails. I look forward to keeping you informed. In the mean-time, if you have any questions, my phone is always open to you.

Chris

Devin Nunes is DELUSIONAL.
Sometimes we sincerely wonder if Devin Nunes believes the words coming out of his own mouth -- is he so far out of touch with reality that he’d paint himself as a crime fighter avenging an unfairly targeted president?

Donald Trump has been abusing his position since the first day he became president.

And enough is enough. Trump needs to be held accountable for his crimes.
But Congress will only charge Trump if it’s what the American people want.

Trump’s response to the current crisis has been HORRENDOUS. His incompetence is putting THOUSANDS of American lives in danger!
* We were THRILLED when House Democrats voted to impeach Trump.
* His crimes were ATROCIOUS!
* But we were FURIOUS when Senate Republicans voted to acquit him. They BETRAYED their duty to the Constitution and the American people.
We didn’t think it could get any worse… but we were wrong.
Now that Trump’s lack of leadership is endangering American lives, we’re polling our top supporters to see if they think Trump should be impeached again.

In 2016, he fooled far too many people into thinking he was a tough-talking success story who would “drain the swamp.” Four years later, the swamp has more snakes and he’s been revealed as a corrupt fraud.

90,"Hey Alex,
Yesterday, Patricia and Mark McCloskey were formally charged with unlawful use of a weapon after they were photographed pointing firearms at protestors. A few hours later, Missouri’s unelected Attorney General filed a brief asking the court to dismiss the case.
It is unprecedented for a sitting Attorney General to inject himself into a criminal case before the ink has even dried on the charges. Perhaps Eric Schmitt simply forgot that his office would be required to handle the appeal in this very case if there is a conviction. More likely, he decided once again it was in his own self-interest to score political points at the expense of a proper judicial process.
Prosecutors are supposed to follow the facts. But as usual, Eric Schmitt is just following the Republican playbook.
Whether or not the McCloskeys are guilty of a crime is for a court to decide, not an unelected politician like Eric Schmitt. With every move he makes, he confirms what we’ve been saying since the start of this campaign: he will always put his political ambitions over the pursuit of justice.
It’s time we had an Attorney General who is going to fix our justice system, not undermine it. If you’re with me, I need your help again now. We’re only two weeks away from the primary election, and we have the momentum to unseat Eric Schmitt. Can you chip in another $25, $50, or anything you can to help us send a message that we’re tired of Eric Schmitt wasting our tax dollars on political stunts like this?
Thanks again. I couldn’t do this without you.

Friend,
I was very disappointed today to learn Representative Ben McAdams will be voting to impeach President Donald Trump. As many of you know, I have supported President Trump on several key issues, and I have disagreed with other decisions he has made. But the choice to impeach any president is much bigger than the person who currently holds the office. We must think about the future implications of how all future presidents will be treated. We must protect the highest office in the land from a highly politicized process. Let me tell you why I do not support the impeachment of our Commander-in-Chief.

A donation to my campaign is a donation to fight against the Democrats' politically motivated attack against President Donald Trump.
First, this is the fastest impeachment proceeding in our nation’s history. The Democrats could be taking the necessary time to find out the truth first hand, but they have admittedly rushed the process to affect the upcoming election. According to their statements, they are impeaching the President to influence the election, not to get to the truth.
Second, the Democrats have failed to produce a crime. This is important because our founding document states explicitly that a high crime or misdemeanor is required to impeach a president. This requirement is not a suggestion. The Democrats want you to believe that President Trump has committed a crime bay not allowing witnesses to testify and by refusing to hand over documents to Congress. This, too, is a mischaracterization of the facts. As was stated by Professor Jonathon Turley from George Washington University of Law, a President has the right to appeal to the Supreme Court when given a subpoena from Congress. This is the right of the President, and it cannot be seen as a violation of the law. If so, it would render the third branch of government irrelevant.
Regardless of whether or not we support this President’s policies, we must protect all future Presidents from politically motivated impeachment proceedings. Today Ben McAdams failed to do just that.
Join me now to protect future Presidents from being mercilessly attacked.

CAPITOL HILL REPORT
Ask your Rep to Cosponsor Peaceful Protests Act
September 10, 2020
Pittsburgh is the latest city that has been victim to violent protests. While the left and mainstream media continually label these protests as “peaceful,” we know that’s far from the truth. These protests have led to violent confrontations, the demolition of private property, and heavy looting of cities. There’s nothing peaceful about these gatherings and they couldn’t be farther from the vision our Founding Fathers had for the First Amendment and specifically the “right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”
What’s even more maddening about these protests is that the participants seem to be immune to the COVID-19 government-mandated guidelines to which the rest of the U.S. is subject. There’s been little to no talk or even a sense of frustration towards protestors who obviously are not following 6-foot social distancing from the leftists and are most likely benefitting from the hundreds of dollars government-funded COVID unemployment assistance. Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went to a hair salon in a still “shut down” California. This simple act has left many Americans second-guessing whether or not the hair salon owner tricked Pelosi, as the Speaker claims. It sure seems like the Left lets any behavior slide that affirms their agenda, no matter how hypocritical.
Thankfully, Congressman Jim Banks (R-IN) introduced the Support Peaceful Protests Act or H.R. 8117. This legislation attempts to address the hypocrisy seen in the “peaceful” protests by holding accountable “arrested rioters who were caught committing crimes like acts of violence, looting, or vandalism to pay for the cost of federal policing of the riot and be ineligible for federal unemployment assistance.” As Congressman Banks said:
“Antifa thugs are descending on suffering communities, disrupting peaceful protests and leaving violence, looting and vandalism in their wake. They turned Milwaukee, Seattle, and Portland into warzones, and now they’re moving the chaos to Kenosha, Wisconsin. Who knows which community is next? Due to enhanced federal benefits, taxpayers are giving wages to jobless rioters that are destroying our communities. We need to cut them off from their funding and make them feel the full financial consequences of their actions.”
American taxpayers should not be funding the destruction of our communities and Eagle Forum is thankful to Congressman Banks for introducing H.R. 8117. Please check to see if your Representative is a co-sponsor of this important piece of legislation here. And if your Representative hasn’t yet joined as a cosponsor, please ask him or her to do so here.

BREAKING NEWS: Adam Schiff reports “real prospect of jail time” for Trump post‑Presidency
Do you think Donald Trump should be put on trial for his crimes after leaving office?
YES →

This is an official Progressive Turnout Project opinion poll. Please respond even if you are “Unsure”. You have 3 minutes to submit your answer.
Donald Trump has been abusing his position since the first day he became president.
He’s used his power and influence to end criminal investigations and avoid conviction.
And enough is enough. Trump needs to be held accountable for his crimes.
But Congress will only charge Trump if it’s what the American people want.
That’s why we’re issuing an urgent public opinion poll today to gauge what our top supporters think. And we really need to hear from you:

Dear Friends-
Presidential debates are about having a discussion around competing visions and plans for the country explained, deconstructed and evaluated. What we witnessed last night was the President of the United States devolving the format into a barrage of lies, interruptions, and a round-up posse directive to the Proud Boys that they were so delighted to receive, they’ve updated their logo.
After sifting through a lot of the feedback and social and the headlines today, there are some takeaways that we need your help in doing. A lot of people went to bed upset but fired up to see Trump go. Don’t miss that last part in seeing this as an organizing moment.
Because there was only one leader on the stage of last night’s Presidential debate, and that leader was Vice President Joe Biden. That leader stood up for our lives under the mismanagement of this pandemic and the economy, called out racism and fought to focus on the welfare of our families even as attacks were unleashed against his own family.
Trump had no plan, and Vice President Biden confronted him about that fact. He told a host of lies during the debate on health care, climate change, voting, and jobs but there was one moment when he finally admitted his plans to cut health care. He said outright “we’re cutting health care.” We’ve known all along that health care was on the ballot and he has just confirmed it.
The time is now for us to ensure that the folks with knots in their stomachs remember that people have already been voting in record numbers and they are cutting our way disproportionately. The goal right now is to keep turning people out, helping them to get good information on how to vote ([[URL REDACTED]]), and to keep scaling up our voter protection efforts.
Last night’s debate gave us additional fuel and urgency. We need to get our communities to vote and vote early. Trump has given the orders to a known hate group to “stand back and stand by”. They have their orders. But as Princess Philomena Desmond, who is one of the Co-Chairs of the African Diaspora for Biden, said to me today, “Our Joe struck back and he spoke directly to the people which Trump never did. But we have to be prepared for the days ahead”. Mama Philomena, I agree. So folks please read down for some of our asks.
We will send out information again next Wednesday, October 7th for the Vice Presidential debate.
In Solidarity,
Mũthoni

TALKERS MESSAGING TOPLINES
Supreme Court
TOPLINE: Justice Ginsburg’s successor will have a profound impact on every part of our lives and our future. The American people have a right to have a say who the Supreme Court Justice is. They aren’t getting that chance. We are in the middle of an election. Tens of thousands have already voted. We should wait and see what the outcome is.
* For voters, this isn’t about who is sitting on the Court, it’s about the issues that hang in the balance: health care, clean air and water, whether you make equal pay for equal work and the rights of voters, immigrants, women, and workers.
* Amy Coney Barrett has a written track record of disagreeing with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision upholding the Affordable Care Act. She critiqued Chief Justice John Roberts’ majority opinion upholding the law in 2012.
* President Trump is right now fighting in the Supreme Court to strip health coverage away from millions of people in the middle of a global health crisis. The Supreme Court has twice already upheld the Affordable Care Act as constitutional.
* If Trump succeeds and his appointment votes to scrap the entire Affordable Care Act - insurers could once again discriminate or drop coverage completely for more than 100 million people living with preexisting conditions. Including the 7 million Americans who may have lung scarring and heart damage from COVID-19.
* The majority of the American people believe the winner of the election should nominate Justice Ginsburg's successor.
* Millions of voters are already casting their ballots. They should have their voices heard on who serves on the Court.
Health Care
TOPLINE: President Trump has no health care plan - he wants to take it away. He is right now fighting in the Supreme Court to eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act If he succeeds, he will strip health coverage away from tens of millions of families and to strip away the peace of mind from more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions.
* If President Trump has his way, complications from COVID-19 will be the next deniable pre-existing conditions.
* Since he started running for President, Trump said that he will have a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act and that he’ll have a plan to protect pre-existing conditions. He’s had four years to level with the American people and put forward a plan. Now 40 days to the Election, he’s once again saying trust me - I’ll figure it out later.
* Simply put: Trump doesn’t have a plan. His only plan he has is to get re-elected.
* There is only one candidate in the race who fought shoulder to shoulder with President Obama to expand access to health care for more than 20 million Americans and to protect more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions - That’s Joe Biden. And as President, he will build on that work.
COVID-19
200,000 people are dead and 7 million are infected in the United States. We have 4% of the world population and are at 20% of the deaths. And as 1,000 Americans die every day, President Trump says, “It is what it is.” Well “it is what it is” because President Trump you are who you are.
This is the man who said it would be gone by Easter. He said it would go away when it got warm. He said it would end like a miracle. Why would you believe his promises now? Joe Biden trusts scientists. He trusts vaccines. But he does not trust Donald Trump.
TOPLINE: President Trump failed in the primary responsibility of the President: the duty to protect the safety of the American people. Even worse, he lied to the American people about the danger posed by COVID-19. Trump said he didn’t tell people the truth because he didn't want them to panic. The only person to panic was Donald Trump. He froze in the headlights, and the results were catastrophic for American families.
* 200,000 people have died, 30 million are out of work and Trump failed to do his job.
* How many families are missing a loved one at their dinner table – because of his failures?
* No President whose lies and failures have cost 200,000 Americans their lives should keep his job. Period.
* If Biden were president now, here’s what he would do:
1) Everyone in this country would be wearing a mask when around other people.
2) He’d get the testing fiasco fixed.
3) Biden would get protective gear to everyone on the front lines
4) And he’d issue guidelines for our schools and businesses, and get them aid to implement them.
* Those are four things Trump isn’t doing, and doesn’t have any intention of doing.
* Tragically, if we continue on the path Trump is on, the worst is not behind us, it’s ahead.
Park Avenue vs. Scranton
TOPLINE: Biden sees this election as Park Avenue versus Scranton. President Trump can see only as far as Wall Street, and looks down on working people. Biden will build our country back better to help working families, not the super-wealthy and corporations.
* Joe Biden knows that Wall Street bankers and CEOs didn’t build this country — the middle class and working families did — hardworking people from Scranton and Claymont, small businesses and entrepreneurs and unions built this country.
* The question for voters across the country: is the Trump economy working for YOU and YOUR FAMILY?
* President Trump has no intention of making it better for you and your family at home.
* The top 100 billionaires in America have made more than $300 billion this year.
* President Trump wants to give them a $30 billion tax break. He's going to cut their tax rate so they pay a lower rate than a working family making $65,000 a year.
* Biden is going to make the super-wealthy pay their fair share. And, he’s going to:
* Enforce “Buy American” rules – for real - so that when we spend American taxpayer dollars it’s on goods made in America -- and penalize companies that ship jobs overseas.
* Create more jobs by investing in clean energy – windmills and solar plants and electric cars.
* Raise pay for child care workers and teachers and health care workers.
* Moody’s Analytics released their analysis of both Joe Biden and President Trump’s economic plans\- or as we like to say, the Scranton plan vs. the Park Avenue plan.
* Key finding of the analysis is that Joe Biden is the jobs creator.
* Moody’s found that Biden’s plan will create 18.6 million jobs by the end of his first term -- 7 million *more* jobs than President Trump’s plan.
* Biden’s plan will grow the economy by almost $1 trillion more than Trump’s by 2024.
* Biden is the one with the strategic plan to grow our economy by investing in working families and our infrastructure. His plan will lead to higher homeownership and billions in more disposable income for American families. That’s what makes our economy healthy in the long-run.
* Trump only looks out for the super-wealthy and that doesn’t work for the economy in the long run.
President Trump’s Taxes
TOPLINE: President Trump can see only as far as Wall Street, and looks down on working people. If you make under $400,000, you will not pay a penny more in taxes when Joe Biden is president. Period. Contrast that with President Trump who now in the middle of this pandemic is proposing another tax giveaway for the wealthiest Americans.
* Trump’s tax giveaway went to the super-wealthy and corporations.
* 83% of the benefits will ultimately go to the top 1% and 40% of the benefits went to foreign investors.
* 91 Fortune 500 companies paid no federal taxes last year.
* The top 100 billionaires in America have made more than $300 billion this year. Donald Trump wants to give them a $30 billion tax break -- in the middle of a pandemic and an economic crisis.
* $30 billion more, just for those 100 folks. Trump is going to cut the super wealthy’s tax rate so they pay a lower rate than a working family making $65,000 a year.
* Joe Biden will make the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share, and invest that revenue in the middle class and growing our economy - expanding access to affordable health care, making community college tuition-free, investing in our public schools, repairing our roads and bridges, and more.
* Joe Biden is proposing tax cuts for working families:
* As long as the COVID crisis rages, he will expand the Child Tax Credit to help families. That means a firefighter with three teenagers will receive an additional $3,000 -- or $9,000 total.
* He’ll expand tax credits for child care, which could mean up to $6,800 in additional tax relief each year for such families.
* He’ll give first-time homebuyers a $15,000 advanceable tax credit for their down payment.
* And, he’ll increase tax credits to lower health care premiums, too.
Donald Trump and Race
Trump had multiple chances to say he disowned white supremacy. He refused. Donald Trump fans the flame of white supremacy and racism. It’s his only political strategy.
Equity, equality, and justice – the American creed. We have never lived up to it; but we’ve never stopped trying until this President.
Joe Biden got into this race because of Charlottesville. After seeing hate-filled men with torches spilled out of the woods spewing racism and anti-Semitic bile, Donald Trump said there were “very fine people on both sides.” Those words shocked our conscience and stunned the world.
This summer, after George Floyd was killed, President Trump hid in the White House bunker. Then he ordered force against peaceful protestors outside the White House, gassing Americans to stage a photo op of him holding a Bible outside a church.
1 in 1000 African Americans has been killed by COVID-19, and if Trump doesn't do something fast by the end of year, it will be 1 in 500. This man has done virtually nothing for Black Americans.
TOPLINE: President Trump turns Americans against each other and fuels toxic racism for his own political gain. He has no desire to unite Americans to move our country forward. Division is his primary political strategy. It’s wrong, and it’s not who we are as a country.
* After neo Nazis and white supremacists marched in Charlottesville, he said there were “very fine people on both sides.”
* Following the tragic murder of George Floyd, as millions of Americans stood up for healing and justice, Trump actively fanned hate and even encouraged violence.
* Hate crimes have surged on his watch, he has admitted that he’s trying to keep Black Americans from exercising their sacred right to vote, slandered the Latino community, sought to bar Muslims from even entering the United States, presided over a spike in anti-Semitism, and regularly tries to scapegoat fellow Americans as “the other” in order to distract from his massive failures.
Law and Order with Justice
TOPLINE: Law and order with justice - where everyone is treated fairly. Donald Trump isn’t a law and order president. He’s a president who breaks the law and creates disorder. Joe Biden has condemned violence in every form it takes – while President Trump has failed to stand up to his own supporters and unequivocally condemn violence. Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is reelected?
* When President Trump says, “You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America,” he’s talking about what’s happening in President Trump’s America.
* President Trump failed to protect America so now he is trying to scare America.
* He owns this chaos yet proudly touts himself as a ‘law and order’ president.
* When President Trump says “you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America”, look around at President Trump’s America:
* COVID runs unchecked throughout the country and has killed thousands while sending our economy spiraling.
* The murder rate is up 26% in cities across the nation under Donald Trump.
* More cops have died of COVID-19 this year than on patrol.
* President Trump continues to fan the flames of division and encourage chaos.
* We must stand against violence – in every form it takes:
* The violence of unwarranted police shootings, excessive force, of extremists, and more.
* The senseless violence of looting and burning and destruction of property.
* When President Trump looks at this violence and sees a political lifeline. Joe Biden is offering a different vision. He’s going to bring Americans together to address the challenges our country faces.
Climate Change
When Donald Trump thinks of climate he thinks “hoax”. When Joe Biden thinks of climate change, he thinks jobs- good paying union jobs.
And Joe Biden will rejoin the Paris Climate Accord because without us it’s falling apart. He’ll host a summit for the world’s leading emitters in his first 100 days, and persuade them to up the ante, and increase their emissions goals.
TOPLINE:
* As a nation, we face one of the most difficult moments in our history. Four historic crises. COVID, the economy, racial justice and climate change - all at the same time.
* Once again, President Trump fails the most basic duty to this nation -- he fails to protect us. We are not safe in President Trump’s America.
* Wildfires are burning the suburbs in the West. Floods are wiping out suburban neighborhoods in the Midwest. And, hurricanes are imperiling suburban life along our coasts. The impacts of climate change don't pick and choose red states or blue states.
* Which makes President Trump’s climate denialism — his disdain of science and facts — all the more confounding.
* The unrelenting impact of climate change affects every single one of us. But too often the brunt falls disproportionately on communities of color, exacerbating the need for environmental justice.
* Every American has a fundamental right to breathe clean air and drink clean water.
* Our economy can’t recover if we don’t build back with more resiliency to withstand extreme weather that will only come with more frequency.
* When President Trump thinks of climate change, he thinks hoax. When Joe Biden thinks of climate change, he thinks jobs - good paying union jobs.
* We need a president who respects science, who understands that the damage from climate change is already here, and, unless we take urgent action, will soon be more catastrophic. A president who recognizes, understands, and cares that Americans are dying.
* As President, Biden will send Congress in the first 100 Days a sweeping plan for a clean-energy revolution:
* Build a 100%-clean-energy economy – creating millions of jobs to power our recovery.
* Invest record amounts in research and innovation – more than we spent to put a man on the moon.
* Build a more resilient infrastructure, more efficient power grid, and 500,000 public charging stations for electric cars.
Voting
President Trump is using scare tactics to undermine voting-by-mail. But the truth is: Trump himself just voted-by-mail in Florida’s primary, and his campaign is promoting it for its own supporters.
Our military has been voting by mail since the Civil War.
Joe Biden refuses to let Donald Trump undermine faith in our democracy.
If President Trump says he won't accept the results of the election it doesn't matter. If we get the votes, he has to go.
The American people have it in our power to determine what’s going to happen and if we want four more years of these lies.
Go to [[URL REDACTED]] right now to make a plan to vote early.
TOPLINE: The American people are going to vote and determine the next President of the United States.
* The Biden campaign has launched the biggest voter protection program in history: thousands of staff on the ground, lawyers, and poll watchers throughout the states to ensure every eligible voter who wants to can do so.
* The campaign is aggressively answering efforts by Trump and his allies here at home and overseas to suppress voting.
* This includes:
* State programs-- recruiting and ensuring poll workers and safe polling locations.
* Anti-voter suppression programs-- preventing Republicans from putting up obstacles to voting and from using supposed emergency powers to intimidate voters and attack or subvert our democratic processes.
* Voter registration and education programs-- registering voters, and ensuring they have the information they need to vote by mail or in person.
* Guarding against foreign interference and cyberattacks-- protecting against abuse of platforms and voter misinformation from domestic and foreign sources.

Friend,
Joe Biden is our pick for president -- and we need him now more than EVER!
But as the November election approaches, we want to know, friend:
Would you vote for a Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ticket?
Take our live poll NOW:
As you know, Joe Biden has pledged to select a woman as his Vice President. We 100% agree!
And California’s own Senator Kamala Harris is a ROCKSTAR. She led the charge against the confirmation of Bill Barr, has authored a bill to make lynching a federal hate crime and has been a LIFELONG ally and champion for our LGBTQ+ community. As California’s attorney general, she worked with Equality California to OUTLAW the so-called “gay and trans panic” defense, which allowed defendants to blame their anti-LGBTQ+ attacks on the victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity.
So, we want to know, would you vote for a Joe Biden/Kamala Harris ticket this November? Take our LIVE poll right now >>
Joe could make his VP announcement ANY DAY NOW. Tell us ASAP if you would support a Biden/Harris ticket:

DAN CRENSHAW FOR CONGRESS
Alex -
Texas vs California. Good governance vs bad governance.
This is what’s at stake in November. Click here or on the image above to watch and share this with your friends.
Democrats are spending millions to flip the Texas State House, and our State Rep candidates desperately need help. It’s an emergency. Our prosperity is on the line.
Associated Republicans of Texas is working hard to support these candidates. Please chip in ANY AMOUNT IMMEDIATELY to help them GET OUT THE VOTE.
CHIP IN TO SAVE TEXAS
In Service,
Dan Crenshaw
FULL TRANSCRIPT
What makes for good governance?
Safe communities, Less regulations, lower taxes, and minimal interference from government - Giving people the freedom to make their own choices.
And what does bad governance look like?
Defunding the police, refusing to enforce the law, more regulations, higher taxes, and a government-knows-best attitude.
Don’t believe me? Well lets compare a large state run by Democrats, California, to a large state run by Republicans, Texas.
California, a beautiful state with millions of hardworking Americans. California rose to prosperity under Republican governance, but in recent decades it has been devastated by one party, Democrat rule. An unemployment rate of more than 11% - one of the highest in the country. The 4th highest electricity prices in the country. Rolling blackouts, forest fires, rising crime and homelessness.
The Tax Foundation ranks California 48th in terms of business climate. California is also ranked 48th in terms of regulatory burdens. And California’s cost of living is 50 percent higher than the national average.
Now, people are fleeing the state in droves. Businesses are closing down by the thousands. Jobs are leaving the state in record numbers.
In just 2018 and 2019—economic boom years—765 commercial facilities left California. Large companies like Toyota, Charles Schwab, and Jamba Juice.
An estimated 13,000 businesses left between 2008 and 2016. 275,000 jobs left the state and $76 billion in capital funds were diverted during the same period.
And where are these jobs fleeing to? Texas.
More than 86,000 people moved to Texas from California in 2018 alone. A U-Haul from Los Angeles to Houston costs more than $2,000. A U-Haul from Houston to Los Angeles costs $600.
The reason is simple. We have smart policies that work. We empower people instead of trying to control them.
Texas has no personal income tax. Our unemployment rate is just half of California’s even though our COVID trends were similar. Texas has some of the lowest electricity prices in the country. Texas is the best state in America to start a new business, according to studies.
We also treat the environment better. We are a leader in energy innovation and wind power, and our emphasis on private land ownership makes it much easier to manage forests and prevent wildfires.
So you have to ask yourself, why switch form good governance to bad governance?
Millions of dollars are flooding into Texas to make our state more like California. They’re trying to “Turn Texas Blue” and they won’t stop until they control our state legislature, control the Governor’s mansion, and flip our U.S. House and Senate Seats.
We have to stop them.
The front line of this defense to save Texas is the Texas State House, and we have incredible young, diverse candidates that need our help as they fight against millions of dollars of out-of-state donations from the likes of far-left billionaires like Mike Bloomberg and George Soros.
We need to keep Texas prosperous. We need to Keep Texas free. We need to keep Texas REPUBLICAN.
When you donate to Associated Republicans of Texas, you donate to a one stop shop for saving the Texas State House. We need your help. Its all on the line. Donate today, save Texas.
