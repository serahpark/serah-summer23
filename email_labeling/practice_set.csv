1,"Friend,
Kelly had another strong week, building tremendous momentum and closing out her All About Georgia Recess Tour by visiting with hundreds of Georgians from all over the state. On Monday, Kelly was joined by Governor Brian Kemp and Georgia First Lady Marty Kemp in Savannah, and then she finished the day in Dalton. On Tuesday, Kelly rolled out an all-star line-up of statewide elected officials to stump for her in Muscogee, Carroll and Fayette Counties.
Click the photo below to see a video message from Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, Attorney General Chris Carr, Insurance Commissioner John King and Public Service Commissioner Tim Echols encouraging voters to join them in supporting Kelly:
On Wednesday, Kelly was again joined by Governor Kemp, this time in Peachtree Corners, for a HUGE rally with a great group of supporters. On Thursday, U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) joined Kelly for her campaign stops in Gilmer, Forsyth and Hall Counties, explaining why Kelly is the tough-on-crime, tough-on-China, no-nonsense conservative Georgia needs in Washington.
In case you missed it, the Radical Left crashed Kelly's event in Forsyth County, opting for screaming and yelling instead of productive dialogue and a helpful exchange of ideas. This display perfectly explains the Left's vision for America: to silence anyone they disagree with. But Kelly will not be silenced. She will always fight for everyday Georgians and push back against this out-of-control cancel culture.
Click the photo below to see footage:
In addition to her tour, Kelly also stood up for conservative values on and off the campaign trail. On Monday, she slammed liberal puppet Raphael Warnock for twisting the gospel to justify the Left's immoral abortion-on-demand agenda. Kelly also condemned left-wing hypocrite Nancy Pelosi for her trip to the salon while everyday Americans are not afforded such a luxury. In a Breitbart op-ed, Kelly further denounced the BLM political organization, especially its anti-moms-and-dads agenda to destroy the nuclear family. She re-affirmed her rock-solid commitment to the men and women of law enforcement.
Finally, she continued to expose career politician Doug Collins for his 300+ votes with ""good friend"" Stacey Abrams and his votes for gun control, lighter sentences for violent criminals and his support for the ""largest tax increase in Georgia history.""
For daily and hourly updates, please be sure to follow Kelly on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

JUSTICE FOR BREONNA TAYLOR: DEMAND THE INVADING OFFICERS ARE CHARGED WITH MURDER ➞
We need you to remember this name: Breonna Taylor.
Breonna Taylor was an award-winning EMT and First Responder from Louisville, KY who risked her own health and safety to serve her community during Covid-19. Her life mattered.
Breonna Taylor
But last month, Breonna was murdered by the Louisville Police Department at her home while sleeping. They barged in without identifying themselves to look for drugs that were never found and for a person who did not even reside in Breonna’s residence.
Breonna’s life was stolen. But the three police officers who invaded her home are STILL gainfully employed and have yet to be arrested and charged with murder.
The only person who was charged was Breonna’s boyfriend, who shot at the door in self-defense when the officers refused to identify themselves.
We’re beyond disgusted at this horrific disregard for Black life. So we’re calling for justice.
We won’t rest until these offenders are held accountable for their crime. Sign on to demand the invading officers are charged with the murder of Breonna Taylor →
JUSTICE FOR BREONNA TAYLOR: DEMAND THE INVADING OFFICERS ARE CHARGED WITH MURDER ➞
Black Americans, especially Black essential workers like Breonna, deserve the right to sleep peacefully in their own home, free from harm.
This is an injustice that cannot be ignored. And it will take an army of grassroots activists like you, to finally be taken seriously by Kentucky State Officials.

Dear Friends,
Let’s face it – some days it feels like we’re more divided than ever.
In this time of great strife, when we should all be coming together as one America, we’ve instead seen increasingly stark examples of bigotry and close-mindedness across the country.
I’m sad to say that, even in our close-knit community, this kind of hate and division has become all too common.
Just recently, we saw two separate, ugly incidents in our district that were motivated by blatant racism and anti-Semitism.***
With hate crimes on the rise and our national dialogue turning to one on confronting our long relationship with racism, I was shocked to see my opponent recently vote against a bill that would teach our children about symbols of hate and how to challenge such bigotry.
At this place in history, can we afford to be represented by someone who isn’t ready to meet this moment?
We need leadership for the 4th District that is willing to have the tough conversations and take a stand in order to tell everyone who lives here that they belong and are welcome here.
Let’s send a message in November that this is not who we are and not what our district stands for.
If you are able to support our campaign with a contribution, we’d greatly appreciate it.
As I’ve said before, this campaign is all about standing up to do-nothing politicians, protecting the most vulnerable among us, and showcasing the ideas and convictions that prioritize ALL of our Long Island families.
Join us. Donate today.
Thank you for everything,
Christine

RELIGIOUS FREEDOM The Justice Department said that New York City cannot enforce coronavirus restrictions strictly on religious gatherings while allowing massive public protests. “New York City had vigorously enforced restrictions on religious gatherings, including by sending police officers to disperse numerous gatherings of the Jewish community, including outdoor funerals,” said Justice Department officials. “At the same time, Mayor de Blasio marched in large in-person political gatherings concerning the recent tragic death of George Floyd.” The Justice Department said it was “glad” that Mayor de Blasio will permit greater religious exercise.

An FBI investigation, however, determined that no hate crime was committed and that the rope had been installed months before it was ever assigned to Wallace. Sports commentator Clay Travis said: “The 'noose' in question in Bubba Wallace’s garage was a rope handle with a loop to pull down the garage door.” READ

Chip in $5 to defeat homophobia >>
That’s right, Donald Trump and Mike Pence aren’t the only anti-LGBTQ+ extremists on the ballot this year. Michelle Steel is running against pro-equality champion Rep. Harley Rouda in one of the most competitive races in the country!
If this is how Michelle Steel treats her own family -- sending her daughter away for “one year of brainwash” -- imagine how she’d treat her LGBTQ+ constituents!
Please, we need your help. Chip in now to help defeat homophobia at the ballot box >>
Chip in $5 immediately >>
Chip in $35 immediately >>
Chip in $50 immediately >>
Chip in $100 immediately >>
Chip in $250 immediately >>
Chip in another amount immediately >>
When Harley Rouda got to Congress last year, the FIRST thing he did was cosponsor the Equality Act, which would provide civil rights protections to all LGBTQ+ Americans. Then, he helped pass the Equality Act through the House for the first time in history.
Michelle Steel, on the other hand, has a long history of opposing LGBTQ+ civil rights -- she even voted to block the release of a report about anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes on the Orange County Board of Supervisors!
Orange County families deserve a representative who will fight to protect our civil rights — not someone who thinks LGBTQ+ people are second-class citizens. We can’t afford to let anti-LGBTQ+ extremists like Michelle Steel beat pro-equality champions like Harley Rouda this November.
We need your help to defeat Michelle Steel’s tired brand of homophobia, friend. Will you chip in $5 or more RIGHT NOW to help us defeat anti-LGBTQ+ extremists at the ballot box this November? >>

Patriot,
With all their guns aimed at Tucker Carlson, you’d think the radical Left would have their hands full.
But no…
They’ve now turned their guns ALSO on Sean Hannity in hopes they can kill two birds with one socialist stone.
Ever since Donald Trump won on election night in 2016, Barack Obama’s political network has been in socialist revolution mode.
And Hannity has called them out on it!
That’s why they hate him so much…he’s exposing their lies, corruption and Deep State collusion against President Trump.
We're rallying the Tea Party troops to launch our counter-revolution against the radical Left to circle the wagons for Hannity...
…because they just ESCALATED their plan to take him out, too.
##  SIGN THE PETITION:
DEFEND HANNITY!
Just this week Hannity called out the radical leftist Democrats for their failed leadership:
> ""We have Pelosi. We have Schumer. We have Biden. 125 years of swamp failure. They have done nothing to quell inner-city violent crime anywhere in America, nothing to fix the broken dilapidated disgusting and repulsive educational system. They have failed America's children. We have far left mayors. They have ruled these cities for decades. They have completely failed their citizens.""
They HATE Hannity for exposing the truth!
So in order to shut him up, they’ve launched a scandalous — completely bogus — lawsuit against both Hannity and Tucker...
…they recruited a disgruntled former employee to make scurrilous claims of harassment at Fox News…which “have no basis in fact whatsoever.""
But the truth has never gotten in the way of the radical Left’s plan to entirely destroy conservative patriots and remove them from the airways!
The problem is, if we don’t step up and defend Hannity alongside our defense of Tucker, it’s only a matter of time before they prevail!
If you think this is just fear-mongering, think again. This is EXACTLY how they took down Bill O’Reilly!
With O’Reilly’s head on a proverbial pike, they’re foaming at the mouth to lop off Hannity’s head, too.
If we lose Hannity’s critical voice, cutting through lies and deception from the Left, President Trump’s ability to counteract the fake news media will be severely muted ahead of November.
That's why I need you to sign Hannity's petition right now and join the counter-revolution to keep him on the air. Will you sign?

CEO, [[URL REDACTED]]

We need to win nine races to flip the Texas House
We have 22 opportunities to do so. And if we do, then we can change Texas politics for a decade.
Imagine the impact of a progressive Texas Legislature leading redistricting. That means expanding Medicaid, increasing funding for public schools, using the Texas Rainy Day Fund to help every day Texans, and more.
We can do it. Many of these seats overlap several counties so if you live in a red, blue, or purple county at the presidential level - every vote counts at the legislative level!

# More Progress
Whether Dan Patrick agrees or not, it is time to take down Confederate monuments across Texas.
This week the RNC featured one of Trump’s favorite congressmen, Dan Crenshaw. We didn’t want to hear from him, so we gave the spotlight to his progressive challenger, Sima Ladjevardian.
Gov. Abbott was right to expand early vote by a week, but now Republicans are suing to take it away. Even when they get something right, they find a way to screw it up!
There has been a 700% increase in crimes committed by White House advisors during Trump Administration. Putting him in charge for “law and order” is like asking the wolf to guard the sheep.

### VISUALIZATION: SPIKE IN DEMOCRAT-SPONSORED LEGISLATOIN
The Virginia Public Access Project
In the Virginia legislature, the proportion of Republican- and Democrat-sponsored bills introduced each year has roughly mirrored the number of seats each party held. This year, Democrats -- who regained control of both chambers for the first time in two decades -- have introduced more than their share of bills.
### VISUALIZATION: LEGISLATURE IS JUST CRANKING UP
The Virginia Public Access Project
The first two weeks of the General Assembly session are always the slowest as committees get organized and begin to review legislation. VPAP compares the number of bills referred from House and Senate committees in the first two weeks with the number of measures referred in recent years following an election.

By DAVE RESS, Daily Press (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month)
A bill that bans the kind of online loans that hit Virginians with interest rates sometimes exceeding 900% passed a key first hurdle in the General Assembly on Thursday. The legislation targeting the online firms also would slash charges levied for payday, car title and other short-term loans.
### NEW GAME IN TOWN: BILL WOULD ALLOW SLOT MACHINES IN RESTAURANTS, CONVENIENCE STORES IN VIRGINIA
By MICHAEL MARTZ, Richmond Times-Dispatch (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month)
Virginia would open the door for state-regulated slot machines under a new legislative proposal that would end the legal distinction between games of skill and chance. Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, chairman of a Senate subcommittee on gaming, introduced a new proposal on Thursday that would turn the debate over electronic gaming machines on its head.

By DAVE RESS, Daily Press (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month)
Some two and half decades after tough-on-crime laws sailed through a General Assembly alarmed by tales of “wilding” teenagers, a sweeping rethinking of how to deal with kids accused of felonies is headed on its way into law. A bill that gives judges discretion about when to send 14- and 15-year-olds to adult court to be tried for violent felonies passed the House of Delegates’ Criminal Law subcommittee, a panel that has long been skeptical of reform.
