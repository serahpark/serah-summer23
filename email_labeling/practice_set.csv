0,"Watching President Trump and Joe Biden ""debate"" each other is mind numbing...
circle-cropped \(4\)
Here are my post debate thoughts on Trump and Biden:
Alex -- Watching President Trump and Joe Biden ""debate"" each other is mind numbing... but I do want to share my thoughts on what was discussed this evening.
Before I share my thoughts - During the last debate our campaign raised over $100,000 in 24 hours and EXPLODED with new supporters. Can we do it again? Please click here to donate $20.20, $50, $100, $250 or any amount.
The economy, lockdowns, and COVID19:
Biden is doing everything he can to place the blame on President Trump. In turn, Trump is attempting to blame Biden and the Democrats for destroying the economy by forcing businesses to shut down.
The reality?
These lockdowns have been a bipartisan disaster.
We have lost THOUSANDS of businesses and MILLIONS for jobs because of the actions taken by politicians willing to tear up the Constitution during a crisis.
As President, I would re-open our economy and unleash the free market to create solutions for viruses such as COVID19.
Foreign governments and backroom deals:
I can't pretend to know all the details of the back room deals President Trump and Joe Biden make.
However, I do know these men have a history of making shady deals and are well connected with the global elite.
I don't trust either of them with our economy, taxpayer money, or to act ethically in the White House.
Healthcare:
We will NEVER achieve victory on healthcare reform until we adopt free market solutions. We can dramatically reduce the cost of healthcare by reducing regulations, FULLY repealing Obamacare, and embracing innovation.
Criminal Justice Reform:
Neither of these men are qualified to speak about criminal justice reform. Biden enacted the 1994 crime bill and Trump has DONE nothing to end the War on Drugs.
As President, I would pardon non-violent drug offenders, seek to end qualified immunity, and stop arming police departments with weapons from the Pentagon.
Climate Change:
I am the only candidate proposing a solution that will cut our CO2 gas emissions rapidly... nuclear power.
We need to unleash the free market to solve environmental issues. Not the government!
Post Debate Call-To-Action:
During the last debate, our website traffic blew up, Google searches for our campaign reached record highs, voter pledges flooded in, and new donors. We even raised over $100,000 in 24 hours.
Americans are searching for another candidate to vote for. We MUST reach them during this critical window of opportunity and earn their vote.

'Ethics Watchdog Accuses Trump Officials Of 15 Hatch Act Violations During Conventions' - Forbes
Look, Trump's corruption knows no limit. He's abusing his power to win re-election. If we don't stop him, Joe Biden will lose!
So we're collecting 60,000 signatures to demand Congress investigate the Trump's Hatch Act violations. Sign on now →
SIGN MY NAME ➞
Trump's corruption was on full display at the RNC:
[1] He broke campaign laws by giving his RNC speech from the White House
[2] The GOP tricked non-supporters into appearing in propaganda videos
[3] They manipulated new Americans' citizenship oaths into a political stunt
Trump's actions are BLATANT violations of the Hatch Act, which forbids federal employees from using their power for political gain.
We've had ENOUGH. Click the button to sign the petition and force Congress to investigate Trump's crimes →
SIGN MY NAME ➞
Trump isn't the only offender of the Hatch Act -- his GOP cronies break the law all the time to get ahead:
\-- Kelly Anne Conway promotes Ivanka Trump's clothing line on live television.
\-- Jared Kushner used his title to fundraise for Trump's campaign.
\-- And Ivanka Trump tweeted a PROMOTION for canned beans?!
It's despicable. It's unethical. AND IT'S ILLEGAL. They MUST be held accountable for their actions.
That's why we need you to take action today to call for an investigation:

2,"Hi there,
I’m collecting signatures from Florida Democrats to demand William Barr resign as Attorney General.
The Attorney General is supposed to work on behalf of the American People.
But William Barr works solely to benefit Trump!
He’s one of the most crooked Attorney Generals we’ve ever had, so I need you to sign our petition to demand his resignation.
Click HERE to add your name >>
(I only need 18 more signatures from Bryceville)
Barr just intervened in the sentencing of one of Trump’s closest campaign strategists: Roger Stone.
Career prosecutors recommended that Stone go to jail for 7-9 years for crimes he committed during the 2016 Presidential Election.
But William Barr intervened after Trump tweeted about how “unfair” it was.
This isn’t a movie. This isn’t an autocracy. The Attorney General must have forgotten that this is the United States, and we respect justice.
If you agree that Americans deserve better than Trump crony William Barr, use the button below to submit your signature and demand his resignation:

6,"Trump Pence Keep America Great |
Friend,
Obamagate is the biggest political crime in our Nation’s history.
Barack Obama will forever be remembered as the disgraced former President who used federal law enforcement in an attempt to hurt his political opponents.
His administration, including Sleepy Joe Biden, “illegally spied” on President Trump and his 2016 campaign and then LIED about it - we can’t let them get away with it.
The President trusts what you think, which is why he’s asked us personally to reach out to you and get your thoughts on how he should proceed with handling the greatest HOAX of all time.
We’re sending the first 75 responses to our quick 1-question poll directly to the President’s phone for him to review.
Do you think the Justice Department should investigate Barack Obama and his administration?
YES
NO
President Trump is really counting on your input.
The American People need to know if the Obama Administration illegally spied on President Trump and his campaign, and there’s only one way to find out. WE DESERVE THE TRUTH.
Do you think the Justice Department should investigate Barack Obama and his administration?
YES NO
Thank you,

Carolyn Maloney for Congress
Alex,
Pride Month this year came with a landmark victory when the Supreme Court ruled to bar employer discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals a few weeks ago. But in this month of celebration and appreciation for the LGBTQ+ community, we've also seen that there is still so much work to be done in the fight for equality.
The FDA continues to hold discriminatory blanket deferrals on blood donations. Anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes have persisted, particularly on transwomen of color. And on the 4 year anniversary of the Orlando Pulse Nightclub shooting, the president moved to allow healthcare providers to deny treatment to transgender patients.
Pride Month may be over, but the fight for LGBTQ+ equality is not.
I will continue to fight for protections for the LGBTQ+ community — not only in the workplace and healthcare but in all parts of American society until we have guaranteed that basic civil rights are not determined by sexual orientation or gender identity.
Today, I'm asking for your support in urging the Senate to pass The Equality Act — so that LGBTQ+ protections are universal and these individuals are guaranteed the human rights, dignity, and respect they deserve. ADD YOUR NAME NOW TO BECOME A CITIZEN CO-SPONSOR >>
Pride Equality Act Button
The Equality Act would expand nondiscrimination protections to healthcare, housing, credit, education, public spaces and services, and more. It is critical that we wholeheartedly support this effort to ensure the equality for the LGBTQ+ community that we’ve fought so long for.
The LGBTQ+ community will remain vulnerable to discrimination until we take legislative action to counter attacks from Trump and far-right challengers.
Add your name today to stand in solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community in the fight for equality. Sign now to become a citizen co-sponsor of The Equality Act >>
