Donald Trump is one of the most destructive presidents in history.
Even if we defeat him and he loses the presidency this November, he needs to be brought to justice for his corruption and crimes.
Democrats successfully impeached him, but his cronies in the Senate protected him from being removed!
So we need to know what Democrats in Florida think before we get started on crafting this strategy. Please respond ASAP to ensure your voice is heard >>

Patriot,
With all their guns aimed at Tucker Carlson, you’d think the radical Left would have their hands full.
But no…
They’ve now turned their guns ALSO on Sean Hannity in hopes they can kill two birds with one socialist stone.
Ever since Donald Trump won on election night in 2016, Barack Obama’s political network has been in socialist revolution mode.
And Hannity has called them out on it!
That’s why they hate him so much…he’s exposing their lies, corruption and Deep State collusion against President Trump.
We're rallying the Tea Party troops to launch our counter-revolution against the radical Left to circle the wagons for Hannity...
…because they just ESCALATED their plan to take him out, too.
##  SIGN THE PETITION:
DEFEND HANNITY!
Just this week Hannity called out the radical leftist Democrats for their failed leadership:
> ""We have Pelosi. We have Schumer. We have Biden. 125 years of swamp failure. They have done nothing to quell inner-city violent crime anywhere in America, nothing to fix the broken dilapidated disgusting and repulsive educational system. They have failed America's children. We have far left mayors. They have ruled these cities for decades. They have completely failed their citizens.""
They HATE Hannity for exposing the truth!
So in order to shut him up, they’ve launched a scandalous — completely bogus — ""attack campaign"" against both Hannity and Tucker...
…they recruited a disgruntled former employee to make scurrilous claims of harassment at Fox News…which “have no basis in fact whatsoever.""
But the truth has never gotten in the way of the radical Left’s plan to entirely destroy conservative patriots and remove them from the airways!
The problem is, if we don’t step up and defend Hannity alongside our defense of Tucker, it’s only a matter of time before they prevail!
If you think this is just fear-mongering, think again. This is EXACTLY how they took down Bill O’Reilly!
With O’Reilly’s head on a proverbial pike, they’re foaming at the mouth to lop off Hannity’s head, too.
If we lose Hannity’s critical voice, cutting through lies and deception from the Left, President Trump’s ability to counteract the fake news media will be severely muted ahead of November.
That's why I need you to sign Hannity's petition right now and join the counter-revolution to keep him on the air. Will you sign?
Steve Eichler,
CEO, [[URL REDACTED]]

28,"Joe Biden made his unsurprising announcement that Kamala Harris will be his Vice Presidential running mate.
Laura Loomer for Congress
Patriot,
Joe Biden made his unsurprising announcement that Kamala Harris will be his Vice Presidential running mate.
I’ve dealt with Kamala Harris and exposed her blatant political corruption back in 2017 as an investigative journalist.
Of course, the Mainstream Media didn’t run with the story at the time so let me tell you a bit about what I uncovered.
In October of 2016, Trump supporter and activist, Mark Feigin was arrested and charged by then California Attorney General Kamala Harris for making “criminal threats” and “annoying phone calls” to an Islamic Center.
It turns out, Feigin didn’t make the calls, but I found out who did, and I published the police interviews that took place with the real culprit.
Despite Mr. Feigin being TOTALLY cleared of the false accusations, Kamala wouldn’t stop and demanded he sign a plea agreement that required 5 years of formal probation, and community service that would be SUPERVISED BY A MUSLIM GROUP.
Kamala Harris also demanded that Mark Feigin denounce the “Alt-Right” even though he was never associated with it.
That’s right, Kamala Harris demanded a U.S. Citizen denounce beliefs after falsely charging him with a hate crime.
Kamala is the poster child of political corruption and with her elevation to the #2 most powerful Democrat in the nation, you can rest assured that AOC, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and every other power-hungry Democrat in Congress will emulate Kamala’s model to use the government against political adversaries.
And I plan on being in Congress in 2021 to stop them. Help me get there today.
We’re days away from Primary Day in Florida and my eyes are set on the General Election and meeting our fundraising goals to win in November.
We have $36,725 left to raise before Primary Day. Will you chip in $10 today and ask a friend to do the same?
Our General Election media blitz needs to be funded with a war chest to compete against my Democrat opponent and any amount you can donate will help us get there. Chip in $10, $20 or whatever you can afford.
Kamala Harris will be the new corrupt “attack dog” of the Left as Joe Biden can’t even string along a sentence and she’ll spawn a dozen wannabe’s in Congress who will be hell-bent on destroying or silencing any conservative who challenges them.
But they’ve tried that with me . . . for years.
They failed, I’m still here and they know that when they send their attack dogs after me, they’re the ones who get bitten.
Send me to Washington by donating today.
Thank you again for all that you do.
Respectfully,
Laura Loomer

####  Virginia apartment manager ends screening policy barring renters with minor convictions
By JEFF SOUTH, Virginia Mercury
A company that manages about 1,700 of apartments in Northern Virginia has agreed to stop automatically rejecting any applicant with a criminal conviction no matter how old or minor — a policy that fair-housing advocates said discriminated against Black and Latino renters. As a result of a lawsuit filed by Housing Opportunities Made Equal of Virginia, Kay Management Co. agreed to screen applicants primarily for felony convictions within the past five years. Under the new policy, the company can look 10 or more years into an applicant’s past only for homicides or serious sex- or drug-related crimes.

####  How COVID-19 Spread, and Was Contained, at Two Nursing Homes
By MEGAN PAULY AND MALLORY NOE-PAYNE, WCVE
Before the COVID-19 outbreak was over, almost every resident of a small nursing home in the Shenandoah Valley would contract the virus. The facility’s administrator would get it, so many staff would quit it would become a struggle to keep the facility functioning, and 22 people -- about a fifth of the residents -- would die. Meanwhile, at a nursing home just hours away in Richmond, COVID-19 patients would be kept to a single floor with dedicated staff, isolated from the rest of the population. Only 13 residents and four staff members would get the virus, and none would die.

####  In former Confederate capital, a push to honor the enslaved
By SARAH RANKIN, Associated Press
For more than 150 years, Virginia’s capital city greeted visitors with a landscape steeped in Confederate heritage and dotted with its relics, including a collection of enormous statues to rebel fighters. Tucked away, or in many cases buried, was evidence of Richmond’s pivotal role in the lucrative domestic slave trade. Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children were jailed, bought and sold in the city, and shipped across the South in the decades preceding the Civil War.

####  Family of George Floyd visits Richmond to see unveiling of high-tech memorial
Washington Post (Metered Paywall - 3 articles a month)
The creators of a high-tech memorial to George Floyd wanted to unveil it in a place that had deep meaning for the cause of fighting racial inequity, so they chose the grandest totem in the former capital of the Confederacy: the statue of Robert E. Lee on this city's Monument Avenue. Floyd’s family traveled to Richmond to be present for Tuesday’s unveiling of a holographic portrait of the man whose death in May at the hands of Minneapolis police touched off protests around the world.

####  Chincoteague Island holds virtual pony auction as it adapts to historic pandemic
By JASON FRALEY, WTOP
Vacationing on Chincoteague Island, Virginia, has become an annual tradition for folks in the DMV. However, this week marks the first cancellation of its pony activities since World War II. “This would have been the 95th year,” Denise Bowden of the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company told WTOP. “The last time that the pony swim and the carnival and everything got canceled was back in 1942 and 1943 during World War II. … I have no other way to put it except that it feels just as weird as everything else has this year.”

The worst-kept secret in town was the dominant topic of town council’s July 21 meeting. That, and new Mayor Stacey Carson’s working relationship with a few members of council. Those two matters were intertwined from the meeting’s commencement, as Carson questioned the purpose for a planned closed-door discussion. What was not discussed until near the meeting’s end — and only then was referenced indirectly with no names mentioned — was the town-wide rumor regarding the recent departure of an employee who has been accused of crimes.

####  Morel: Why Lee should remain a namesake of my university
By LUCAS E. MOREL, published in Richmond Times-Dispatch (Access to this article limited to subscribers)
Robert E. Lee committed treason when he became general of the Army of Northern Virginia in support of Southern secession. Its goal was a separate nation devoted to white supremacy and black slavery. But with the Union victory, Lee submitted to federal authority and set an example of reconciliation for a defeated South. Lee’s post-war leadership of Washington College led the faculty to ask that his name be added to the school’s masthead.
Morel is the John K. Boardman, Jr. Professor of Politics at Washington and Lee University and author of “Lincoln and the American Founding,” recently published by Southern Illinois University Press.

30,"Dear Alex,
I am Sandy Smith, the Republican nominee for Congress in North Carolina’s newly redrawn 1st Congressional district.
I am a patriot who has had it with unconstitutional lockdown orders, given by liberal Trump-hating socialist Democrats who are trying to tank the economy to hurt the President politically.
Mean-spirited left-wing partisan hack governors have been punishing ordinary citizens all across the country, for the ""crime"" of trying to feed their families and avoid losing their businesses.
Image
In Michigan, their Democrat Governor is persecuting small businesses like a 77-year old barber:
State regulators on Wednesday suspended the license of a 77-year-old Michigan barber who insisted on cutting hair despite an order to stay closed during the coronavirus pandemic.
Karl Manke has pledged to keep his shop open “until Jesus comes.” A judge declined the state’s request to shut down his shop Monday without first holding a hearing. Regulators took a different path by suspending his barber license and his shop license.
In Oregon, their governor sent Child Protective Services to harass a small business owner who tried to open in defiance of their Democrat governor's order:
Oregon Occupational Safety and Health issued a $14,000 fine to Lindsey Graham, owner of Glamor Salon in Salem, for reopening her salon May 5 in defiance of Gov. Kate Brown's stay-home order.
""I'm being threatened and intimidated and bullied daily by the government,"" Graham said during a press conference Friday. ""I'm sad that I can drive 20 minutes down the freeway, and that person's job as a hairstylist is essential, according to Kate Brown. But my job, 20 minutes up the street, is nonessential.""
""I don't want anyone to get sick. I know you guys don't want anyone to get sick,"" Graham said. ""But I also don't want to go bankrupt and lose everything I worked for and neither do you.""
She also claimed that Child Protective Services had visited her house and questioned her child. ""I've never expected such a violent, aggressive, vindictive thing could ever be done to me or my family,"" she said, ""because I'm trying to earn a living, because I'm trying to work.""
Here in North Carolina, we have another one of these abusive governors, Roy Cooper.
This guy is every bit the tinpot dictator that the governors of Michigan and Oregon are. You may recall that the Republican National Convention (which I will attend as a Trump delegate!) is in Charlotte, NC in August:
President Donald Trump this week accused North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper of “playing politics” with reopening the state, and said it would be “bad for them” if the state were to delay the start of the Republican National Convention in Charlotte.
“No, no,” Trump replied. “We’ll have a convention. I’m a traditionalist, but we’ll have to see, like everything else, but I think we’ll be in good shape by that time. We have a great state, North Carolina, that’s been very, very good.
“Although, it’s got a Democrat governor, so we have to be a little bit careful. It’s got a Democrat governor, so we have to be a little bit careful with that, because they’re playing politics. They’re playing politics, as you know, by delaying the openings. ... To me that’s politics. They think it’s a bad thing for me if they delay the opening. I think it’s bad for them. And you have people protesting outside, and those people like Trump.”
Image
Our hyper-partisan governor would cancel the RNC if he thought he could get away with it. That's how these tyrannical Democrat governors roll. I have never met anyone so lost in what he is doing. A lost socialist is very very dangerous because you combine incompetence with bad left wing policy at the same time.
I've had it with these people. It is now abundantly clear that their motives were NEVER to keep anyone safe or healthy. It's to accumulate power for themselves, punish those who work for a living to support their families, and tank the economy for the election.
I am disgusted and shocked by their actions. No red-blooded American should ever stand for tyranny, and no one should stand for political-fueled retributions, either.
If you are proud of our president, as I am, I need YOUR help urgently to defeat my high-level radical socialist Democrat opponent and retake this swing seat!
Let's send a message to the Socialist NC governor. Let's show these tyrants that they can't get away with this.
I am proud of those who are standing to fight with me. I have already been endorsed by Congressman Mark Walker, Congressman Ted Budd, and Congressman Mark Meadows. Here is a picture of me and Mark Meadows. Congressman Meadows used to be Chairman of the Freedom Caucus, and now he is the President Trump’s Chief of Staff in the White House. He “proudly endorsed” me shortly before his promotion, which I was so honored!
Image
President Trump has accomplished so much with constant pushback from the socialists, like these governors. Imagine what he can do with a supportive Congress!
It is so crucial that we take advantage of every chance we have to flip a swing district \- which North Carolina’s First District now is! They just redrew the map and took away a bunch of Democrat voters, making this district MUCH more competitive.
But this year, this district turned into a swing district. Half of the district has never been represented by Butterfield. They don’t know him, and they are Republicans!
Will you help me beat Butterfield and deprive Nancy Pelosi of a reliable vote? I need you to send $15, $35, or $250 right now so that I can meet my goal by the end of this month. This deadline is so critical, and I have no time to lose.
I will NEVER vote with Nancy Pelosi! She and her insane leftist agenda can pound sand!
Can you help me take this swing district back, with your best and immediate contribution of $15, $35, or $250? Taking out one of Pelosi’s leading lieutenants would be a major, crippling blow to the socialist anti-American left and to Nancy Pelosi’s agenda. Please rush back your supporting contribution today. Thank you.
G.K. Butterfield is a leftist extremist, not a patriot, but to replace him I really need your help. I appreciate you and thank you.
For God and Country,

32,"their real plan
catholicvote
email logo
Dear Alex,
If all goes according to plan...
House Democrats will vote to impeach President Trump later tonight.
But the fact is, that’s been the plan for the past three years.
CONSIDER THIS: Since President Trump took the oath of office, House Democrats have introduced legislation to impeach President Trump for colluding with Russia, for denigrating central American countries, for conflicts of [[URL REDACTED]] for criticizing NFL players who kneel during the national anthem!
Earlier this year, Committee Chairman and Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler was overheard on an Amtrak train talking about impeachment schemes. And this was 6 months before any claim of a quid pro quo with Ukraine ever surfaced. It was only a matter of time.
So what should Catholics think?
Impeachment is serious business. It involves accusing the President of a “high crime” and then acting to overturn the result of an election -- because allowing him to continue in office poses too grave a threat. For this reason, impeachment requires making a convincing public case, and backing it up with facts.
On this score, Democrats have failed miserably.
Whether you are pro-Trump, anti-Trump, never-Trump, or just tired of the hyper-partisan gamesmanship altogether, ripping apart the country with a dubious impeachment effort 11 months from an election is both unwarranted and dangerous. It will divide the country further, inflame already-heightened political tensions, and undermine the common good.
We need not detail the many ways this impeachment process has been hamfisted and tainted from the start. From its spurious origins, to its lack of transparency, its hyper-rushed and unfair process, and finally its failure to provide proof of a single crime, the whole thing leads to an obvious conclusion: this impeachment effort represents an abuse of power, carried out for political theater because of Democrats’ deep hatred of President Trump and his policies.
Is President Trump guiltless?
The President is not your typical politician. His style is confrontational and abrasive. And depending on how you interpret his call with Ukraine (which everyone can read), you could certainly claim he mismanaged his desire to clean up widespread corruption in Ukraine with the distribution of foreign aid.
But a high crime and misdemeanor? An “existential threat to the Republic?”
As Joe Biden might say: “C’mon man!”
And don’t forget the center of this controversy. Hunter Biden. A shameless corporate grifter who leveraged his father’s power as Vice President to enrich himself. Is he immune from oversight? Imagine if the tables were turned and Donald Trump Jr. were being paid millions by shady foreign corporations. We know what would happen.
The concept of impeaching a president was once considered a grave matter. Before today, it’s only happened twice in American history (Nixon would have been impeached but he resigned before it happened).
The use of the filibuster was once rare, too. Yet because of Democratic hyper-partisanship, it’s now commonplace in the Senate. And now the danger of making the power of impeachment a regular political tool has been unleashed. You can be sure, if a Democrat is elected President in the future while Republicans control Congress, he or she will face an impeachment vote.
Thankfully, this political charade will end soon.
Reports suggest Senator McConnell may move immediately to fast-track an all-but-certain vote to acquit the President and move on. We certainly hope so.
Furthermore, in the coming months the country will be offered a Democratic alternative to President Trump.
And the American people will be offered a clear choice -- on the issues that matter.
The truth is, in the end, that’s what today’s vote is all about:
November 2020.

34,"It would appear that $60 Million in bribes & dark money isn't enough for Paul to abandon his dear friend Larry Householder.
Friend,
Yesterday, while 91 members of the Ohio House voted to remove the indicted Larry Householder as Speaker, Paul Zeltwanger refused.
When faced with the chance to remove Householder as a member of the House for his crimes against the state and good people of Ohio, Paul Zeltwanger refused again.
Whether it's spreading debunked conspiracy theories about COVID-19 or turning a blind eye to the corruption of his dear friend Householder, Paul Zeltwanger has made it clear that the people of the 54th district will never be his main priority.
Let's send him home.
To that end, can you help us meet our end of the month fundraising goal by chipping in $25 today? Sending Morgan Showen to the Statehouse will bring us one step closer to restoring trust and integrity to the House.
Thanks for all that you do to make our campaign possible.

We’re committed to electing more Democratic women to Congress in 2020 and beyond. President Trump, the Republicans and the Supreme Court are rapidly chipping away women’s rights, so the stakes and the urgency could not be higher.

36,"homicides are up by double-digits in major cities across America this year – and it’s a wake-up call that our country can’t afford the Left’s agenda
Claudia for Congress
Friend,
This year has devastated so many communities across America, and the situation is only being made worse by Democrats who are terrified of facing the facts about their failed leadership.
We need to address what’s going on in our major cities right now.
* Homicides have risen by double-digits in 36 out of America’s 50 largest cities so far this year.
* Recent polls show that 77% of Americans are concerned about rising crime in our cities.
Democrats know why this is happening, but they’ll never admit that they’re the reason!
The Left’s radical crusade against law enforcement is taking a devastating toll on lives and communities across our country, and it will only get worse if we don’t stand up to their anti-police agenda before it’s too late.
CHIP IN TO RESTORE LAW & ORDER THIS NOVEMBER
Our men and women in blue are watching our communities fall apart right now, and they’re calling for backup from Washington – but Democrats like Anthony Brindisi refuse to answer the call!
That’s because Brindisi is more loyal to Pelosi than he is to our police departments, our district, and even the voters who supported him in 2018!
That’s why the New York State Troopers PBA just endorsed our campaign. They’re sick and tired of being abandoned by Congress, and they’re counting on us to change that.

MY CANDIDATE STATEMENT
Ronald Reagan proclaimed our country as a Beacon of Light and a Shining City on a Hill, but right now we are not reaching our potential as a country.
We need leaders with solutions. We need leaders that can relate to the struggles of everyday people. Most importantly, we need leaders that value honesty and new ideas.
I understand your struggles and I am bringing new ideas, the needed experience and a fresh perspective to the table that will help restore the American dream.
As a business owner and concerned citizen, I worry for the future of Californian families. We have high taxes, increased crime, inadequate enforcement of immigration laws and growing poverty rates.
In Orange County, rents are skyrocketing, homelessness is on the rise, and regardless of party, leaders are not acting in good faith to the great people they represent.
The last thing we need right now are more career politicians. It is time for change and I will never stop fighting on behalf of you!
I am running on a Pro-Constitution, American Family Values and Common-Sense Conservative platform. Once I am your Congressman, we will Make Orange County Great Again!
My campaign is For Our Country and For Our Future. I graciously ask for your vote in this upcoming election. I encourage you to go to my website, [[URL REDACTED]], to read my story and my platform.

Dear Patriot
It's Aliscia Andrews here, and as you know, I'm a U. S. Marine, National security expert who has worked keeping our nation safe at the border, and a mom who has seen the Left destroy this country one piece at a time.
This is a district that has been Republican for 60 out of the last 66 years and can be flipped with your support!
I’m done letting it happen. I’m fighting back with everything I have.
I’ve spent a career keeping this nation safe. Now, the Left is trying to undo all of our security by abolishing the police, abolishing law and order, and keeping our economy shackled in lockdown.
Can I count on you to join our stand against Socialism? Donate $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, or any other amount today and you can help us stop the Socialist Left from taking over!
DONATE TODAY!
There are only 28 Days left!
We have a choice—we can either choose President Trump, the side that’s beating the coronavirus or the Socialist Radical Left that wants to topple all public safety in the middle of a crime wave and a pandemic.
I’m standing with our President!
He beat the coronavirus and just left the hospital! But, not before thanking the tens of thousands of Trump supporters for coming to pray for him!
The Left lost their minds when he did this. They beat their keyboards screaming about how he isn’t really sick, endangered people, and other nonsense accusations!
If President Obama had done the exact same thing after getting sick, they would be fawning over him for his bravery.
The Fake News media is blinded by fanatical leftist hatred against our President. No President has been more mistreated by the Fake News media!
Let’s send them a strong message— let’s retire Socialist Wexton who wrongly tweeted that our President is a white supremacist!
That’s just sick!
Please donate your most generous gift today and we can stop the Socialist Left here and now! We only have 28 days and we need to keep up with Bloomberg’s spending here in the 10th!
God Bless,

Hi Alex,
I am Wendy Rogers, the Republican nominee for Arizona Senate. I won my primary in a rout because I am tough on illegal immigration! I am President Trump's biggest supporter on this issue... and he has stood up for us in ways no President ever has!
The President made it clear from the start: He was standing up for the American people, and he didn't care who opposed him. And I'm so glad he did!
Just this week he proposed lowering refugee admissions to the lowest level in history!
He is helping Arizona more than anyone else has:
After years of leading the world in refugee admissions, the number of refugees admitted to the U.S. has plummeted under the Trump administration.
The Trump administration proposed Wednesday that the U.S. would admit no more than 15,000 refugees in fiscal year 2021, which began Oct. 1. That is the lowest number since the refugee program began in 1980, and 3,000 fewer than the 18,000 ceiling the Trump administration set in 2020, the previous historic low.
Arizona has long been one of the main states for accepting refugees from around the world.
""The President’s proposal for refugee resettlement in Fiscal Year 2021 reflects the Administration’s continuing commitment to prioritize the safety and well-being of Americans, especially in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,"" the statement said.
Image
His policies getting tough on immigration have directly helped Arizona. We were being overrun by illegal immigrants, drug cartels, crime, gangs, and murders- before the President took action.
Now we have stabilized our situation which allows us to deal with other problems, like COVID. He has really helped Arizona! That's why, in the Arizona Senate, I intend to push for restrictions on illegal immigration to support the President's policies and protect Arizonans from crime and drugs.
Cops are being shot. Innocent peoples' businesses and homes burnt. And they want to not be held accountable for it, by getting rid of our brave police.
Will you help me support the President's policies?
George Soros and the extreme Left are supporting my Democrat opponent. I can beat her- but I need your help!
If we are to stop Soros and Antifa, it has to be done at the polls. And that's why I need your help urgently!
Time is slipping by. Just a month to go- and the Left thinks they can take my seat. I need your help to stop them from stealing this thing!
I was one of the first 100 women to fly in the Air Force. I will not be bullied by the far Left- not now, not ever!
Voting by mail is happening here right now. I have no time to waste. I need your help urgently to get our message out!
The Far-Left and their media allies have done hit pieces on me to try to blunt my momentum. That's why I need your help to fend off these attacks!
Please, rush back your maximum donation of $15, $35, $60, $100, $250 or whatever you can afford right now help me fend off Soros and the Swamp and win this seat!

44,"Friend,
Kelly stood strong for law-and-order this week - taking several major actions to support our police officers, crack down on criminals, and bring peace back to our streets.
In major news, Kelly was the first candidate in her race to call for convicted cop killers to be sentenced to death for their crimes. Her strong stand comes just days after two sheriff's deputies – who are still recovering in the hospital – were brutally ambushed by a masked gunman in Los Angeles. As Kelly said:
""For months, the radical left’s defund the police movement has promoted violence, chaos and anarchy in cities across our country, while villainizing and attacking the brave men and women in law enforcement who risk their lives to keep us safe. Now these dangerous leftists have started putting words into violent action — targeting and brutally attacking law enforcement. That’s why today I am calling for convicted cop killers in America to be sentenced to death.""
In fact, Kelly even blasted Kamala Harris this week for her failure to denounce the ""disgusting"" display of hatred toward the injured deputies by protesters outside the hospital. She slammed Kamala for promoting a bail fund to free violent criminals - including those who are targeting our police officers on the streets. And later in the week, Kelly took action - joining her colleagues to introduce the ""Serve and Protect Act,"" which would slap offenders like the Compton gunman with a 10 years-to-life sentence for targeting law enforcement officers for assault or murder.
In addition to being recognized for her law-and-order values this week, Kelly also won praise for her pro-life positions - receiving an ""A"" rating from the Susan B. Anthony List, which has already strongly endorsed her campaign. Kelly is 100% pro-life - and will always fight against the abortion-on-demand agenda of the Left.
On top of that, Kelly took a few more principled stands this week - slamming Disney for its cozy relationship with China, and pushing back hard against Netflix's new Cuties movie for its exploitation of young children. She has led on this issue, calling for a hearing on preventing human and child trafficking.
Finally, Kelly joined President Trump at the White House for the signing of the Abraham Accords, which marked the historic normalization of relations in the Middle East. As Kelly said on the Guy Benson show this week:
""This is the fulfillment of promises made and kept by President Trump from day one. Truly historic to see the leaders from UAE and Bahrain on the stage with Netanyahu and President Trump. Truly historic and important. I mean, this is a fulfillment of the president's promise of ongoing building peace through strength ... He's delivered at every step along the way, whether it's dealing with North Korea or Iran and now bringing peace to the Middle East in this very historic and certainly Nobel-peace worthy agreement.""
Speaking of promises kept, Kelly announced this week that Accura Engineering, a Georgia-owned business, has been awarded a government contract to play a key role in constructing the border wall. Kelly is a strong proponent of President Trump's wall, and she is thrilled to see a Georgia business contribute so much to this effort.
While Kelly fights for conservative Georgia values, the same can't be said for her opponents. Doug Collins is a weak-on-crime career politician who has teamed up with radical liberal Stacey Abrams to undercut the 2nd Amendment, raise taxes on hardworking Georgians, and reduce prison time for violent criminals. Instead of fighting for Georgians, Doug spent years embracing Abrams and building close friendships with unhinged liberals like impeachment manager Hakeem Jeffries, who called Donald Trump the ""grand wizard of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.""

Jacob Blake is innocent. But that didn’t stop Kenosha police officers from shooting him 7 times in the back for no reason.
But the officers who shot Blake, leaving him paralyzed for life, still haven’t been charged with any crime -- it’s unbelievable.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are DEMANDING the officer who shot Blake be charged and held accountable for his crime, and they need EVERY good Democrat standing with them to call for IMMEDIATE justice.
Biden and Harris need 100,000 activists to sign on TODAY. Justice cannot wait. Sign your name now →
I DEMAND JUSTICE. ADD MY NAME ➞
Justice must be served.
Jacob Blake was shot in front of his three small children. He spent the following days in the hospital fighting for his life. He’s paralyzed.
“Dismantling systemic racism starts with demanding justice and holding offenders accountable. Based on what I've seen, it seems the officer should be charged.”
Kamala Harris
Jacob Blake is innocent. But his innocence couldn’t protect him from the horrors of police brutality. Just like it couldn’t protect George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and countless more.
What makes this all even worse is that Kenosha cops were seen cozying up to white supremacists in the ensuing protests. Their racism runs deep.
So we’re standing with Biden and Harris to DEMAND the officer who shot Blake be charged.
Biden and Harris need every Good Democrat standing with them to DEMAND justice for Jacob Blake. Sign on to demand the officer who shot Blake be charged →

Black Americans deserve the right to get into their own car, free from harm.

47,"Meuser for Congress
Alex --
Good evening and welcome to our Week-End Update.
This week, much of the news in Washington revolved around the impeachment hearings in the U.S. Senate. Over the past months and weeks, I have detailed my feelings regarding the impeachment sham.
I believe that the Wall Street Journal’s Kimberly Strassel encapsulates many of the points I have been stressing and makes a compelling case, in her piece Crying Wolf on Impeachment against the Democratic leadership. She writes:
“The impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump is coming down to one big question: Will Democrats, by crying wolf, drown out the more legitimate Republican cry of foul? ‘Foul’ has served as the GOP’s most powerful and honest argument from the first days of these impeachment maneuverings.”
“Democrats broke every standard of due process, transparency and fairness in their House investigation, making a mockery of their constitutional duty.”
* “They hid the identity of the original accuser, denying Republicans and the country the ability to judge his motives.”
* “They held secret depositions, barring more than three-quarters of House members, as well as the press and the American public.”
* “They called 18 witnesses, but blocked the president from calling any in his defense.”
* “The White House legal team was excluded from the proceedings—prohibited from cross-examining witnesses, denied the ability to introduce any evidence that spoke to the central question of the president’s focus on Ukrainian corruption.”
* “Democrats approved two articles of impeachment that failed to identify a crime.”
The U.S. Senate rejected the call for more witnesses in the impeachment trial. House Democratic Leadership has failed to make a case for impeachment and there is no reason to call additional witnesses. It was interesting to see that the Democrats were hellbent on calling additional witnesses as long as they are not Joe or Hunter Biden. Maybe because they are like an onion, the more you peel the Bidens back, the more you cry. Thankfully for our nation, it appears this saga will be concluding in the coming days... or as the New York Post headline reads below, it's ""All Over But The Pouting.""
The President made strides in our efforts towards peace between Israel and Palestine. Peace requires compromise, but Israel cannot compromise the security of their country or its people. President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu created an agreement that balances peaceful coexistence with the need for security.
Additionally, President Trump signed the USMCA trade agreement.
This historic trade deal is another example of President Trump’s policies putting our workers, farmers, and manufacturers first.
* USMCA adds $68 billion to our economy and will create 176,000 jobs nationwide. The President signing USMCA delivers a key promise to level the playing field for our country in trade.
* Mexico and Canada are key markets for goods and agricultural products from Pennsylvania. This deal supports farmers and businesses in our district by improving their market access and is an especially great improvement for our dairy producers.
* USMCA ushers in a more balanced and fairer trading relationship for North America and is a big win for America and Pennsylvania.
I spoke on the floor of the United States House this week about the different definitions of productivity at the two ends of Pennsylvania Avenue at this point in time. At the Capitol, Democrat Leadership continues to confuse activity with accomplishment. They have spent YEARS trying to impeach and remove a duly elected president. However, at the White House, President Trump has delivered two significant victories this week... a middle east peace plan and the signing of the USMCA. Just imagine of all the energy from this impeachment was used to solve the problems of the American people. It is critical Republicans #TakeBackTheHouse
IN NEWS YOU WON’T HEAR IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA: This week, I voted against the House Democrat Leadership's attempt to further weaken our countries ability to respond to terrorists in a combat zone by stripping the President as Commander and Chief's authority to engage our military to target and eliminate terrorists or enemies of the state. This authority was effectively put to use to takeout terrorist Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Soleimani was designated a terrorist by multiple countries. This legislation is being brought to the House floor for a vote only to damage the President politically and with a blind eye to our countries safety.
The 2002 Authorization for Use MF authorizes military action to “defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq,” including against ISIS and threats directed by Iran.
Repealing the Authorization for Use of Military Force without a replacement would undermine the Iraqi government, send the wrong signal to our regional partners and allies, and embolden Iran-backed militia groups who fuel sectarian violence.
On Tuesday, we paused to observe Holocaust Remembrance Day and recognize the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We remember the survivors, those who were lost and pledge to fight anti-Semitism. #NeverAgain
We also recognized School Choice Week. Families should have the ability to choose a school that best fits their needs, child’s skills and interests. This is an opportunity to advocate for choice and celebrate public, private, parochial and all schools educating our youth for the jobs of today and tomorrow.
Today is also the beginning of Black History Month and we celebrate the lasting legacies of African Americans whose lives have shaped our nation’s history and culture. Today, black Americans have someone in the White House in President Trump who is delivering record low unemployment.
One of the most significant accomplishments of the Trump Administration has been the President’s success in making our nation energy independent. No longer are we held hostage to the Middle East as we work to ensure our nation can produce its own power to keep us all moving. As part of that effort, President Trump is working to save over 1,000 family-sustaining jobs in Pennsylvania by helping to keep the refinery in Philadelphia open. Click here to read more.
I joined other members of Congress as we received a briefing from Dr. Redfield from the Center for Disease Control, Dr. Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Kadlec from the Department of Health and Human Services, and Jonathan Fritz and Yolanda Parra from the State Department regarding the coronavirus. Their briefing provided the following information:
* At this time, the virus poses a low risk to the United States and there are only 5 confirmed cases here.
* There are 6,000 confirmed cases in China concentrated mostly in Wuhan Province. Chinese officials have severely restricted travel from Wuhan Province to contain the virus there.
* Treatments are being developed but may take a year to be fully developed. As health officials contain this virus, the U.S. CDC recommends against all nonessential travel to China.
* The CDC feels the best way to contain coronavirus is through classic public health measures such as maintaining a high level of hygiene, regularly washing your hands, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and face.
Chinese and American officials are in regular contact and we will receive updates as will the general public. I will provide future updates as I receive them. For additional information about coronavirus and how to prevent its spread, visit the CDC website.
In the District, I want to send out my congratulations and support to Lebanon County’s former District Attorney and our new State Senator Dave Arnold. Dave was sworn-in on Wednesday and will be a tremendous addition Harrisburg. Dave is a conservative and understands that smaller government and lower taxes leads to prosperity. As many of you know. Dave was diagnosed with brain cancer shortly after receiving the GOP nomination for State Senate. Dave is beating cancer and his doctors have given him an excellent prognosis. This situation highlights the strength of Dave’s family as his wife and daughter stood by his side as he battled cancer and won his election to the state senate. I look forward to working alongside Dave as we focus on making Lebanon County an even better place to live, work and raise our families.
Additionally, I want to acknowledge our new Lebanon County District Attorney Pier Hess Graf. She will be a strong voice against crime and be tenacious in her work to keep our streets safe.
As a reminder, as this is an election year, we have begun circulating petitions to run for reelection to Congress. Petition circulation begins this Tuesday, January 28th. If you would like to join our team, please let us know. For copies of petitions, questions or information regarding petition events across the District, please contact our Field Campaign Manager Rob Bresnahan at [[URL REDACTED]]
Today, we attended the Berks County GOP meeting, where I officially announced my intentions to seek another term in office. Representing the people of the 9th District is a tremendous honor and responsibility. My goal every day is to do what’s in the best interests of the families, neighborhoods and communities in our District. Berks County has always been so welcoming to our campaign and we felt it was appropriate to make our formal reelection announcement surrounding by our friends and supporters in the County. Pictured below with GOP Auditor General candidate Tim DeFoor and a younger supporter Suzannah Gillen who I gave my lapel pin.
Later, we attended the Columbia County GOP Winter Picnic. We were joined by State Senator John Gordner and State Representatives David Millard and Kurt Masser. This was a great event and there is a lot of enthusiasm for President Trump and the Republican ticket. Pictured below with Ashok & Naymesh Patel and children.
Last week, we inserted a political cartoon we thought was timely regarding the impeachment effort. This week, I have another cartoon I found that I think is appropriate considering tomorrow is Groundhog Day. Enjoy.
On Monday, I will appear on WPPA “Step up to the Mic” from 10-11 am. If you get a chance, please be sure to tune in.
Thank you and we will see you soon,

Wow, what a month!
June was Pride Month — and Ralph Norman fought to allow employers to discriminate against LGBTQ+ Americans just for being who they are.
We’ve been reckoning with the epidemic of racism against Black Americans — and Ralph Norman initially voted against making lynching a federal hate crime.
We’ve been dealing with a spike in COVID-19 infections here in South Carolina — and Ralph Norman voted against COVID-19 relief for South Carolina families.
REPLACE RALPH »
I’ll be honest, team — I can’t find a reason not to show Ralph Norman the door.
But it’s not going to be easy, because all that energy Ralph hasn’t spent fighting for South Carolinians like you and me, he’s spent building his business in Congress and running hundreds of thousands of dollars of Facebook ads to hold on to his seat.

#  Voting While Black
Hey Friend,
#ByeAnita. In this little hashtag lies the origin story of Color Of Change PAC.
I’m Jenni, I lead the digital and communications teams for Color Of Change PAC. You don’t usually hear from me because most of my work is behind-the-scenes, but today I want to tell you our origin story, and how it's connected to re-electing Kim Foxx in 20 days.
(If you already know you support Kim Foxx, the most powerful action you can take is donating $3 to help our organizer Audrey in Chicago reach the thousands of people we need to win and continue transforming criminal justice. Otherwise, read on!)
Back in 2016, Color Of Change PAC barely existed. But over years of working on criminal justice campaigns, our team had started realizing that district attorneys, state’s attorneys, and other public prosecutors are some of the most powerful players in the justice system. They have the power to decide who gets charged with crimes and who doesn't, whether police are held accountable for harming and killing people, whether cash bail keeps poor people locked up, and so much more.
We heard about a candidate in Cook County, IL named Kim Foxx, who was challenging then-State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez. Alvarez had made national headlines for refusing for over a year to charge the police officer who shot 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times in Chicago. Kim Foxx was promising to hold officers accountable, to stop targeting Black and Latinx communities with low-level crimes, and to provide real safety and support for Cook County residents.
So I was hired (just as a short-term position back then!) to help elect Foxx, only a few weeks before the election. Back then, you seldom heard anything about prosecutor elections or the importance of showing up in them. So I sent digital ads all over Chicago informing tens of thousands of people about the upcoming election, making sure Black communities heard and recognized Kim Foxx’s name. And along with our partners on the ground, we got #ByeAnita trending all over social media.
Then that March, Election Day came around-- and Kim Foxx won! And in the last 4 years, she’s proven that fighting to elect her has been worth it. In just 4 years Kim Foxx has:
* Helped thousands of struggling people get into rehab and job programs, and provided services for students at risk of incarceration
* Cleared the names of over 1000 people with racist marijuana convictions from the War on Drugs
* Led the nation in exonerations, with 94 innocent people’s names cleared
Kim Foxx’s election was the first time that Color Of Change PAC got to actually elect a candidate who improved Black people’s lives. We were literally making our vision for our organization a reality.
Friend, my biggest fear is that if another “tough-on-crime” prosecutor is elected, all of the progress Kim Foxx has made will be destroyed. That’s why I have to ask: will you donate $3 to help us reach all the undecided voters we can in the next 20 days and convince them to vote for Kim Foxx?
I don’t want Black people in Cook County to fear being thrown in jail for struggling with addiction or mental illness or poverty.
I don’t want young people’s lives wasted behind bars for mistakes they made as children.
And I definitely don’t want to see any police officer not have to answer for killing an innocent person in the streets.
But I’ve spoken with Audrey, our organizer in Chicago, and there are still a lot of people who aren’t sure whether to vote for Kim Foxx.
We have 20 days to change their minds. Are you with us?
Yes, I want to donate to help people break the cycle of mass incarceration and live safe, thriving lives under Kim Foxx's leadership!

While many of them decried the “partisan” nature of impeachment, in the end, only the coverup was partisan. One Republican, Mitt Romney, joined every Democrat to remove Trump from office, while the rest of the Republicans voted to give Trump license to commit any crime he’d like to ensure his re-election.
We’re going to mobilize the 7 million newly eligible voters who have turned 18 since the 2016 election. And we’re going to ensure that turnout this November is #TooBigToRig. Stand with us today!

POLICY SPOTLIGHT:
FIGHTING FOR VOTING RIGHTS
I have worked hard as a legislator to protect the voting rights of all Texans, and especially for communities of color, through pushing for fair representation during redistricting, opposing discriminatory Voter ID laws, and fighting for the spirit of the Voting Rights Act. If re-elected, I will continue to fight for people’s right to vote.
Redistricting
In 2021, the Texas Legislature will take up redistricting again. Redistricting is very important because Texas has a history of illegally gerrymandering districts to suppress the voting power of communities of color.
In the 2011 redistricting cycle, I offered a redistricting amendment to substantially increase the number of majority minority Texas House districts. I testified for the Department of Justice during the Obama Presidency in Washington D.C. arguing that the Texas House District maps from 2011 were drawn to suppress the voting rights of people of color.
Voter ID Laws
I have always opposed and voted against Texas' discriminatory Voter ID laws. As a reminder, Voter ID laws address a problem that doesn’t actually exist. In order to commit the kind of voter fraud “solved” by Voter ID laws, you would have to know the name of someone registered to vote and cast your ballot for them. Voter fraud is a federal crime. Who would risk going to jail to cast a fraudulent vote? That being said, you won’t be surprised to learn that there are extremely few cases of this occurring.

Celebrating 55 Years of the Voting Rights Act (VRA)
This summer we celebrate the 56th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This landmark legislation may be one of the most impactful pieces of legislation in American History. Without it, the number of people of color in both federal and state legislatures would be much more woefully low. I would not be proudly representing District 147 without the VRA. Even President Obama said, ""I might not be . . . President had it not been for those who courageously helped to pass the Voting Rights Act.”
The VRA took a big hit in 2013 when the Supreme Court regrettably decided to essentially remove the pre-clearance portion of the VRA in Shelby County v. Holder. ""Pre-clearance"" was the process in place that used to require the Justice Department to “pre-clear” election laws passed by certain historically discriminatory states like Texas before those laws could take effect. If pre-clearance had still been on the books after 2013, we would not have had to go through a federal election cycles with discriminatory maps or Voter ID laws in place, because they would never have been approved by the Justice Department. Hopefully the inevitable increase in election laws being found to violate the VRA will restore the will of Congress to re-enact the still-useful pre-clearance requirement.

Breaking: Cook Political Report Shifts Georgia Senate Race Toward Democrats

It's time for a new generation of leadership to clean up this mess.
That's why Democrat Jon Ossoff is running for U.S. Senate to launch an all-out attack on political corruption.
And Jon's opponent, GOP Senator David Perdue, is as crooked as they come:
* He got caught selling meetings for corporate campaign cash and taking illegal corporate campaign contributions.
* He bought stock in a company that produces medical PPE the same day the Senate received a classified briefing on COVID-19, then dumped casino shares to buy vaccine stock while the pandemic bore down on America.
* He took campaign cash from the pharmaceutical industry and then voted against importing cheaper prescription drugs from Canada.
* He traded his stocks 300% more than usual while writing the largest emergency spending bill in American history!
And in the most recent polling Jon Ossoff is beating crooked Perdue by 2%!!
Over the past few months, the people of Georgia have seen Senator Perdue for what he is — a mindless Trump sycophant with no beliefs of his own, a corporate sellout, and a self-dealing influence peddler — the poster boy of Washington corruption.
Jon Ossoff has spent his career exposing corruption and the abuse of power — holding people like David Perdue accountable.
REMEMBER: Jon Ossoff runs a business renowned for its hard-hitting investigations of corruption, organized crime, and war crimes around the world!
Now Jon is running for the U.S. Senate to expose and defeat one of the most corrupt Senators in American history, and he's already leading in the polls.
This is the beginning of a new chapter in our country's history and the beginning of the end for corrupt politicians like David Perdue.

Alex -- I’m asking you for $5 to help me defeat Devin Nunes (Trump’s FAVORITE Congressman). Here’s why:
* Polls are SO CLOSE. And Devin barely won re-election in 2018.
* Trump is scared to death of our campaign. He knows we can really win.
* Republicans are FLOODING Devin Nunes with cash to crush our campaign!
In all honesty, their Republican mega-bucks could sink us. I won’t have the resources to compete without your help.

Trump Pence Make America Great Again
Friend,
It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
For the sake of American strength, jobs, law and order, our lives, and our liberties, we must defeat this radical duo on Election Day. The stakes have never been higher, and we need your help to send a message that this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS.
For the NEXT HOUR, all contributions will be 600%-MATCHED!
Please contribute ANY AMOUNT in the NEXT HOUR to FIGHT for President Trump and your gift will be 600%-MATCHED. >>
Fight for your Country! CONTRIBUTE $20 = $140
CONTRIBUTE $15 = $105
CONTRIBUTE $10 = $70
CONTRIBUTE $5 = $35
CONTRIBUTE ANY AMOUNT
Electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November would be a grave mistake for this Nation with irreversible consequences. They will raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators.
We cannot allow our Nation to go down that path.
President Trump and I are counting on our BEST supporters right now. Can we count on YOU to step up during this critical time?
Please contribute ANY AMOUNT IMMEDIATELY to help us WIN BIG in November and your gift will be instantly 600%-MATCHED.
Thank you,
Vice President Pence Signature Headshot
Mike Pence

P.S. I want you to know that no matter what the Left throws at us, we are not going anywhere. President Trump and I will fight for you every single day. As long as we have YOU on our team, we will WIN on November 3rd. Contribute NOW. >>

✔ Fought against the disastrous bail reform and achieved fixes to add serious crimes back to the list of “qualifying offenses” that are eligible for bail;
✔ Been a leading advocate for improved public transportation on Staten Island and in southern Brooklyn;
✔ Led the effort to secure $151 million in state funding for the East Shore Sea Wall.

News: Biden campaign becomes first major party presidential campaign in U.S. history to complete Hindu American issues questionnaire
For the first time, a major party presidential campaign has responded to a questionnaire posed by a Hindu American group. The Biden campaign responded to our questionnaire in its entirety. The Trump campaign deferred responding.
Full response here: [[URL REDACTED]]
Response highlights:
* Hindu students are bullied because Hinduism is misrepresented in the classroom (cites Hindu American Foundation survey) and because it is under-reported. Would recruit teachers from diverse backgrounds to teach sensitive subjects.
* Calls out hate crimes targeting Hindus.
* ""supports eliminating the limits on employment-based green cards by country, which have kept so many Indian and Hindu families in waiting too long.""
* Remove H1-B visa caps for those working in STEM fields.
* Support Hindu/Indian small business owners.
On Kashmir:
* Joe Biden will have ""no tolerance"" for terrorism in South Asia, ""cross-border or otherwise""
* Committed to work closely with India as a ""counter-terrorism partner"" & strengthen India's defense capabilities
Note: Hindu American PAC did not ask either campaign about #CAA, #Article370, or any issue internal to India - for which no U.S. administration has locus standi to comment. Hindu American PAC remains concerned that these issues were unfavorably mentioned in the campaign's Muslim American community agenda and continues to engage the Biden campaign about these issues.
The Hindu American PAC thanks the Joe Biden campaign for responding to its questionnaire in its entirety and for its engagement. If we hear from the Donald J. Trump campaign on the issues, any such communication will be shared, though the Sept. 10th deadline has elapsed. Since the Trump campaign did not respond to the questionnaire, we will refrain from offering an official endorsement for either campaign.
Please support our work with a donation \- we continue to research and endorse congressional and legislative candidates for the general election, and we will be announcing our general election endorsement list soon.
Thanks again for your support!

Donald Trump
At the RNC, Trump said he's ""done more in three years for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years.""
Let’s check the facts:
\-- He called African nations “sh*thole countries”
\-- He’s told Black Congresswomen to “go back to the crime-infested places of which they came”
\-- And he won’t do ANYTHING to stop police brutality.
So we need EVERY good Democrat to join our fight to END Trump’s racist attacks. We're $27,094 short of our goal to fuel this fight. Donate $5 to stop Trump’s racist attacks now >>
For decades, Black Americans have risked everything to fight for equality.
That fight is FAR from over.
Police are still taking innocent Black lives.
And Trump won’t do anything to help. He’ll just spew racist lies.
The President will not do the right thing unless will force him. We need $45,000 to fund our campaigns. Every dollar will go to electing Black Democrats who will stand up to Trump’s racism.
But if we miss this goal, Trump will continue to ignore us.
So please, don’t wait another minute. Rush $5 to end Trump’s racist and bigoted attacks on Black Americans >>

What’s going to happen if Trump doesn’t get reelected?
The mere thought is horrifying.
Corrupt liberals running the country...
Crime running rampant...
Our men and women in blue shamed and defunded.
Borders wide open...
Guns confiscated...
A tax burden so oppressive mainstream America will be homeless and without food to feed their families.
Health care costs will skyrocket...
The market will crash without hope for a recovery for years...
They’ll pack the Supreme Court and turn America into a socialist country.
Lady Liberty will cry and freedom and justice will be shackled.
I don’t know about you, but these liberals make me so angry I could spit fire.
Nothing but a bunch of lying, conniving, sneaky socialist pigs.
We simply can’t let them win but I’m going to be brutally honest because there’s no other way...
So here goes...
I’m petrified we’re starting to lose the battle...
You know Trump caught Covid-19. And when he did he got really behind in campaigning.
It’s not his fault, it’s not mine and it’s not yours.
But now...
It feels as if Trump’s reelection is slipping through our fingers.
And it has shaken me to the core.
We CAN’T let that happen.
You do want 4 more years of Trump, right?
If so, please sign our Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP.
President Trump needs to know how many Patriots he can count on.
Right now we’re finalizing the list of Patriots who already completed the Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP on Election Day—and we need to know you’re with us.
Please check right now to make certain you’re on the list and not left out. IN fact...
There’s no time to lose because the Official 2020 Pledge to Vote Trump is going to every Republican in Congress tomorrow morning.
Don’t be left off or left out.
We have so little time and so much to do. If Trump doesn’t pull ahead with our help and he loses...
We all lose my friend: our democracy, freedom, jobs, homes, you name [[URL REDACTED]] can kiss it all goodbye.
We’ve got to fight harder, scream louder, round up every Trump supporter we know...
Every undecided sitting on the fence...
And RISE UP.
I’m worried sick. I can’t sleep at night.
Even Ted Cruz is running scared right now.
He came right out and said it...
“I'm worried about the election. I think it's really volatile. I think it could go either way. [[URL REDACTED]] president could win by a big margin and we could win both houses of Congress, [[URL REDACTED]] could be devastating.”
I really need you to sign the Official 2020 Vote Trump Pledge then I beg you...
Give a donation of whatever you can...
When you give by midnight, check right now your donation will get 5X THE IMPACT!
$35 DONATION = 5X THE IMPACT
$50 DONATION = 5X THE IMPACT
$75 DONATION = 5X THE IMPACT
$100 DONATION = 5X THE IMPACT
$250 DONATION = 5X THE IMPACT
$500 DONATION = 5X THE IMPACT
$1000 DONATION = 5X THE IMPACT

Yep, I’ve opened up the 5X THE IMPACT campaign again because of our dire need to ramp up and roll out.
It’s lock and load time, my friend...
Time to pull out the big guns and all the stops.
Do you realize...
Your donation, no matter how big or small, could be the one the helps clinch the WIN for Trump?
The reality is...
We’re fighting a political propaganda machine with an endless stream of money funding it.
In fact, while no one was looking do you know what the Democrats did?
Secretly funneled $170 million in government grants to radical left-wing extremist groups to carry out their dirty work.
The group funding them—the Tides Center—has been flying under the radar for years...
Constantly creating new activist groups—that’s their sole mission.
These radical activist groups are the ones burning our country down.
If this doesn’t make you steamed, I don’t know what will because...
They’re using YOUR tax dollars!!!!
And they’re using them to fund radical extremist groups like Marxist Black Lives Matter Global Network...
Not to mention the Tides Center is an incubator for gun control and abortion rights.
They’re like this giant secretive dark money pit that Democrat donors throw massive amounts of money into.
Need I say more? This is as bad as I’ve ever seen it.
Not only are they using extremist groups now but...
IF Trump loses these radicals are going to overrun the country...
Is that what you want?
I sure as hell don’t.
Look my friend, the liberals and their “super snowflakes” have mega money to burn and...
They’re throwing it at the feet of any radical that will take up their cause: defeat Trump and turn America into a globalist cabal.
Senator Cruz said it best...
""There are a lot of Democrats trying to steal the election...” “The left is showing up. They're pissed off. They hate Trump. We've got to make sure everyone else shows up.”
We need you to show up NOW — not tomorrow or the next day or only on November 3 at the voting booth.
Time is running out fast.
Now I know sometimes people wonder, well what can I do besides vote?
A LOT! This election is riding on YOU, a true Patriot.
I need you to sign the Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP right now and...
Give a donation before midnight for 5X THE IMPACT.
We need it now more than ever! Please don’t let us down.
We’ve got to rally everyone to make this happen—to keep Trump in the Oval Office for another 4 years.
Remember the unimaginable horrors we’ll face if he doesn’t get reelected...
Remember how they removed God from our monuments, schools and military already under Obama? That was just phase 1.
No doubt phase 2 will be the complete eradication of God.
Bibles will be [[URL REDACTED]] of worship will be taxed, putting them out of business...probably boarded up.
That cross around your neck? It’ll become a crime to wear it.
I’m not kidding. This is the liberal horror show—their vision if the Democrats get elected.
There is SO much at stake we can’t sit by and let the liberal loons take control of our beloved country.
It’s up to us.
Please do these 2 things right now:
1\. The Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP—sign here.

Yes, we know the media and pollsters lie but...
You and I can’t take it for granted that Trump is ahead either.
He’s lost ground which is why I opened up the 5X THE IMPACT campaign again.

Are you a TRUE Patriot? If your answer is YES...

Then give a donation for  5X THE IMPACT to help us get out there on the frontlines fighting this battle to the end.
$35, $50, $75, $150 or whatever you can give is great.
It’s a lot to ask in times like these, I know.
But I also know we will all be in financial ruins if Biden wins.
Every donation you give of any amount counts towards helping Trump, the underdog, WIN this election.
Your donation puts our army of Trump supporters on the phone...
...relentlessly blasting our messages across social media...
... churning out faxes and emails...
...putting boots on the ground in DC and across the country...
... organizing rallies, marches and boat parades...
Please think of what America will look like under Biden and his corrupt DemoCRAP cronies.
It’s terrifying.
How badly do you want 4 more years or Trump leading America?
Will your name be on the list of Trump’s TOP supporters going to Republican leaders tomorrow?
Pledge to VOTE TRUMP on November 3rd now.
Then give a donation from the heart—one that says “I Stand With Trump! God Bless America!”
Before you do anything else, ask yourself:

Alex, Trump continues to abuse his power to an extent never before seen in American history:
* He refused to divest from his business interests.
* He pardoned his friends and campaign staffers for crimes they committed in his name.
* He was impeached for abusing the power of the presidency.
* And all that was before his campaign violated federal law by using the White House as the backdrop for the Republican National Convention.
These are not minor issues, they’re serious offenses that demand immediate consequences. Over a third of Americans still stand by Trump and his overreach of executive power – but with only weeks until people begin casting their ballots, we need to know you’re not one of them.

Alex,
As a former Sheriff and law enforcement official for 22 years, I firmly believe that any solutions to reduce violent crime should punish the most dangerous criminals and thugs, not law-abiding gun owners.
As Governor, I’ll continue working closely with local, state, and federal officials to further develop a comprehensive and common-sense approach that cracks down on the most dangerous criminals, strengthens witness protection, and provides law enforcement officials with facilities to deal with mental health patients and get back to protecting their communities faster — doing all while ensuring the protection of law-abiding citizens Second Amendment rights.
I have championed some of the strongest pro-Second Amendment legislation in the country and I have always been proud to receive the NRA’s highest A+ rating and endorsement.

“Rich possesses all the qualities Missourians should demand from their top law enforcement officer: experience prosecuting crimes, a passion for fair and equal justice, and a commitment to protecting the rights of all Missourians. He will be the independent watchdog we need in the Attorney General’s Office.”
Our campaign is proud to have the support of a prosecutor who deeply believes in fighting to administer justice fairly and equally and to protect the rights of all Missouri’s families.
Please join Teresa Hensley in supporting Rich’s campaign today by making a contribution of $25, $50, or whatever you can now.
We appreciate your support.

JUSTICE FOR BREONNA TAYLOR: DEMAND THE INVADING OFFICERS ARE CHARGED WITH MURDER ➞
We need you to remember this name: Breonna Taylor.
Breonna Taylor was an award-winning EMT and First Responder from Louisville, KY who risked her own health and safety to serve her community during Covid-19. Her life mattered.
Breonna Taylor
But Breonna was murdered by the Louisville Police Department at her home while sleeping. They barged in without identifying themselves to look for drugs that were never found and for a person who did not even reside in Breonna’s residence.
Breonna’s life was stolen. But the three police officers who invaded her home are STILL gainfully employed and have yet to be arrested and charged with murder.
The only person who was charged was Breonna’s boyfriend, who shot at the door in self-defense when the officers refused to identify themselves.
We’re beyond disgusted at this horrific disregard for Black life. So we’re calling for justice.
We won’t rest until these offenders are held accountable for their crime. Sign on to demand the invading officers are charged with the murder of Breonna Taylor →
JUSTICE FOR BREONNA TAYLOR: DEMAND THE INVADING OFFICERS ARE CHARGED WITH MURDER ➞
Black Americans, especially Black essential workers like Breonna, deserve the right to sleep peacefully in their own home, free from harm.
This is an injustice that cannot be ignored. And it will take an army of grassroots activists like you, to finally be taken seriously by Kentucky State Officials.

RELEASE
Democrat House Vote on Amnesty Wednesday Designed to Rally Felon Voters
[[URL REDACTED]]
For National Release: December 9, 2019
""ALIPAC is warning candidates, campaigns, and incumbents in Congress that Wednesday's vote on AgJobs Amnesty bill HR 5038 will be a major issue in 2020 elections where large majorities of American oppose Amnesty, and that the real purpose of the bill is for the Democrats to rally their non-citizen voters who are committing felonies by registering and voting for Democrats in 2020.""-- William Gheen, [[URL REDACTED]]
Americans for Legal Immigration Political Action Committee ([[URL REDACTED]]) activists are rapidly contacting incumbent members of Congress and GOP campaigns for public office to warn that America's legal citizens overwhelmingly oppose the AgJobs Amnesty bill HR 5038, which the Democrats have scheduled for a vote this Wednesday where the purpose of the bill is to rally Democrat non-citizen voters who are committing felonies by registering and voting in 2020.
HR 5038 is titled the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2019 and will grant Amnesty, jobs, ID, and voting rights to millions of illegal immigrants currently in the US. ALIPAC warns that passage of HR 5038 will encourage more illegal aliens to enter the US and will encourage current illegals to commit more crimes by registering and voting for Democrats in 2020.
America currently has no significant safeguards in place to prevent non-citizens, including the more than twenty million illegal aliens in the US, from registering to vote and casting ballots for Democrats in 2020, although each action is a federal felony. ALIPAC is documenting the nationwide crisis of non-citizen voters in an online list for use by activists, lawmakers, candidates, and the media. (View List on documented cases of noncitizen voters HERE)
ALIPAC contends that each ballot cast by a non-citizen is a vote stolen from an American voter and is the highest form of civil rights violation as well as a violation of Article IV (section 4) of the US Constitution which requires the ""United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion...""
""Our message to lawmakers and candidates is that the vote on Amnesty bill HR 5038 will be a major issue in the 2020 campaigns where most Americans oppose Amnesty since the elections have the greatest power to stop this Amnesty,"" said William Gheen, of ALIPAC. ""The Democrats want to use this legislation to rally their non-citizen voters who are being registered through left-wing political operations, including the new twenty million dollar voter registration campaign in swing states like North Carolina and Wisconsin funded by open-borders Amnesty advocate and Presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg.""
Democrats just passed an overhaul of the Voting Rights Act last Friday to try to protect their illegal voters and illegal campaign operations registering non-citizen voters for 2020.
They are trying to stop states like North Carolina, where ALIPAC backed state legislation that would have prevented people who say they are non-citizens to avoid jury duty from registering to vote and casting ballots. Pro-Amnesty Democrat Governor Roy Cooper vetoed the bill to protect non-citizen and illegal alien voters in swing state North Carolina!
For more information on ALIPAC's efforts to defeat Amnesty legislation in DC for an 11th time since 2004 and to stop non-citizen voters from stealing US elections and turning all states as socialist blue as California, please visit [[URL REDACTED]] .

66,"Evergreen wildfire, return to school, CO mask order, federal overreach in Portland, and hate crime in Lakewood
Dear Alex,
As we enter the dog days of summer, several things have been weighing on my mind. Chiefly, I’ve heard from a number of educators about their concerns in returning to work. I share these concerns. Quite honestly, if I were the parent of a school age child, I’m not sure what I would do. And I’m deeply concerned about the safety of educators. Combined with the necessity of parents to return to work, there is no question that this is a deeply complex issue. While legislators have no direct authority to make decisions about return dates, remote learning, and in-person safety protocols, I will be having conversations and advocating for the safety of all to the best of my ability.
The other thing that has been troubling me is that Federal agents are descending upon Portland against the objections of state and local leaders, using extreme force and detaining protestors in unmarked vehicles. This is an overreach of the Federal government, and something that should concern all of us who believe in the right to protest and also states’ rights, which were embedded in the constitution by our forefathers as a safeguard against excessive centralized power. We are watching this issue closely, and I signed onto a letter to US Attorney Jason Dunn urging him to take action to protect Colorado from such overreach.
These are interesting times. I believe we can get through them together through dialogue, compromise, creative problem solving and a lot of grace.
Click the picture above for a video from the Evergreen Chamber of Commerce where I and many others thank our brave first responders who kept the people of Evergreen safe and contained the fire!
Elephant Butte Wildfire: On July 13, the Elephant Butte wildfire was spotted in our district. It was contained, thanks to the hard work of our firefighters, and the final area it covered was around 50 acres. Ultimately, around 1,000 homes were evacuated on Monday, and though residents are now allowed back in the area, safety restrictions are still in place in a number of areas and parks. Given the location of our district, wildfires are a frequent problem, which is why I am proud to be in a position to push for stronger protective measures against wildfires and greater assistance for those who are affected by these disasters. Indeed, just this year I sponsored a bill that increases the benefits provided to firefighters like those who contained the Elephant Butte fire. I also put forward two bills that had to be cancelled due to the outbreak of COVID-19: HB20-1142, which would have created a fund to finance a grant program for wildfire mitigation projects by local governments, and HB20-1004, which would have created a grant program to provide resources to landowners for wildfire mitigation. Wildfire response and mitigation is incredibly important to our community, and I will definitely be working to address these issues next session.
Focus on Local Businesses: Our local businesses make up the backbone of our community, and I enjoy working closely with both the Conifer Chamber of Commerce and the Evergreen Chamber of Commerce—both led by strong and capable women (Melanie Swearengin and Betsy Hayes). Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, I’ve tried to work as closely as possible with these two terrific organizations to address the needs of our business community. As the impacts of the pandemic continue to strain our small businesses, I am always available to hear their concerns and to do what I can to help these businesses survive and thrive.
As a legislator, I see my job as protecting and supporting the people of Colorado. As of 2015, 48.6% of Coloradans--just over one million people--were employed by businesses with less than 100 employees. These businesses are the lifeblood of our community, and they are in danger because they are not receiving the same support from the federal government as larger, better resourced and represented corporations. That is why I am doing all that I can to protect and support small businesses in our community at the state level. One of the ways I have done this is through two bills that I have mentioned before. HB20-1413, the CLIMBER Act, establishes a $250 million public-private fund to give below market rate loans to small businesses. Similarly, SB20-222 establishes a $20 million fund using CARES money to give grants to small businesses. Together, these bills provide much-needed support for our small businesses when they need it most.
I’ll be providing information and answering questions around small business legislation next Friday, July 31 with the Conifer Chamber. Check their Facebook page or their event registration page for information on how to join the event if you’re interested in learning more.
Mask Order: As of July 16 at midnight, all people in Colorado who are 11 years or older must wear a covering over their noses and mouths when entering or moving within any public indoor space and while using or waiting to use transportation services (buses, light rail, taxis, and ride-shares). This order is in effect for 30 days, but may be extended.
Here are responses to some common questions and concerns with this order:
* Do I have to wear a mask outdoors? Not unless waiting for non-personal transportation, but it is recommended that you wear a mask whenever you cannot maintain at least 6 feet of distance from other people.
* Does this apply to _____ store? To restaurants? To houses of worship? Yes to all. Masks are required in restaurants except when you are seated at a table. Individuals officiating a religious service are not required to wear masks, but are encouraged to do so if feasible.
* Are rules more or less restrictive in my county or city? Counties and Municipalities may have authority to issue more or less restrictive rules under certain conditions. To check your local rules, look to your local public health agency.
* What will happen if I refuse to wear a mask? You will be in violation of Colorado law and are subject to civil or criminal penalties.
* What are the rules for businesses? Indoor businesses must refuse service to people who are not wearing masks and post signs at entrances instructing customers that they must wear masks. If a business does not comply with the mask order, it is at risk of losing its license.
* Can I get carbon dioxide poisoning or lowered oxygen levels from wearing a mask? According to the Mayo Clinic Health System “for many years, health care providers have worn masks for extended periods of time with no adverse health reactions ... there is no risk of hypoxia, which is lower oxygen levels, in healthy adults. Carbon dioxide will freely diffuse through your mask as you breathe.”
* What is the most recent science behind this order? Masks help those infected from spreading COVID-19 through the partial filtering of infectious particles. Meta-analysis suggests that mask use may reduce infection rates by as much as 65%. For more information on the benefits of universal mask-wearing, please look to: this editorial from the CDC, the CDC’s website, and CDPHE’s website.
Hate Crime in Lakewood: In late April, Lakhwant Singh was brutally attacked outside of the store that he co-owns. I condemn this attack, and sent a letter--signed by most of my Jefferson County legislative colleagues--to District Attorney Pete Weir expressing our full support for his office’s thorough investigation of this attack as a hate crime. Hate does not belong in our community, and I am grateful to be in a position to advocate for justice.
Senator Brittany Pettersen set up a gofundme to help pay for Mr. Singh’s medical bills from the attack. If you are able to contribute to help him and his family in their time of need, please consider doing so.
Take care, and be well!

67,"Donald Trump just said he's ""done more for Black Americans than any other President.""
Donald Trump
At the RNC, Trump said he's ""done more in three years for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years.""
Let’s check the facts:
\-- He called African nations “sh*thole countries”
\-- He’s told Black Congresswomen to “go back to the crime-infested places of which they came”
\-- And he won’t do ANYTHING to stop police brutality.
So we need EVERY good Democrat to join our fight to END Trump’s racist attacks. We're $27,094 short of our goal to fuel this fight. Donate $5 to stop Trump’s racist attacks now >>
For decades, Black Americans have risked everything to fight for equality.
That fight is FAR from over.
Police are still taking innocent Black lives.
And Trump won’t do anything to help. He’ll just spew racist lies.
The President will not do the right thing unless will force him. We need $45,000 to fund our campaigns. Every dollar will go to electing Black Democrats who will stand up to Trump’s racism.
But if we miss this goal, Trump will continue to ignore us.
So please, don’t wait another minute. Rush $5 to end Trump’s racist and bigoted attacks on Black Americans >>

DemocratsJoin us.
I'm the Democratic nominee for one of the two U.S. Senate seats in Georgia -- and we just learned Mitch McConnell’s super PAC is spending more money against me than any other Democratic Senate candidate in America.
This Senate race in Georgia is as close as it gets.
Remember, Stacey Abrams was only defeated here in 2018 by 1.4% -- running against the man who oversaw the election.
McConnell is spending tens of millions of dollars against me because I’m running to reform the corrupt system upon which he’s built his political machine -- a campaign finance system that lets insurance and drug companies, polluters, and ultra-rich political donors write the rules and exploit ordinary people.
My opponent, David Perdue, is the embodiment of that corruption. This man was busy trading medical and vaccine stocks in January and February while he assured us COVID-19 posed low risk to our health. He literally sells meetings at his home for a $7,500 check to the PAC that supports him.
We are exposing my opponent’s flagrant corruption. His campaign is sinking.
That’s why McConnell’s super PAC is spending more against me than any other Democratic U.S. Senate candidate. In Georgia.
To win in this state and overcome notorious voter suppression, we need the strongest technology, data, organizing, and voter protection infrastructure in the country. That means we need a strong effort to support me and the DNC here.
So, with this race neck and neck and so much on the line, will you split a $10 contribution between my campaign and the DNC today so we can mobilize and protect voters in Georgia and in other key states?

I’m an investigative journalist. I run a company that’s exposed corruption, organized crime, war crimes, and human rights abuses worldwide. I will bring that same passion for fighting corruption to Washington, to reform a system broken by corporate PACs, the lobbyist revolving door, and Citizens United.
Americans deserve clean government. And without reform -- as long as corporate PACs and lobbyists call the shots -- we won’t be able to ensure access to great health care, fight climate change and invest in clean energy, or protect Americans from price gouging by drug companies.
But to overcome voter suppression in Georgia, we need a strong Democratic effort from top to bottom.
That’s why I’m asking: Will you split a $10 donation between my campaign for U.S. Senate and the DNC today so we can win this crucial Senate race and seats across the country?

My name is Esti and I’m about to tell you my story. It touches on something very important to all of us, our identity, and how Donald Trump and the people he put in charge of the military tried to take that away from me.
When you're done reading, I hope you’ll sign our petition demanding an end to Donald Trump’s trans ban so that trans members of the military can finally be given the respect and human dignity they deserve.
Imagine constantly living in fear of being outed for your true gender identity and losing your job for living your truth. Maybe that job is supporting your entire family, maybe it’s helping you pay for school, maybe you’ve been working there for years without an issue, or maybe it’s your dream job you worked so hard to get.
Today, the Supreme Court changed that for so many people after making a monumental decision to finally extend workplace protections to the LGBTQ+ under the Civil Rights Act.
While this is a giant step forward for our community, I can’t help but think about the transgender men and women in the military who continue to be told they are unfit to serve solely because of their gender identity — including myself.
As a gender non-conforming individual formerly in the Army, I was a part of the population banned from serving due to Donald Trump’s “trans ban.” This extremely cruel, unjust order forces brave soldiers, willing to lay their life down for their country, to serve in silence, living a lie about who they were.
This cruelty didn’t start when I was banned from serving. The bigotry of intolerance against LGBTQ+ people was rooted deep within the military long before the ban. I was spat on in uniform when I returned home from a tour in Afghanistan for having Transgender and Pride flags on my backpack. I have been yelled at while in uniform to get out of a bathroom, even pulled out by the arm because that person didn’t think I belonged there, even while correctly following the state of North Carolina’s deplorable bathroom bill. And time and time again, people refuse to use my correct pronouns. These stories aren’t unique.
The stereotype of the military is dominated by a culture that centers straight white men, perpetuates the notion that others are not welcome, and contributes to hate against the LGBTQ+ community — whether they are in uniform or not. It’s forced myself and many others to remain afraid to come out, told day after day to reject and hide who they are.
I’m sharing my story, the story of so many of those still in the military facing discrimination every day, to show how serious this issue still is. Transgender soldiers have been serving for decades, and now is our moment to have our voices heard. We have the support, the passion, the drive, and the tools to be able to affect real change.
This is the time to fight for every member of the military forced to live a lie to keep their uniform.
We need you to stand with us, because the time is NOW. Make your voice heard by signing our petition demanding an end to Donald Trump’s trans ban so that trans members of the military can finally be given the respect and human dignity they deserve.
The discrimination, the brutal murders, and the hate crimes against the transgender community won’t end until we finally come together and say enough is enough. We must work together to change the dominant culture of the military that brews this injustice.
Continue to fight for the transgender soldiers still serving and the transgender veterans, like me, who are struggling to pay for transitioning surgery due to healthcare that won't cover it.
We need you. Take just a minute to stand up for this passionate, accepting community willing to by signing our petition to demand the end of Donald Trump’s trans ban.

71,"Mocking transgender Washingtonians is wrong.
I am proud that I was the first Attorney General to challenge President Trump’s transgender military ban.
Today we are in court, with our coalition partners, facing off against President Trump’s Department of Justice. We are fighting for the records that will reveal the Trump Administration’s true motives for the president’s discriminatory policy that prohibits Washingtonians from serving their country because of who they are.
Our values make our state and our country strong.
So let’s talk about Dori Monson, a local, conservative talk radio host.
Last week, Monson sent the following tweet.
“Inslee: we follow science in WA. The state where I could go to Olympia tomorrow and change my birth cert to say I was a girl on 10/2/61 HAHAHAHAHA.”
Let’s be clear — Monson is denying the scientific medical consensus that supports allowing transgender individuals to self-identify. He is openly mocking gender identity.
Transgender individuals are already disproportionately subject to depression, suicide, and hate crimes. Monson’s demeaning remarks contribute to the problem.
The people of Washington deserve better. Join me in sending a message to his employer that these transphobic comments are unacceptable.
Thank you,
Bob

72,"Friend:
This past Monday, a horrible fire devasted our unhoused residents at the Belmont and Kedzie underpass. Although no one was seriously injured or hurt, many of our residents lost all of their belongings. As the media began to publish reports and word of the fire began to spread, so many of you reached out to my office to step up and help out our vulnerable neighbors.
I want to give a special thanks to Avondale Mutual Aid for helping to organize support for the residents at the underpass and for their continued efforts to assist all of our community members in Avondale. Avondale Mutual Aid is a volunteer-driven community group that has been providing assistance to all residents in need since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. I encourage you to learn more about Avondale Mutual Aid and consider joining or donating to their efforts by visiting their Facebook: Avondale Mutual Aid. I also want to thank retired Chicago Police Sergeant Lee Bielecki and the police and fire families of Mount Greenwood, who heard about the fire and delivered a cargo van full of donations for the residents of the Belmont and Kedzie underpass Thursday evening. Lastly, I want to thank the many residents who dropped off items at the underpass and our office throughout the week. We are truly grateful for these kind acts of generosity and for the continued support for our unhoused residents.
It goes without saying that access to affordable and stable housing is key in the fight to end homelessness and to avoid tragic incidents like Monday's fire. I remain committed to supporting dedicated revenue to build housing for our unhoused neighbors. My office will continue to work with the Chicago Fire Department, Department of Family and Support Services, Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, encampment residents, and neighbors to keep our community safe.
In solidarity,
Carlos Ramirez-Rosa

73,"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
Trump Pence Make America Great Again
Friend,
It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
For the sake of American strength, jobs, law and order, our lives, and our liberties, we must defeat this radical duo on Election Day. The stakes have never been higher, and we need your help to send a message that this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS.
For the NEXT HOUR, all contributions will be 600%-MATCHED!
Please contribute ANY AMOUNT in the NEXT HOUR to FIGHT for President Trump and your gift will be 600%-MATCHED. >>
Fight for your Country! CONTRIBUTE $20 = $140
CONTRIBUTE $15 = $105
CONTRIBUTE $10 = $70
CONTRIBUTE $5 = $35
CONTRIBUTE ANY AMOUNT
Electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November would be a grave mistake for this Nation with irreversible consequences. They will raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators.
We cannot allow our Nation to go down that path.
President Trump and I are counting on our BEST supporters right now. Can we count on YOU to step up during this critical time?
Please contribute ANY AMOUNT IMMEDIATELY to help us WIN BIG in November and your gift will be instantly 600%-MATCHED.
Thank you,
Vice President Pence Signature Headshot
Mike Pence
Vice President of the United States
P.S. I want you to know that no matter what the Left throws at us, we are not going anywhere. President Trump and I will fight for you every single day. As long as we have YOU on our team, we will WIN on November 3rd. Contribute NOW. >>

Fellow Conservative,
Our FINAL Mid-Month Deadline is 3 days away, and we need it to be BIG.
Critical funds for battleground races are SEVERELY LOW and if we don’t absolutely CRUSH this deadline, Trump and his allies COULD LOSE.
That’s why we’ve activated EMERGENCY 6X-MATCHING until MIDNIGHT to make every single dollar go SIX TIMES as far. Can we count on you to step up?
Time is running out!
600% MATCH NOW
You know the ENORMOUS stakes of this election— and that it’s going to take every Trump patriot in America stepping up NOW if we want to save our country.
Fellow Conservative, it has never been more important to secure President Donald J. Trump a huge victory.
If we FAIL to CRUSH our FINAL MID-MONTH DEADLINE, that might not just cost us the election, it could cost us our DEMOCRACY.
Stand With Trump
We have never been closer to living in a socialist America. You see it everywhere you look. Democrats aren’t even trying to hide it anymore.
The Democrats even told us what they’re going to do:
⚠️ Defund the police.
⚠️ Raise Taxes by TRILLIONS, ruining our economic recovery and destroying 401k’s and retirement.
⚠️ Extend lockdowns indefinitely.
⚠️ Cripple private health insurance in favor of government-run health care.
⚠️ Pack the Supreme Court
If we don’t act NOW to support our President and restore Trump’s majority, the left will continue forcing their failed agenda on the lives of all AMERICANS.
Do you want to continue to live in a country where our Congress is run by a left-wing mob who denies their failed policies, evades questions that matter to Americans, and ignores the anarchy and chaos that has led to crime spikes like we’ve never seen?
If you don’t —GOOD. Do something about it.
We need all hands on deck if we want to stage the biggest upset in American history.
We need YOU, Fellow Conservative.
Make no mistake, we are the underdog going into this election, but with your help, we can pull off another HISTORIC victory.
Stand With Trump
Make an investment in your family’s future. A donation of $5, $10, $35, $100, or even $500 or more could make all the difference. Everything you give will go 600% as far.
