BREAKING NEWS: ADAM SCHIFF REPORTS “REAL PROSPECT OF JAIL TIME” FOR TRUMP POST‑PRESIDENCY
Adam Schiff
Do you think Donald Trump should be put on trial for his crimes after leaving office?
YES >>
NO >>

3 MINUTES REMAINING
This is an official Stop Republicans opinion poll. Please respond even if you are “Unsure”. You have 3 minutes to submit your answer.
Donald Trump has been abusing his position since the first day he became president.
He’s used his power and influence to end criminal investigations and avoid conviction.
And listen, enough is enough. Trump needs to be held accountable for his crimes.
But Congress will only charge Trump if it’s what the American people want.
That’s why we’re issuing an urgent public opinion poll today to gauge what our top supporters think. And we really need to hear from you:

51,"It doesn't have to be this way.
Alex, let's talk about Roe v. Wade.
This historic decision affirmed that women have a right to privacy when they make deeply personal health care decisions, and that the government must not infringe upon that autonomy.
This is about fundamental human rights.
And yet, Donald Trump will almost certainly nominate a Supreme Court justice committed to overturning Roe v. Wade and allowing politicians to intervene in women's health care.
The decision to terminate a pregnancy is a deeply personal one. It belongs to individual women, who know themselves and their own health -- not to politicians who would impose their personal views.
I run a business that investigates organized crime and corruption for news organizations worldwide, and we have investigated and exposed how dangerous, unqualified, and unregulated abortion providers kill thousands of women in places where safe abortion services are not available legally.
I will fight with every bone in my body to protect the privacy of women's health care in America, Alex.
This is not about partisan politics -- it's about health, human rights, and privacy from government intrusion.
As Senator, I will only vote to confirm federal judges who pledge to uphold Roe v. Wade.
But I am running against a limitlessly-funded extremist who is so arrogant, he believes he is entitled to make these decisions for women in Georgia. If he is elected to another six-year term in the Senate, he will vote to confirm dozens of federal judges who will seize and destroy women's right to privacy in health care and to safe, legal abortion. Please help me win this race so I can fight to defend Roe v. Wade in the United States Senate.

Here's an update –
After blocking key witnesses from testifying in front of the Senate, Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans have voted to acquit President Trump of all charges.
Simply put, this is a shameless abuse of power by the GOP Senate majority in order to protect Trump at all costs. The American people deserve the full story about the crimes that led House Democrats to impeach Donald Trump, and now they may never get it.
This vote – and Trump's actions since that day – show that Trump and the Republicans think they're untouchable. But they're not. If we organize and mobilize more than ever before, we WILL make state Republicans pay for this at the ballot box in November.
If Republicans won't hold Trump accountable, then it's up to us to take action. Chip in right now to help defeat Trump's allies in the states and send a clear, unambiguous signal that GOP legislators will pay a price for ignoring the Constitution >>

With Senate Republicans refusing to even hold a fair trial, this case was doomed from the start. And now that Trump's been acquitted, the GOP's true colors have never been clearer.
Republicans aren't working for the best interests of Americans – they're willing to protect Trump at any and all costs.
But Mitch McConnell doesn't get the final word here: You do. This year's elections give us the chance to oust Trump and his Republican allies. Not just the senators who helped cover up Trump's crimes, but Republicans at every level who are complicit in the GOP's cruel and corrupt agenda.
It's up to us to make state Republicans pay for their blatant abuse of power. Pitch in now so we can finally hold the Republicans who support Trump accountable for their actions.

55,"The tragic death of Eric Garner was six years before the murder of George Floyd earlier this year. Both men's last words were ""I can't breathe"".
Melissa Watson Logo
Hello Friends,
Six years ago today, on July 17, 2014, a man named Eric Garner died in New York City's Staten Island when an NYPD police officer put him in a chokehold while arresting him. (Chokeholds banned by the NYPD in 1993.) Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who murdered Garner, walked free of criminal charges.
This tragedy was six years before the murder of George Floyd earlier this year when a cop held him to the ground with a knee at his neck for 9 minutes.
Both men were unarmed, both were being brought in on non-violent crimes, both men were Black — and both men uttered the very same final words: ""I can't breathe"" before having their lives taken from them by police officers.
These words, “I can’t breathe,” have become a rallying cry the stifling harm that systemic racism has posed on Black Americans, particularly and most horrifyingly, from our law enforcement — those who are meant to protect us.
We must make criminal justice and police reform a priority and elect leaders who understand the urgency of such change. I plan to seek justice for Eric, George, and too many others who have lost their lives from the systemic racism within our establishments. There is so much left to fight for.
If I were in Congress right now, I would start by pushing for the Democratic Justice in Policing Act, which has already passed the House. This bill includes banning chokeholds and limiting no-knock warrants, and it also requires police departments to submit data on their practices to the federal government. In America, we should not have TWO systems of justice. Everyone should be subject to the same rule of law \-- and I hope to continue this fight in Washington.
But for today, please keep Eric Garner and his family in your thoughts and continue your fight for racial justice.
Together, we can do better.
Melissa

56,"Alex,
Did you see the news? Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser, was arrested and charged with FRAUD for the “Build the Wall” GoFundMe scam.
This is just another example of Trump’s corruption and how he has surrounded himself with crooks and criminals -- and their behavior is all enabled by the rogue Attorney General, Bill Barr.
While Trump calls himself the president of “law and order”, it’s clear that he and his cronies believe they’re above the law. We cannot afford four more years of criminal activity in the White House, and we can’t afford to have any enablers of this behavior in Congress.
I’m running for re-election to stand up against this lawlessness. Could you send over a donation to my campaign so I can keep fighting in Congress to hold all of these people and their enablers accountable for their crimes?
DONATE NOW >>
It is truly disturbing how many Trump associates have been arrested, charged and found guilty of crimes -- from Paul Manafort to Rick Gates, Michael Flynn and now Steve Bannon? And somehow they all seem to be getting sweetheart deals courtesy of AG William Barr... We must defeat this corruption and bring decency back.
I’m appalled that people so close to the White House and president have been involved in so many criminal activities. This is insulting to the office of the president, and insulting to the people of America who want leaders that surround themselves with good, decent people.
We have choices to make when it comes to the leaders we want to represent us in Congress, and in the White House. Having criminals in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue who are enriching themselves for personal gain or lying to cover up the president’s crimes cannot stand.
Please make a contribution to my campaign today if you can -- every dollar counts and will help re-elect me to represent Georgia’s 4th district once again, and I couldn’t be prouder to stand with you and against this corruption.

## ATF Seeks to Help Elect Biden Because It’s Good for Gun Control
Dear Alex,
In an apparent reversal of a longstanding interpretation of the statutory and regulatory definition of “handguns” under the Gun Control Act (GCA), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is ready to stick it to gun owners.
It appears the ATF has determined that certain handguns which fire ammunition that is traditionally used in rifles – or handguns made from receivers that have also been used to produce rifles (including many of the AR or AK variant) – are not eligible for importation.
The agency seems to have determined this by using novel and restrictive standards in a revised importation test, which is arbitrarily used to evaluate whether a weapon meets the statutory “sporting purposes” requirement. Congress has never defined what “sporting purposes” means.
The ATF also apparently suggested that legally-imported firearms “may wrongly have been approved for importation” and that these “firearms may require reevaluation.”
While the scope of this suggested “reevaluation” is not clear, if the GCA interpretation is applied for purposes of domestic firearms, then such weapons could meet the National Firearms Act (NFA) definition of “Any Other Weapon (AOW).” If certain firearms were determined to be AOWs, the firearms would be subjected to mandatory registration, taxation, travel restrictions and a lengthy post-purchase, pre-delivery waiting period. Gun owners would then be subject to criminal prosecution for possession of an unregistered NFA weapon, a charge that carries a punishment of up to ten years of imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
GOA Senior Vice President Erich Pratt stated the following:
> Despite an executive action from President Trump prohibiting the imposition of ‘new standards’ without express authorization by law, the apparent interpretation by a rogue and reckless ATF has implications that could criminalize millions of otherwise non-violent and law-abiding gun owners. This continues to demonstrate why the National Firearms Act should be repealed and the agency itself should be fully dismantled.
>
> It also demonstrates why President Trump recently issued an Executive Order creating a new classification of ‘Schedule F’ employees. This new classification allows the President to ‘drain the swamp’ by firing policy-making employees who would rather go rogue than follow the law.
>
> The recent Honey Badger gun ban and revelation of absurd private classification rulings represents a pro-Biden ‘October Surprise’ by an out-of-control, anti-gun ATF.
>
> By disregarding orders to stand down, rogue ATF agents seem prepared to help usher in a Joe Biden Administration, especially because their actions appear to be purposefully timed to anger President Trump’s base immediately before an election.
>
> ATF’s actions are just a taste of what is to come in Joe Biden’s gun controlled-America. The Biden gun control plan seeks to treat many commonly-owned, semi-automatic rifles as NFA weapons, which endangers the freedom of tens of millions of peaceful individuals who own these guns, possession in and of itself should not be a crime.

62,"Today, I voted to acquit President Donald Trump on both articles of impeachment in the United States Senate. [[URL REDACTED]]
Dear Alex,
Today, I voted to acquit President Donald Trump on both articles of impeachment in the United States Senate.
First, I am glad the Senate soundly rejected impeachment and did not remove President Trump from office.
The articles of impeachment brought to the Senate from the Democrats in the House of Representatives represent an assault on the presidency itself and the weaponization of impeachment as a political tool.
I also believe that the impeachment effort was driven by a level of partisanship and 'Ends Justify the Means' behavior the American people have rejected.
The proper way to end this matter was a vote to acquit and allow the American people to vote for or against President Trump in November – not to remove him from office and prevent him from running for reelection.
Finally, I have detailed my views below if you want additional information about how I reached my decision on this important vote.
Sincerely,
Lindsey Graham
Lindsey Graham
United States Senator
* * *
THE PROCESS USED IN THE HOUSE TO CONSTRUCT THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT WAS FLAWED:
I feel compelled to condemn the impeachment process used in the House of Representatives because I believe it was devoid of basic, fundamental due process.
This impeachment was completed within 78 days and had a spirit of partisanship and revenge that, if accepted by the Senate, would lead to the weaponization of impeachment against future presidents.
In the House of Representatives:
* President Trump was entirely shut out of the evidence gathering stage in the House Intelligence Committee.
* President Trump was denied the right to counsel, right to cross-examine, and right to call witnesses.
* Much of the evidence gathered against President Trump by the House Intelligence Committee consisted of inadmissible hearsay.
* The House Judiciary Committee Impeachment hearings were, for lack of a better term, a sham.
More importantly, during the Senate trial the House managers admitted the reason they did not seek testimony from President Trump's closest advisers – former National Security Adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney – was because it would have required them to go to court and slowed their effort to impeach President Trump before the presidential election began.
It was a calculated decision to deal the courts out of President Trump's impeachment inquiry due to a political timetable.
With today's Senate vote to acquit President Trump, I hope the Senate has sent a clear message that this should never, ever happen again.
THE CASE AGAINST THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT:
As to the substance of the allegations against President Trump:
The Obstruction of Congress article is literally impeaching the President because he chose to follow the advice of the White House Counsel, the Department of Justice and was willing to use constitutional privileges in a manner consistent with every other president.
This article should be soundly rejected, not only in this case, but also in the future. Whether one likes President Trump or not, he is the president and has privileges attached to his office. To impeach him for exercising those privileges is unprecedented.
The Abuse of Power article of impeachment is beyond vague, does not allege criminal misconduct, and requires the Senate to engage in a subjective analysis of President Trump's motives and actions. It also represents an existential threat to the presidency.
The House managers argued the sole and exclusive purpose of freezing aid to Ukraine was for the private, political benefit of President Trump. It is clear to me that there is ample evidence that the actions of Hunter Biden and Vice President Biden were inappropriate and undercut American foreign policy.
Moreover, there was evidence in the record that officials in Ukraine were actively speaking against candidate Trump and were pulling for former Secretary of State Clinton. Based on the overwhelming amount of evidence of inappropriate behavior by the Bidens and statements by State Department officials about certain Ukrainians' beliefs that one American candidate would be better than the other would, I found it eminently reasonable for the President to be concerned about corruption in Ukraine, election interference, and the behavior of Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter.
It remains hard for me to believe that Vice President Biden was an effective messenger for reform efforts in Ukraine while his son Hunter was receiving $3 million from Burisma, one of Ukraine's most corrupt companies.
It is obvious to me that after the Mueller Report, President Trump viewed the House impeachment inquiry as a gross double standard when it comes to investigations. The House launched an investigation into his phone call with President Zelensky. At the same time, the House showed no interest in the actions of Vice President Biden and Hunter Biden.
The President, in my view, was justified in asking the Ukrainians to look into the circumstances surrounding the firing of Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma, and whether his termination benefited Hunter Biden and Burisma.
It is clear to me that the phone call focused on burden sharing, corruption, and election interference in an appropriate manner. The most vexing question was how President Trump was supposed to deal with these legitimate concerns.
THE HOUSE DOUBLE STANDARD:
The House managers suggest that President Trump could not have asked the Attorney General to investigate these concerns because that would be equivalent to President Trump asking for an investigation of a political rival. However, in the next moment, the House managers declare the proper way for President Trump to deal with those allegations would have been to ask the Attorney General to investigate.
They cannot have it both ways.
I believe that it is fair to criticize President Trump's over-reliance on his private attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate alleged corruption and conflicts of interest regarding the Bidens and Burisma. However, I do not find this to be a remotely impeachable offense and believe it would be beneficial for the country to find other ways to deal with such matters in the future.
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT CASE DOES NOT MEET REMOVAL STANDARD:
Assuming the facts — in the light most favorable to the House managers – that for a period of time the aid was suspended by President Trump to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and election interference, I find both articles fail as impeachable offenses.
I find this to be the case even if we assume additional facts from Mr. Bolton are accurate.
The simple fact is the Ukrainians received the military aid and did not open the requested investigation.
The allegations contained in this impeachment are not what the Founding Fathers had in mind as high crimes or misdemeanors. Our Founding Fathers, in my view, envisioned serious, criminal misconduct that would shake the foundation of the American constitutional system.
The Nixon Impeachment had broad, bipartisan support once the facts were revealed. The Clinton Impeachment started with bipartisan support in the House and ended with bipartisan support in the Senate, even though it fell well short of the two-thirds vote required to remove a president.
I hope my decision to vote not guilty on both articles of impeachment is seen as a rejection of WHAT the House of Representatives did and HOW they did it.
To remove a President from office requires conduct that shakes the very foundation of our constitutional system.
This impeachment effort fell far short of that high standard.

64,"Four years ago today, ISIS terrorist Omar Mateen gunned down 49 people in the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Florida.
Laura Loomer for Congress
Patriot,
Four years ago today, ISIS terrorist Omar Mateen gunned down 49 people in the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Florida.
Following the terrorist attack, the media and Democrat politicians labeled it a hate crime against the LGBTQ community and immediately began the call to restrict our Second Amendment rights.
But their narrative was misleading.
After failing to gain entry to Disney World, Mateen’s original target, he chose Pulse nightclub as the location of his terrorist attack.
The Islamic terrorist was outraged by the killing of ISIS leader Abu Waheeb a month earlier, which is why he stormed the gay nightclub, massacring 49 people, holding others hostage, while pledging allegiance to ISIS.
But democrats still deny it was an act of Islamic terrorism to this day.
Ilhan Omar posted on Twitter, ""Let’s remember the attack for what it was: a hate crime against the LGBTQIA+ community.""
Just hours ago, Nancy Pelosi called it a ""shocking act of hatred.""
Other Democrats like my opponent Lois Frankel are refusing to admit this was an act of Islamic terrorism, and are instead attacking law abiding gun owners.
Islamic Terrorism doesn’t fit the narrative of Democrats in this critical election year. Their ""hate America"" agenda bolsters terrorists and some Democrats like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib work directly with groups that are officially designated as terrorist organizations. Ilhan Omar once advocated for nine men in her district who joined ISIS, asking a judge to lessen their sentencing.
This is why I’m headed to Washington. And I need your help to get there.
Help me honor the American lives lost to Islamic Terrorism by allowing me to actively fight against those who would go so far as to change the narrative to fit their agenda.
I have to go back to Ilhan Omar’s quote, ""Let’s remember the attack for what it was . . . ""
That’s a shameful, outrageous lie!
FOURTY-NINE lives were lost on this day four years ago. FOURTY-NINE men and women were stalked and many were shot at point blank range by an ISIS TERRORIST.
Let’s not forget the attack for what it was . . . ISLAMIC TERRORISM.
Help me get to Washington so that next year, on the fifth anniversary of this attack, I can remind Ilhan Omar and hand her the names of the men and women killed by an ISIS terrorist.
Thank you again for all that you do.
Respectfully,
Laura Loomer

Alex,
I knew that when I signed up to run for Congress as a Black female Republican it wouldn’t be easy. Running for public office requires for one to put it all on the line.
For the past 25 years, I’ve spent my time raising five children and educating the children of my fellow Americans. I have no dirty laundry of which to speak – however, it does take some getting used to seeing your name in the newspaper, your face on a website, or in digital ads.
But the most challenging part of running for Congress as a conservative Republican woman is the names, the insults and the racial slurs the trolls on the internet have lobbed my way, seemingly only for one of two reasons:
1. Because I’m a female Republican of color with views of my own – which often diverge with others in the Black community.
2. Because racism is alive and well in the United States.

I have thick skin – these comments don’t bother me personally. What does bother me is that there are people out there that don’t seem to believe there is a place for a conservative like me in the Republican Party – or because of the color of my skin I’m expected to be a Democrat.
Some of the comments above are, indeed, from self-identified Democrats. Say what you want about President Trump, but …
* Would a racist president stand for pro-life legislation when the majority of babies impacted by abortion are babies with disabilities and babies of color?
* Would a racist prioritize reducing prison sentences for non-violent crimes which disproportionately affect minority communities?
* Would a racist give the most money to historically black colleges and universities of any recent president?
As Republicans, we should be so proud.

70,"SCOTUS Protects Gender Identity & Sexual Orientation Against
Workplace Discrimination
Dear Friend,
Today, the Supreme Court delivered a landmark win for equality and justice in our country. In a 6-3 decision, the Court ruled that gender identity and sexual orientation are protected from workplace discrimination under Title VII of the Civil RIghts Act of 1964. Discrimination against LGBTQ persons, however, continues and is a goal of the current Administration and its supporters in Congress, including Jackie Walorski.
The decision highlights what is at stake in November. Jackie Walorski is virulently anti-LGBTQ. Pat Hackett will be the first openly LGBTQ member of Congress from Indiana and believes in Dignity and Justice for All. Unlike Jackie, Pat understands that discrimination is not a Hoosier or American value.
In 2016, Jackie offered her full support to the Russell Amendment, a horrific piece of legislation that made government funding of discrimination against LGBTQ persons under the guise of religious liberty perfectly legal. Jackie’s view was extreme and out of step with the bipartisan main. Jackie also opposed marriage equality and hate crime legislation that includes LGBTQ protections. She continues to oppose the Equality Act.
Jackie is out of step with the goodness of the people of this District. She is harmful to LGBTQ families and proud in her support of the Pence/Trump Administration. Can you invest in our campaign to send Pat Hackett to Washington as our Representative and advocate for Dignity and Justice for All?

Friend,
The future of our country and our state is on the line. Chaos, anarchy and violent crime has gripped cities across New York and our leaders have turned their backs on the brave heroes in law enforcement who keep us safe.
While Cuomo, de Blasio and New York Democrats seek to limit the rights and freedoms of law-abiding New Yorkers, dangerous criminals are allowed free rein.
That is why I am writing to you today to ask you to renew your New York Republican Party membership for the 2020 election cycle.
This is no time to sit back--our mission is more critical than ever. Democrats in New York have already delivered a disastrous end to bail laws that are putting violent criminals right back onto the streets. They have already gutted the NYPD's budget and they won't be happy until they have completely dismantled everything that makes our country so special.
We’re counting on loyal members like you to help us ensure our strong Republican candidates have the resources they need to fight back against this extremism.
According to our records, you have not yet renewed your New York Republican Party membership for the 2020 election cycle.
Make sure you stand up and are counted. If you don’t renew soon, you will miss access to critical information about the 2020 election cycle, including President Trump’s reelection and our important congressional and state legislative races.
You must act now.
Get your exclusive 2020 NYGOP Membership Card TODAY!
President Trump is counting on us to deliver him a big re-election victory, and he told me personally how important it is to him to win right here in New York.
We worked tirelessly to recruit strong Republicans to run for office and I’m so excited about the slate of new fighters who are running this year to restore common sense and balance to government.
Everything is on the line.
Restoring two-party government is essential to New York’s future. Our wins this year will preserve the New York Republican Party for the next decade after redistricting.
Democrats’ extreme policies have already driven more than a million New Yorkers to other states and we are facing an even greater mass exodus thanks to coronavirus and the unraveling of our public safety.
We cannot afford to let this radical agenda gain a permanent foothold in New York.
We can stop all of this NOW, and we WILL.
It’s time for common sense to make a comeback in New York and it starts now with the NYGOP.
As a sustaining 2020 member, you will play a vital role in our New York GOP operations. If we’re going to win again, we’re going to need every member to renew their commitment to the NYGOP.
Can we count on you to renew your 2020 New York Republican membership today with a generous donation of $25 today? When we receive your contribution, we will ship you an exclusive 2020 membership card.
FOR $25 SECURE YOUR OFFICIAL 2020 REPUBLICAN MEMBERSHIP TODAY
Your membership goes directly toward helping our Republican candidates WIN. Please contribute $25 or more to ensure our New York Republican Party can deliver big victories this November.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Nick Langworthy,
Chairman of the NYGOP

We need to win nine races to flip the Texas House
We have 22 opportunities to do so. And if we do, then we can change Texas politics for a decade.
Imagine the impact of a progressive Texas Legislature leading redistricting. That means expanding Medicaid, increasing funding for public schools, using the Texas Rainy Day Fund to help every day Texans, and more.
We can do it. Many of these seats overlap several counties so if you live in a red, blue, or purple county at the presidential level - every vote counts at the legislative level!

# More Progress
Whether Dan Patrick agrees or not, it is time to take down Confederate monuments across Texas.
This week the RNC featured one of Trump’s favorite congressmen, Dan Crenshaw. We didn’t want to hear from him, so we gave the spotlight to his progressive challenger, Sima Ladjevardian.
Gov. Abbott was right to expand early vote by a week, but now Republicans are suing to take it away. Even when they get something right, they find a way to screw it up!
There has been a 700% increase in crimes committed by White House advisors during Trump Administration. Putting him in charge for “law and order” is like asking the wolf to guard the sheep.
Progress Texas is looking for a communications intern to join our team for the fall semester. Interns will receive $15/hour and the position is remote. Apply today!

Lerah Lee for Congress
Alex,
I knew that when I signed up to run for Congress it wouldn’t be easy. Running for public office requires for one to put it all on the line.
For the past 25 years, I’ve spent my time raising five children and educating the children of my fellow Americans. I have no dirty laundry of which to speak – however, it does take some getting used to seeing your name in the newspaper, your face on a website, or in digital ads.
But the most challenging part of running for Congress as a conservative Republican woman is the names, the insults and the racial slurs the trolls on the internet have lobbed my way, seemingly only for one of two reasons:
1. Because I’m a female Republican of color with views of my own – which often diverge with others in the Black community.
2. Because racism is alive and well in the United States.
Send A Black Conservative
To Congress
Notice some of the more eloquent comments I’ve received in feedback from previous emails I’ve sent out to you and others around the country: ALERT: if you have an aversion to foul language – STOP reading now.
Notable Comments:
* “Truth is you’re just a “n****r”
* As far as reparations are concerned, the N*****S owe the white man reparations
* “You are screwed to believe Republicans will ever do any good for anyone but themselves”
* “Turn coat, Uncle Tom”
* “You’re a f******g uncle Thomasina dancing for the GOP”
* “F**k Off Racist “B***H”
* “Sellout”
* “I am for no black that is racist. And you sure are”
Stand Against Racism
Donate Today
I have thick skin – these comments don’t bother me personally. What does bother me is that there are people out there that don’t seem to believe there is a place for a conservative like me in the Republican Party – or because of the color of my skin I’m expected to be a Democrat.
Some of the comments above are, indeed, from self-identified Democrats. Say what you want about President Trump, but …
* Would a racist president stand for pro-life legislation when the majority of babies impacted by abortion are babies with disabilities and babies of color?
* Would a racist prioritize reducing prison sentences for non-violent crimes which disproportionately affect minority communities?
* Would a racist give the most money to historically black colleges and universities of any recent president?
As Republicans, we should be so proud.
Send a Black Conservative
To Congress »
Just like EVERY OTHER AMERICAN, I’m entitled to my own opinion and my choice of political party.
Like every other email requesting financial support for my campaign that I’ve sent out, I fully expect to receive negative feedback.
What I won’t tolerate is being the target of racial slurs simply because of what I stand for.
If you’re pro-life, pro-business, a supporter of limited government and want to keep your private health insurance – then I’m asking you to stand with me today so that I can go to Washington to fight for you!
I'm so grateful to you, Alex,
Blessings always,

Breonna Taylor was a public servant. She served her community as an EMT and she was murdered by police while sleeping in her own bed.
Breonna's life was stolen. But two of the police officers who committed this heinous act will walk free without consequence. It's despicable.

Business Insider explains it best: (we’ve included the most important parts)
Business Insider: Trump Reportedly Rejected Approving a Bailout Package that would Rescue the US Postal Service, and It Could Be a Disaster for States Trying to Expand Voting by Mail
The United States has plunged the US Postal Service into dire financial straits, as more Americans than ever rely on post offices to deliver necessary medicine and supplies, especially in underserved rural areas.
House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Gerry Conolly, who runs the subcommittee that oversees the Postal Service, sounded the alarm that the agency could run out of funding altogether by June if Congress doesn’t act soon.
'Based on a number of briefings and warnings this week about a critical fall-off in mail across the country, it has become clear that the Postal Service will not survive the summer without immediate help from Congress and the White House,' the two said in a March 23 joint statement, calling on Congress to appropriate $25 million in emergency funds to the agency.

As states have steadily expanded absentee and mail-in voting over the past two decades, the proportion of Americans voting in-person on election day has declined from 90% in 1992 to 60% in 2016, according to the US Census Bureau.
But some Republicans have openly protested expanding vote by mail options because they believe it would hurt them politically.  Trump said in a recent 'Fox & Friends' appearance that the House's stimulus provisions had 'levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.'
Since then, Trump has continued to spread misinformation about the safety and security of voting by mail on his Twitter account, falsely claiming that it 'substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD,' which none of the available evidence on vote by mail supports.

The U.S. Postal Service is a critical and beloved institution.
And their role in delivering millions of mail-in ballots this November will prove to be critical to the 2020 Election.

81,"We should be voting out and defunding politicians like Ellen Jaffee who created this mess in the first place.
Hello Alex,
The recent rise in crime in New York City is a direct result of the disastrous policies being implemented by state and local officials.
Non-enforcement of “petty” crimes.
Cashless bail for “non-violent” criminals.
Parole for unrepentant cop killers and child sex offenders.
Is it any wonder why New York is becoming less safe?
And yet, Bill de Blasio and the City Council are talking about defunding the NYPD to the tune of $1 BILLION!
DEFUNDING THE POLICE? GET REAL!
Chip in now to help STOP these disastrous policies!
WATCH MY VIDEO ON THE ""DEFUND THE POLICE"" MOVEMENT
For too long, Albany and New York City politicians have covered up their failed policies on education, housing, poverty, drug addiction, and mental health by passing on those responsibilities to law enforcement – and then throwing police officers under the bus at the first sign of controversy.
We need real reform if we want to address the root problems of inequality and injustice.
We need good paying jobs for all New Yorkers; a quality education for every child; access to affordable health care; and safe neighborhoods to live in.
Rather than defund the police, we should be voting out and defunding politicians, like my opponent Ellen Jaffee, who helped create this mess in the first place.
CHIP IN $25
CHIP IN $50
CHIP IN $100
CHIP IN $500
CHIP IN $1,000
Together, let's send a message to the politicians in Albany and New York City that defunding the police is not just bad policy, it's downright dangerous!
Stay safe!

Patriot,
With all their guns aimed at Tucker Carlson, you’d think the radical Left would have their hands full.
But no…
They’ve now turned their guns ALSO on Sean Hannity in hopes they can kill two birds with one socialist stone.
Ever since Donald Trump won on election night in 2016, Barack Obama’s political network has been in socialist revolution mode.
And Hannity has called them out on it!
That’s why they hate him so much…he’s exposing their lies, corruption and Deep State collusion against President Trump.
We're rallying the Tea Party troops to launch our counter-revolution against the radical Left to circle the wagons for Hannity...
…because they just ESCALATED their plan to take him out, too.
##  SIGN THE PETITION:
DEFEND HANNITY!
Just this week Hannity called out the radical leftist Democrats for their failed leadership:
> ""We have Pelosi. We have Schumer. We have Biden. 125 years of swamp failure. They have done nothing to quell inner-city violent crime anywhere in America, nothing to fix the broken dilapidated disgusting and repulsive educational system. They have failed America's children. We have far left mayors. They have ruled these cities for decades. They have completely failed their citizens.""
They HATE Hannity for exposing the truth!
So in order to shut him up, they’ve launched a scandalous — completely bogus — lawsuit against both Hannity and Tucker...
…they recruited a disgruntled former employee to make scurrilous claims of harassment at Fox News…which “have no basis in fact whatsoever.""
But the truth has never gotten in the way of the radical Left’s plan to entirely destroy conservative patriots and remove them from the airways!
The problem is, if we don’t step up and defend Hannity alongside our defense of Tucker, it’s only a matter of time before they prevail!
If you think this is just fear-mongering, think again. This is EXACTLY how they took down Bill O’Reilly!
With O’Reilly’s head on a proverbial pike, they’re foaming at the mouth to lop off Hannity’s head, too.
If we lose Hannity’s critical voice, cutting through lies and deception from the Left, President Trump’s ability to counteract the fake news media will be severely muted ahead of November.
That's why I need you to sign Hannity's petition right now and join the counter-revolution to keep him on the air. Will you sign?

CEO, [[URL REDACTED]]

Claudia for Congress
Friend,
Americans in big cities across the country are suffering under the weight of rising crime right now, and it’s easy to see why.
Democrat mayors in charge of Seattle, Chicago, and New York – just to name a few – have abandoned their police officers and let lawlessness, looting, and violence take over their cities.
Now, Anthony Brindisi is working with Nancy Pelosi to let lawlessness take over our own district by voting to defund the police and voting to release dangerous prisoners early.
Not on my watch.
This is just the tip of the iceberg of failed Democrat leadership – and it’s only going to get worse if Brindisi, Biden, and Pelosi win on November 3rd and take over Washington.
That’s why I need to know where you stand.
Friend, the rising crime that we’re seeing across the country right now could have all been avoided – but Democrats chose to sit on the sidelines and do nothing to stop it.
America can’t prosper without a strong rule of law and strong police departments to keep us safe, and that’s why I’m running to strengthen law & order starting right here in NY-22.
With just 77 days to go until we cast our votes, I need to know that you’re with me on this issue.
What will you choose on November 3rd?

84,"Watching the Democratic National Convention has given me hope. It has reminded me that we can dream of a world, a nation, that is brought together by leadership.
Hi Alex,
If you’re like me, this summer has had its ups and downs. Judging by the posts on social media, many of you feel like you’ve had your fair share of difficulties: a pandemic, rising unemployment, increased crime, outrage over the deaths of George Floyd and Breona Taylor, and so many more. And now, fires - not just one, but four - raging through our state. I saw someone’s post the other day: “Can’t we just say that 2020 is another four letter word… like what the 2020 are you talking about; shut the 2020 up…” I get it.
But watching the Democratic National Convention has given me hope. It has reminded me that we can dream of a world, a nation, that is brought together by leadership. Presidential nominee Joe Biden challenged us to see this moment for what it is: “a moment that calls for hope and light and love. Hope for our futures, light to see our way forward, and love for one another.""
So let’s pick up where we left off. Let’s do something positive for our neighbors and our community. I find with so much change, it’s only possible to set short-term goals. So here are a few of mine:
1. Register 10 people by the end of the month who were not already registered.
2. Choose 5 businesses affected by the recent forest fires and make a small donation.
3. Find an afternoon to spend with my wife and kiddos, disconnected from our phones, the news, and focused on each other.
4. Teach my son to ride a bike without training wheels.
5. Take the kids fishing.
What are your goals? How are you finding time to stay balanced? We have to be there to support each other. And with that, I leave you with the much more inspiring words of Senator Kamala Harris:
""Years from now, when this moment has passed, our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and ask us: ‘Where were you when the stakes were so high?’ And we will tell them, not just how we felt—we will tell them what we did.""
I hope to tell my kids that I fought hard to represent House District 2, that I did my part to mobilize voters in the most historic election of my life so far, and that I brought back a bit of love to our lives and our community.
All the best,

#  Real Justice
Add your name to our petition: Demand that Governor Cuomo remove all cash bail demands from his budget during a public health crisis.
Alex,
A few weeks ago we told you about Angel Garcia, a New Yorker who spent 15 days in jail at Rikers Island because his family could not afford his $20,000 bail. His crime was stealing bikes to put food on the table for his family.
Angel’s story is like that of so many New Yorkers who are desperate to raise themselves and their families out of poverty. And now, in the midst of a public health crisis, Governor Andrew Cuomo wants to roll back bail reform measures recently passed in New York to start jailing more people again.
We cannot stand by as the Governor attempts to criminalize poverty during a pandemic. Tell Governor Cuomo to remove all cash bail demands from his budget.
Take Action
If Angel were in jail right now, he would be forced into close quarters with hundreds of other inmates who have the potential to carry and spread the COVID-19 virus. Currently, 84 people have tested positive for COVID-19 at Rikers.
As the CDC and other world health organizations tell us we need to social distance, Andrew Cuomo is trying to punish poor people by forcing them into confined jail cells.
Sign our petition demanding that Governor Cuomo ensure the safety and well-being of all New Yorkers and stop jailing people for non-violent and misdemeanor offenses.
During this time of crisis, our government leaders should not be trying to take advantage of the poor.
Sign the petition
Thank you for taking action.

Madeleine Dean for Congress
Dear Friend,
Reform and action are necessary from our leaders at every level, and with our collective mourning must come swift action.
That’s why I am standing with Representative Jeffries to support the Eric Garner Effective Use of Force Prevention Act—a bill that bans chokeholds and pressure to the neck by police.
And just this week, I joined my colleagues as an original cosponsor to The Justice in Policing Act of 2020, which will:
* Hold police accountable in our courts
* Improve transparency into policing by collecting better and more accurate data of police misconduct
* Improve police training and practices
* Make lynching a federal crime
Yes, this is long overdue—and it continues to not be enough—but we must take the immediate steps we can with the promise of continued action.
Stand with me by adding your name.
History will repeat itself unless we make a change
Something I cannot get past: If these bills had been passed, we could have immediately held the police responsible accountable for the death of George Floyd.
And for 5 years we have not learned from the death of Eric Garner. But for so much longer we have not listened to Black Americans when they have demanded change.
No longer.
In solidarity,
Madeleine Dean

Today is Juneteenth. President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation to declare an end to the vile institution of slavery in America in 1862. But, many enslaved people were still held captive even after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed.
On June 19, 1865, the word of freedom finally reached a community of enslaved people in Galveston, Texas. It was on that day that Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, arrived in Galveston to declare freedom for the people who were still enslaved. It had taken nearly two and a half years for this news to travel to the hundreds of thousands of enslaved people still remaining in Texas.
The celebration of rejoice and reunion that followed is one we continue to this day.
On this Juneteenth, I am taking time to remember our history, to rejoice in the progress we have made and reflect on the enormity of the work we have left to do.
The truth is that even once Black Americans were emancipated, our ancestors continued to face enormous barriers: to live free from racism and racialized violence, to work with dignity, to vote, to build wealth and economic security for themselves and for future generations.
Today, as those barriers remain, so must our commitment to justice.
That is why I am working to push Congress to act to take the transformative steps needed to address the hate and systemic racism that is still so deeply rooted in our laws and institutions. We must finally make lynching a federal crime, reform our criminal justice system, and critically, intervene to create more transparent and accountable police departments.
The injustices we must confront are interrelated: from environmental injustice that disproportionately affects Black Americans to disparities in health access and outcomes to the staggering racial wealth gap that disadvantages Black families. We have so much work to do.
Today, as I honor the sacrifices made by my ancestors and rejoice in their grace and relentless hope for this country, I renew my commitment to fighting for true justice and equality for all.
I hope you will join me.

One of the hardest things for me to watch has been the apathetic response to the decline of New York. This used to be one of the cleanest, safest, big cities in the world, but voters ""have become"", as the song goes, ""comfortably numb.""
Help Us Finish the Quarter Strong
But it’s not too late. We are ending the quarter and have 5 weeks until the election. Help us meet our financial goals. Radical representatives like my opponent Adriano Espaillat are counting on you to not show up, or support my campaign. Like other Democrats, Espaillat is on board for the woke agenda. He brags about being the first undocumented immigrant in Congress, if that tells you anything.
This is the epitome of leftwing hubris. The modern Democratic Party has contempt for you and the country. Shove it back in their smug faces and support my campaign.
Sincerely,
Lovelynn Gwinn
Republican Nominee for Congress NY-13
P.S. I'm Lovelynn Gwinn, and I want to be your representative, not your politician.

Friend,
I am used to getting attacked by the mainstream media and the Left. But this is something new.
I've been running ads in swing states to make sure voters know that a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for chaos, crime, and open borders. Joe Biden has turned his campaign platform over to Bernie Sanders and Joe would rather hide out in his basement than face the voters.
And my work is getting noticed.
A group of former ""Never Trump"" consultants have started running attack ads against me because I've had the audacity to point out that Joe Biden is too confused to lead. Why are they coming after me? Because they know that my attacks against Joe Biden can help President Trump win four more years.
Friend, let's be real. A lot of Republicans would see these attacks from the Never Trumpers and back down. After all, it's easier to just be quiet and not fight back.
But I've decided to stand up to the mob. And I want you to join me. Want to make the “Never Trump” activists mad?
Help me run more attack ads against Joe Biden.
I've launched the “Stand For Freedom” fund where we can fight back. Your contribution to this fund will help me run more ads to tell voters the truth about Joe Biden. I've set a goal to raise $50,000 today to launch more ads exposing Joe Biden for being soft on China and unable to stand up to the liberal mob.
Will you help me tell voters the truth about Joe Biden?

PLEASE BE HONEST. OFFICIAL POLL CONDUCTED 09/20/2020, COLLECTING RESPONSES UNTIL 11:59PM.
Trump escaped impeachment simply because the GOP saved his hide.
But in the impeachment trial, we saw hard evidence that Trump obstructed justice.
So Kamala Harris, speaking as a former prosecutor, is simply trying to uphold the law. Trump is not above the law and he must be held accountable.
But charging an ex-President (even one as CORRUPT and CRIMINAL as Trump) is controversial, so we need to gauge support among informed Democrats.
The Department of Justice will NEVER act unless we show public support, so we need your response immediately >>

Dear Patriot,
Our Country is at a crossroads right now…
As the Coronavirus spreads from country to country and has even spread in pockets to our shores, we are reminded of how vitally important our borders are… and how insecure they are currently.
Our nation is being invaded by illegal aliens, pouring across our unsecure Southern border. Thousands of drug smugglers and human traffickers hide amongst them, bringing in violent crime.
In the wake of a pandemic, we need action NOW!
Please donate to my campaign and send a true conservative to Washington who will stand with the President and Build the Wall!
As a Homeland Security Policy Strategist, my job is to help keep our country safe. Every day, I have to deal with the consequences of an unsecure border, from a coronavirus outbreak to a gang shooting in our neighborhoods.
Waves of people pouring across our border in caravans, unvetted and illegally, is a huge national security risk! And Democrats like Jennifer Wexton will not do anything. In fact, they WANT open borders. Socialists like George Soros are even funding some of the caravans.
Why? Because they hope one day to grant illegal aliens total amnesty and create a new wave of democrat voters. And they don’t care how many Americans get hurt in the process.
These open-borders, pro-illegal Democrats like Wexton even go as far as to attack our existing border security infrastructure. Democrats have even said they want to abolish ICE! I need your help to stop them!
Its time to stand with the President, Build the Wall, and secure our Southern Border once and for all!
Please donate $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, $500, or more to my campaign today and help me fight with the President!
The Illegal-First agenda needs to be stopped now! Our Country is so vulnerable to global pandemics like Coronavirus and smuggling without a secure border.
The Wall is just the start…
If elected, I will get border security and ICE the tools it needs to verify very single person who tries to step foot on American soil.
Socialist, illegal-first Democrats like Jennifer Wexton need to be sent packing and replaced by Conservatives who will stand with our President!
Please donate your most generous gift today and we can take back this District!

Thanks for your support!
Team Ossoff
\-------- Begin Forwarded Message ---------
From: Tim Kaine
Date: August 17, 2020
Subject: Join me in supporting Jon Ossoff for Senate
Friend,
On November 3, we are going to close the door on Donald Trump's presidency. Then, we can expand our potential to make real progress on the issues that make a difference in people's lives.
But to achieve that potential, we need my friend Jon Ossoff in the United States Senate. Here's why:
It's time to elect a new generation of leaders. And Jon Ossoff's achievements as an investigative journalist -- leading a team that's exposed war crimes, enslavement, murder, and bribery all over the planet -- speak to his courage, his values, and his toughness.
Jon and his supporters have made this one of the country's most competitive races during a time when dozens of states are coming into play. So today I'm asking you to dig deep and invest in Jon's victory. Will you donate right now to help Jon Ossoff win in Georgia and flip the Senate?

Senate Republicans have used the past four years to give tax breaks to the wealthy, scheme how to take health care away from millions, and confirm scores of unqualified or extreme judicial and executive nominees.
The solution to removing the GOP stranglehold on the Senate lies in no small part with Jon Ossoff in Georgia. Jon is surging in the polls as more and more voters learn about his history fighting corruption.
But here's what's even more important: Jon is someone Georgians can rely on. He is focused on ensuring every American has affordable health care and rebuilding the economy so working families and small businesses thrive, and he's committed to passing a new Voting Rights Act and a new Civil Rights Act.
When I look at Georgia, I see what Virginia looked like just a few years ago. Democrats are making huge inroads, and if we can all do our part to invest and help good, smart leaders like Jon reach the finish line, we can flip Georgia.
Jon is neck-and-neck in the polls with his pro-Trump opponent who has repeatedly voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But the GOP knows control of the Senate comes down to Georgia, so they are spending big to keep their power. Mitch McConnell's allies and super PACs have already committed over $25 million to stop Jon.
Jon isn't taking contributions from corporate PACs or federal lobbyists. That means he's relying on a small-dollar grassroots campaign to power him to victory.
We can't flip the Senate without you, friend. Can you chip in $15 to elect Jon Ossoff in Georgia and help chart a new course for this country?

The GOP is trying to make it more difficult for citizens to vote all across America -- and nowhere more than in Georgia. They've led efforts to purge hundreds of thousands of Georgians from voter rolls over the last few years.
They want you to wait in long lines. They want your polling place to be far away. They want you to be so dispirited and inconvenienced, you don't bother voting.
But Alex, in spite of this historic voter suppression, something special is happening in Georgia.
Over 1.3 million Georgia voters have requested mail ballots -- nearly a quarter of whom didn't vote four years ago. Tens of thousands of Georgians have already voted. Just days ago, a state court rejected a GOP effort to purge 14,000 voters from voter rolls in Fulton County.

Alex,
It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
For the sake of American strength, jobs, law and order, our lives, and our liberties, we must defeat this radical duo on Election Day. The stakes have never been higher, Alex, and we need your help to send a message that this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS.
For the NEXT HOUR, all contributions will be 600%-MATCHED!

Electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November would be a grave mistake for this Nation with irreversible consequences. They will raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators.
