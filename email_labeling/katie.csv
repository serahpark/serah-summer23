Alex,
Republicans in the Senate just voted to acquit Donald Trump, sealing the coverup of the extortion plot against Ukraine.
Blue Future is focusing on youth organizing to elect Democrats who respect the rule of law and our democracy up and down the ballot. Let’s throw the whole corrupt Republican Party out of power this November and send a message that this corruption will not stand.
We’re going to work every day, and I mean every single day, from now until November, to flip the Senate, and defeat the Senators who are up for re-election this year and voted to acquit Donald Trump.
SHAME:
Dan Sullivan (AK)
Martha McSally (AZ)
Tom Cotton (AR)
Cory Gardner (CO)
David Perdue (GA)
Kelly Loeffler (GA)
Jim Risch (ID)
Joni Ernst (IA)
Mitch McConnell (KY)
Bill Cassidy (LA)
Susan Collins (ME)
Cindy Hyde-Smith (MS)
Steve Daines (MT)
Ben Sasse (NE)
Thom Tillis (NC)
Jim Inhofe (OK)
Lindsey Graham (SC)
Mike Rounds (SD)
John Cornyn (TX)
Shelley Moore Capito (WV)
While many of them decried the “partisan” nature of impeachment, in the end, only the coverup was partisan. One Republican, Mitt Romney, joined every Democrat to remove Trump from office, while the rest of the Republicans voted to give Trump license to commit any crime he’d like to ensure his re-election.
We’re going to mobilize the 7 million newly eligible voters who have turned 18 since the 2016 election. And we’re going to ensure that turnout this November is #TooBigToRig. Stand with us today!
You rock,
Nick Guthman

POLICY SPOTLIGHT:
FIGHTING FOR VOTING RIGHTS
I have worked hard as a legislator to protect the voting rights of all Texans, and especially for communities of color, through pushing for fair representation during redistricting, opposing discriminatory Voter ID laws, and fighting for the spirit of the Voting Rights Act. If re-elected, I will continue to fight for people’s right to vote.
Redistricting
In 2021, the Texas Legislature will take up redistricting again. Redistricting is very important because Texas has a history of illegally gerrymandering districts to suppress the voting power of communities of color.
In the 2011 redistricting cycle, I offered a redistricting amendment to substantially increase the number of majority minority Texas House districts. I testified for the Department of Justice during the Obama Presidency in Washington D.C. arguing that the Texas House District maps from 2011 were drawn to suppress the voting rights of people of color.
Voter ID Laws
I have always opposed and voted against Texas' discriminatory Voter ID laws. As a reminder, Voter ID laws address a problem that doesn’t actually exist. In order to commit the kind of voter fraud “solved” by Voter ID laws, you would have to know the name of someone registered to vote and cast your ballot for them. Voter fraud is a federal crime. Who would risk going to jail to cast a fraudulent vote? That being said, you won’t be surprised to learn that there are extremely few cases of this occurring.

Celebrating 55 Years of the Voting Rights Act (VRA)
This summer we celebrate the 56th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This landmark legislation may be one of the most impactful pieces of legislation in American History. Without it, the number of people of color in both federal and state legislatures would be much more woefully low. I would not be proudly representing District 147 without the VRA. Even President Obama said, ""I might not be . . . President had it not been for those who courageously helped to pass the Voting Rights Act.”
The VRA took a big hit in 2013 when the Supreme Court regrettably decided to essentially remove the pre-clearance portion of the VRA in Shelby County v. Holder. ""Pre-clearance"" was the process in place that used to require the Justice Department to “pre-clear” election laws passed by certain historically discriminatory states like Texas before those laws could take effect. If pre-clearance had still been on the books after 2013, we would not have had to go through a federal election cycles with discriminatory maps or Voter ID laws in place, because they would never have been approved by the Justice Department. Hopefully the inevitable increase in election laws being found to violate the VRA will restore the will of Congress to re-enact the still-useful pre-clearance requirement.

52,"Corruption is ruining our Democracy
Corruption is ruining our democracy.
Breaking: Cook Political Report Shifts Georgia Senate Race Toward Democrats
Corrupt politicians and their corporate donors use the federal government to enrich themselves — while obstructing popular policies like a New Civil Rights Act, affordable health care for every American, and ambitious investments in infrastructure and clean energy!
It's time for a new generation of leadership to clean up this mess.
That's why Democrat Jon Ossoff is running for U.S. Senate to launch an all-out attack on political corruption.
And Jon's opponent, GOP Senator David Perdue, is as crooked as they come:
* He got caught selling meetings for corporate campaign cash and taking illegal corporate campaign contributions.
* He bought stock in a company that produces medical PPE the same day the Senate received a classified briefing on COVID-19, then dumped casino shares to buy vaccine stock while the pandemic bore down on America.
* He took campaign cash from the pharmaceutical industry and then voted against importing cheaper prescription drugs from Canada.
* He traded his stocks 300% more than usual while writing the largest emergency spending bill in American history!
And in the most recent polling Jon Ossoff is beating crooked Perdue by 2%!!
Over the past few months, the people of Georgia have seen Senator Perdue for what he is — a mindless Trump sycophant with no beliefs of his own, a corporate sellout, and a self-dealing influence peddler — the poster boy of Washington corruption.
Jon Ossoff has spent his career exposing corruption and the abuse of power — holding people like David Perdue accountable.
REMEMBER: Jon Ossoff runs a business renowned for its hard-hitting investigations of corruption, organized crime, and war crimes around the world!
Now Jon is running for the U.S. Senate to expose and defeat one of the most corrupt Senators in American history, and he's already leading in the polls.
This is the beginning of a new chapter in our country's history and the beginning of the end for corrupt politicians like David Perdue.
Express Donate $5
Defeating a corrupt Senator like David Perdue and his political machine will require a huge grassroots campaign.
And we're going to need help building it!!

54,"On Joe Biden’s VP pick
Trump Pence Make America Great Again
Friend,
It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
For the sake of American strength, jobs, law and order, our lives, and our liberties, we must defeat this radical duo on Election Day. The stakes have never been higher, and we need your help to send a message that this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS.
For the NEXT HOUR, all contributions will be 600%-MATCHED!
Please contribute ANY AMOUNT in the NEXT HOUR to FIGHT for President Trump and your gift will be 600%-MATCHED. >>
Fight for your Country! CONTRIBUTE $20 = $140
CONTRIBUTE $15 = $105
CONTRIBUTE $10 = $70
CONTRIBUTE $5 = $35
CONTRIBUTE ANY AMOUNT
Electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November would be a grave mistake for this Nation with irreversible consequences. They will raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators.
We cannot allow our Nation to go down that path.
President Trump and I are counting on our BEST supporters right now. Can we count on YOU to step up during this critical time?
Please contribute ANY AMOUNT IMMEDIATELY to help us WIN BIG in November and your gift will be instantly 600%-MATCHED.

News: Biden campaign becomes first major party presidential campaign in U.S. history to complete Hindu American issues questionnaire
For the first time, a major party presidential campaign has responded to a questionnaire posed by a Hindu American group. The Biden campaign responded to our questionnaire in its entirety. The Trump campaign deferred responding.
Full response here: [[URL REDACTED]]
Response highlights:
* Hindu students are bullied because Hinduism is misrepresented in the classroom (cites Hindu American Foundation survey) and because it is under-reported. Would recruit teachers from diverse backgrounds to teach sensitive subjects.
* Calls out hate crimes targeting Hindus.
* ""supports eliminating the limits on employment-based green cards by country, which have kept so many Indian and Hindu families in waiting too long.""
* Remove H1-B visa caps for those working in STEM fields.
* Support Hindu/Indian small business owners.
On Kashmir:
* Joe Biden will have ""no tolerance"" for terrorism in South Asia, ""cross-border or otherwise""
* Committed to work closely with India as a ""counter-terrorism partner"" & strengthen India's defense capabilities
Note: Hindu American PAC did not ask either campaign about #CAA, #Article370, or any issue internal to India - for which no U.S. administration has locus standi to comment. Hindu American PAC remains concerned that these issues were unfavorably mentioned in the campaign's Muslim American community agenda and continues to engage the Biden campaign about these issues.
The Hindu American PAC thanks the Joe Biden campaign for responding to its questionnaire in its entirety and for its engagement. If we hear from the Donald J. Trump campaign on the issues, any such communication will be shared, though the Sept. 10th deadline has elapsed. Since the Trump campaign did not respond to the questionnaire, we will refrain from offering an official endorsement for either campaign.
Please support our work with a donation \- we continue to research and endorse congressional and legislative candidates for the general election, and we will be announcing our general election endorsement list soon.
Thanks again for your support!

Donald Trump
At the RNC, Trump said he's ""done more in three years for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years.""
Let’s check the facts:
\-- He called African nations “sh*thole countries”
\-- He’s told Black Congresswomen to “go back to the crime-infested places of which they came”
\-- And he won’t do ANYTHING to stop police brutality.
So we need EVERY good Democrat to join our fight to END Trump’s racist attacks. We're $27,094 short of our goal to fuel this fight. Donate $5 to stop Trump’s racist attacks now >>
For decades, Black Americans have risked everything to fight for equality.
That fight is FAR from over.
Police are still taking innocent Black lives.
And Trump won’t do anything to help. He’ll just spew racist lies.
The President will not do the right thing unless will force him. We need $45,000 to fund our campaigns. Every dollar will go to electing Black Democrats who will stand up to Trump’s racism.
But if we miss this goal, Trump will continue to ignore us.
So please, don’t wait another minute. Rush $5 to end Trump’s racist and bigoted attacks on Black Americans >>

What’s going to happen if Trump doesn’t get reelected?
The mere thought is horrifying.
Corrupt liberals running the country...
Crime running rampant...
Our men and women in blue shamed and defunded.
Borders wide open...
Guns confiscated...
A tax burden so oppressive mainstream America will be homeless and without food to feed their families.
Health care costs will skyrocket...
The market will crash without hope for a recovery for years...
They’ll pack the Supreme Court and turn America into a socialist country.
Lady Liberty will cry and freedom and justice will be shackled.
I don’t know about you, but these liberals make me so angry I could spit fire.
Nothing but a bunch of lying, conniving, sneaky socialist pigs.
We simply can’t let them win but I’m going to be brutally honest because there’s no other way...
So here goes...
I’m petrified we’re starting to lose the battle...
You know Trump caught Covid-19. And when he did he got really behind in campaigning.
It’s not his fault, it’s not mine and it’s not yours.
But now...
It feels as if Trump’s reelection is slipping through our fingers.
And it has shaken me to the core.
We CAN’T let that happen.
You do want 4 more years of Trump, right?
If so, please sign our Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP.
President Trump needs to know how many Patriots he can count on.
Right now we’re finalizing the list of Patriots who already completed the Official 2020 Pledge to VOTE TRUMP on Election Day—and we need to know you’re with us.
Please check right now to make certain you’re on the list and not left out. IN fact...
There’s no time to lose because the Official 2020 Pledge to Vote Trump is going to every Republican in Congress tomorrow morning.
Don’t be left off or left out.
We have so little time and so much to do. If Trump doesn’t pull ahead with our help and he loses...
We all lose my friend: our democracy, freedom, jobs, homes, you name [[URL REDACTED]] can kiss it all goodbye.
We’ve got to fight harder, scream louder, round up every Trump supporter we know...
Every undecided sitting on the fence...
And RISE UP.
I’m worried sick. I can’t sleep at night.
Even Ted Cruz is running scared right now.
He came right out and said it...
“I'm worried about the election. I think it's really volatile. I think it could go either way. [[URL REDACTED]] president could win by a big margin and we could win both houses of Congress, [[URL REDACTED]] could be devastating.”
I really need you to sign the Official 2020 Vote Trump Pledge then I beg you...
Give a donation of whatever you can...
When you give by midnight, check right now your donation will get 5X THE IMPACT!
$35 DONATION = 5X THE IMPACT
$50 DONATION = 5X THE IMPACT
$75 DONATION = 5X THE IMPACT
$100 DONATION = 5X THE IMPACT
$250 DONATION = 5X THE IMPACT
$500 DONATION = 5X THE IMPACT
$1000 DONATION = 5X THE IMPACT
ANY AMOUNT = 5X THE IMPACT
Yep, I’ve opened up the 5X THE IMPACT campaign again because of our dire need to ramp up and roll out.
It’s lock and load time, my friend...
Time to pull out the big guns and all the stops.
Do you realize...
Your donation, no matter how big or small, could be the one the helps clinch the WIN for Trump?
The reality is...
We’re fighting a political propaganda machine with an endless stream of money funding it.
In fact, while no one was looking do you know what the Democrats did?
Secretly funneled $170 million in government grants to radical left-wing extremist groups to carry out their dirty work.
The group funding them—the Tides Center—has been flying under the radar for years...
Constantly creating new activist groups—that’s their sole mission.
These radical activist groups are the ones burning our country down.
If this doesn’t make you steamed, I don’t know what will because...
They’re using YOUR tax dollars!!!!
And they’re using them to fund radical extremist groups like Marxist Black Lives Matter Global Network...
Not to mention the Tides Center is an incubator for gun control and abortion rights.
They’re like this giant secretive dark money pit that Democrat donors throw massive amounts of money into.
Need I say more? This is as bad as I’ve ever seen it.
Not only are they using extremist groups now but...
IF Trump loses these radicals are going to overrun the country...
Is that what you want?
I sure as hell don’t.
Look my friend, the liberals and their “super snowflakes” have mega money to burn and...
They’re throwing it at the feet of any radical that will take up their cause: defeat Trump and turn America into a globalist cabal.
Senator Cruz said it best...
""There are a lot of Democrats trying to steal the election...” “The left is showing up. They're pissed off. They hate Trump. We've got to make sure everyone else shows up.”
We need you to show up NOW — not tomorrow or the next day or only on November 3 at the voting booth.
Time is running out fast.

Remember how they removed God from our monuments, schools and military already under Obama? That was just phase 1.
No doubt phase 2 will be the complete eradication of God.
Bibles will be [[URL REDACTED]] of worship will be taxed, putting them out of business...probably boarded up.
That cross around your neck? It’ll become a crime to wear it.

Now you may be thinking, “Yeah I saw the polls but the polls can’t be trusted.”

Your donation puts our army of Trump supporters on the phone...
...relentlessly blasting our messages across social media...
... churning out faxes and emails...
...putting boots on the ground in DC and across the country...
... organizing rallies, marches and boat parades...

It’s terrifying.

Alex, Trump continues to abuse his power to an extent never before seen in American history:
* He refused to divest from his business interests.
* He pardoned his friends and campaign staffers for crimes they committed in his name.
* He was impeached for abusing the power of the presidency.
* And all that was before his campaign violated federal law by using the White House as the backdrop for the Republican National Convention.
These are not minor issues, they’re serious offenses that demand immediate consequences. Over a third of Americans still stand by Trump and his overreach of executive power – but with only weeks until people begin casting their ballots, we need to know you’re not one of them.

Alex,
As a former Sheriff and law enforcement official for 22 years, I firmly believe that any solutions to reduce violent crime should punish the most dangerous criminals and thugs, not law-abiding gun owners.
As Governor, I’ll continue working closely with local, state, and federal officials to further develop a comprehensive and common-sense approach that cracks down on the most dangerous criminals, strengthens witness protection, and provides law enforcement officials with facilities to deal with mental health patients and get back to protecting their communities faster — doing all while ensuring the protection of law-abiding citizens Second Amendment rights.
I have championed some of the strongest pro-Second Amendment legislation in the country and I have always been proud to receive the NRA’s highest A+ rating and endorsement.

Great news! Teresa Hensley, the most recent Democratic nominee for Missouri Attorney General, has endorsed Rich Finneran in his bid to become Missouri’s next Attorney General.
Before she ran for Attorney General in 2016, Hensley spent a decade as Cass County’s top prosecutor, so she has the experience to know what qualities we need in our next Attorney General.
Here’s what she said about Rich in her endorsement:
“Rich possesses all the qualities Missourians should demand from their top law enforcement officer: experience prosecuting crimes, a passion for fair and equal justice, and a commitment to protecting the rights of all Missourians. He will be the independent watchdog we need in the Attorney General’s Office.”
Our campaign is proud to have the support of a prosecutor who deeply believes in fighting to administer justice fairly and equally and to protect the rights of all Missouri’s families.
Please join Teresa Hensley in supporting Rich’s campaign today by making a contribution of $25, $50, or whatever you can now.
We appreciate your support.

Breonna’s life was stolen. But the three police officers who invaded her home are STILL gainfully employed and have yet to be arrested and charged with murder.

RELEASE
Democrat House Vote on Amnesty Wednesday Designed to Rally Felon Voters
[[URL REDACTED]]
For National Release: December 9, 2019
""ALIPAC is warning candidates, campaigns, and incumbents in Congress that Wednesday's vote on AgJobs Amnesty bill HR 5038 will be a major issue in 2020 elections where large majorities of American oppose Amnesty, and that the real purpose of the bill is for the Democrats to rally their non-citizen voters who are committing felonies by registering and voting for Democrats in 2020.""-- William Gheen, [[URL REDACTED]]
Americans for Legal Immigration Political Action Committee ([[URL REDACTED]]) activists are rapidly contacting incumbent members of Congress and GOP campaigns for public office to warn that America's legal citizens overwhelmingly oppose the AgJobs Amnesty bill HR 5038, which the Democrats have scheduled for a vote this Wednesday where the purpose of the bill is to rally Democrat non-citizen voters who are committing felonies by registering and voting in 2020.
HR 5038 is titled the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2019 and will grant Amnesty, jobs, ID, and voting rights to millions of illegal immigrants currently in the US. ALIPAC warns that passage of HR 5038 will encourage more illegal aliens to enter the US and will encourage current illegals to commit more crimes by registering and voting for Democrats in 2020.
America currently has no significant safeguards in place to prevent non-citizens, including the more than twenty million illegal aliens in the US, from registering to vote and casting ballots for Democrats in 2020, although each action is a federal felony. ALIPAC is documenting the nationwide crisis of non-citizen voters in an online list for use by activists, lawmakers, candidates, and the media. (View List on documented cases of noncitizen voters HERE)
ALIPAC contends that each ballot cast by a non-citizen is a vote stolen from an American voter and is the highest form of civil rights violation as well as a violation of Article IV (section 4) of the US Constitution which requires the ""United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion...""
""Our message to lawmakers and candidates is that the vote on Amnesty bill HR 5038 will be a major issue in the 2020 campaigns where most Americans oppose Amnesty since the elections have the greatest power to stop this Amnesty,"" said William Gheen, of ALIPAC. ""The Democrats want to use this legislation to rally their non-citizen voters who are being registered through left-wing political operations, including the new twenty million dollar voter registration campaign in swing states like North Carolina and Wisconsin funded by open-borders Amnesty advocate and Presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg.""
Democrats just passed an overhaul of the Voting Rights Act last Friday to try to protect their illegal voters and illegal campaign operations registering non-citizen voters for 2020.
They are trying to stop states like North Carolina, where ALIPAC backed state legislation that would have prevented people who say they are non-citizens to avoid jury duty from registering to vote and casting ballots. Pro-Amnesty Democrat Governor Roy Cooper vetoed the bill to protect non-citizen and illegal alien voters in swing state North Carolina!
For more information on ALIPAC's efforts to defeat Amnesty legislation in DC for an 11th time since 2004 and to stop non-citizen voters from stealing US elections and turning all states as socialist blue as California, please visit [[URL REDACTED]] .

66,"Evergreen wildfire, return to school, CO mask order, federal overreach in Portland, and hate crime in Lakewood
Dear Alex,
As we enter the dog days of summer, several things have been weighing on my mind. Chiefly, I’ve heard from a number of educators about their concerns in returning to work. I share these concerns. Quite honestly, if I were the parent of a school age child, I’m not sure what I would do. And I’m deeply concerned about the safety of educators. Combined with the necessity of parents to return to work, there is no question that this is a deeply complex issue. While legislators have no direct authority to make decisions about return dates, remote learning, and in-person safety protocols, I will be having conversations and advocating for the safety of all to the best of my ability.
The other thing that has been troubling me is that Federal agents are descending upon Portland against the objections of state and local leaders, using extreme force and detaining protestors in unmarked vehicles. This is an overreach of the Federal government, and something that should concern all of us who believe in the right to protest and also states’ rights, which were embedded in the constitution by our forefathers as a safeguard against excessive centralized power. We are watching this issue closely, and I signed onto a letter to US Attorney Jason Dunn urging him to take action to protect Colorado from such overreach.
These are interesting times. I believe we can get through them together through dialogue, compromise, creative problem solving and a lot of grace.
Click the picture above for a video from the Evergreen Chamber of Commerce where I and many others thank our brave first responders who kept the people of Evergreen safe and contained the fire!
Elephant Butte Wildfire: On July 13, the Elephant Butte wildfire was spotted in our district. It was contained, thanks to the hard work of our firefighters, and the final area it covered was around 50 acres. Ultimately, around 1,000 homes were evacuated on Monday, and though residents are now allowed back in the area, safety restrictions are still in place in a number of areas and parks. Given the location of our district, wildfires are a frequent problem, which is why I am proud to be in a position to push for stronger protective measures against wildfires and greater assistance for those who are affected by these disasters. Indeed, just this year I sponsored a bill that increases the benefits provided to firefighters like those who contained the Elephant Butte fire. I also put forward two bills that had to be cancelled due to the outbreak of COVID-19: HB20-1142, which would have created a fund to finance a grant program for wildfire mitigation projects by local governments, and HB20-1004, which would have created a grant program to provide resources to landowners for wildfire mitigation. Wildfire response and mitigation is incredibly important to our community, and I will definitely be working to address these issues next session.
Focus on Local Businesses: Our local businesses make up the backbone of our community, and I enjoy working closely with both the Conifer Chamber of Commerce and the Evergreen Chamber of Commerce—both led by strong and capable women (Melanie Swearengin and Betsy Hayes). Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, I’ve tried to work as closely as possible with these two terrific organizations to address the needs of our business community. As the impacts of the pandemic continue to strain our small businesses, I am always available to hear their concerns and to do what I can to help these businesses survive and thrive.
As a legislator, I see my job as protecting and supporting the people of Colorado. As of 2015, 48.6% of Coloradans--just over one million people--were employed by businesses with less than 100 employees. These businesses are the lifeblood of our community, and they are in danger because they are not receiving the same support from the federal government as larger, better resourced and represented corporations. That is why I am doing all that I can to protect and support small businesses in our community at the state level. One of the ways I have done this is through two bills that I have mentioned before. HB20-1413, the CLIMBER Act, establishes a $250 million public-private fund to give below market rate loans to small businesses. Similarly, SB20-222 establishes a $20 million fund using CARES money to give grants to small businesses. Together, these bills provide much-needed support for our small businesses when they need it most.
I’ll be providing information and answering questions around small business legislation next Friday, July 31 with the Conifer Chamber. Check their Facebook page or their event registration page for information on how to join the event if you’re interested in learning more.
Mask Order: As of July 16 at midnight, all people in Colorado who are 11 years or older must wear a covering over their noses and mouths when entering or moving within any public indoor space and while using or waiting to use transportation services (buses, light rail, taxis, and ride-shares). This order is in effect for 30 days, but may be extended.
Here are responses to some common questions and concerns with this order:
* Do I have to wear a mask outdoors? Not unless waiting for non-personal transportation, but it is recommended that you wear a mask whenever you cannot maintain at least 6 feet of distance from other people.
* Does this apply to _____ store? To restaurants? To houses of worship? Yes to all. Masks are required in restaurants except when you are seated at a table. Individuals officiating a religious service are not required to wear masks, but are encouraged to do so if feasible.
* Are rules more or less restrictive in my county or city? Counties and Municipalities may have authority to issue more or less restrictive rules under certain conditions. To check your local rules, look to your local public health agency.
* What will happen if I refuse to wear a mask? You will be in violation of Colorado law and are subject to civil or criminal penalties.
* What are the rules for businesses? Indoor businesses must refuse service to people who are not wearing masks and post signs at entrances instructing customers that they must wear masks. If a business does not comply with the mask order, it is at risk of losing its license.
* Can I get carbon dioxide poisoning or lowered oxygen levels from wearing a mask? According to the Mayo Clinic Health System “for many years, health care providers have worn masks for extended periods of time with no adverse health reactions ... there is no risk of hypoxia, which is lower oxygen levels, in healthy adults. Carbon dioxide will freely diffuse through your mask as you breathe.”
* What is the most recent science behind this order? Masks help those infected from spreading COVID-19 through the partial filtering of infectious particles. Meta-analysis suggests that mask use may reduce infection rates by as much as 65%. For more information on the benefits of universal mask-wearing, please look to: this editorial from the CDC, the CDC’s website, and CDPHE’s website.
Hate Crime in Lakewood: In late April, Lakhwant Singh was brutally attacked outside of the store that he co-owns. I condemn this attack, and sent a letter--signed by most of my Jefferson County legislative colleagues--to District Attorney Pete Weir expressing our full support for his office’s thorough investigation of this attack as a hate crime. Hate does not belong in our community, and I am grateful to be in a position to advocate for justice.
Senator Brittany Pettersen set up a gofundme to help pay for Mr. Singh’s medical bills from the attack. If you are able to contribute to help him and his family in their time of need, please consider doing so.
Take care, and be well!

67,"Donald Trump just said he's ""done more for Black Americans than any other President.""
Donald Trump
At the RNC, Trump said he's ""done more in three years for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years.""
Let’s check the facts:
\-- He called African nations “sh*thole countries”
\-- He’s told Black Congresswomen to “go back to the crime-infested places of which they came”
\-- And he won’t do ANYTHING to stop police brutality.
So we need EVERY good Democrat to join our fight to END Trump’s racist attacks. We're $27,094 short of our goal to fuel this fight. Donate $5 to stop Trump’s racist attacks now >>
For decades, Black Americans have risked everything to fight for equality.
That fight is FAR from over.
Police are still taking innocent Black lives.
And Trump won’t do anything to help. He’ll just spew racist lies.
The President will not do the right thing unless will force him. We need $45,000 to fund our campaigns. Every dollar will go to electing Black Democrats who will stand up to Trump’s racism.
But if we miss this goal, Trump will continue to ignore us.
So please, don’t wait another minute. Rush $5 to end Trump’s racist and bigoted attacks on Black Americans >>

DemocratsJoin us.
I'm the Democratic nominee for one of the two U.S. Senate seats in Georgia -- and we just learned Mitch McConnell’s super PAC is spending more money against me than any other Democratic Senate candidate in America.
This Senate race in Georgia is as close as it gets.
Remember, Stacey Abrams was only defeated here in 2018 by 1.4% -- running against the man who oversaw the election.
McConnell is spending tens of millions of dollars against me because I’m running to reform the corrupt system upon which he’s built his political machine -- a campaign finance system that lets insurance and drug companies, polluters, and ultra-rich political donors write the rules and exploit ordinary people.
My opponent, David Perdue, is the embodiment of that corruption. This man was busy trading medical and vaccine stocks in January and February while he assured us COVID-19 posed low risk to our health. He literally sells meetings at his home for a $7,500 check to the PAC that supports him.
We are exposing my opponent’s flagrant corruption. His campaign is sinking.
That’s why McConnell’s super PAC is spending more against me than any other Democratic U.S. Senate candidate. In Georgia.
To win in this state and overcome notorious voter suppression, we need the strongest technology, data, organizing, and voter protection infrastructure in the country. That means we need a strong effort to support me and the DNC here.
So, with this race neck and neck and so much on the line, will you split a $10 contribution between my campaign and the DNC today so we can mobilize and protect voters in Georgia and in other key states?

I’m an investigative journalist. I run a company that’s exposed corruption, organized crime, war crimes, and human rights abuses worldwide. I will bring that same passion for fighting corruption to Washington, to reform a system broken by corporate PACs, the lobbyist revolving door, and Citizens United.
Americans deserve clean government. And without reform -- as long as corporate PACs and lobbyists call the shots -- we won’t be able to ensure access to great health care, fight climate change and invest in clean energy, or protect Americans from price gouging by drug companies.
But to overcome voter suppression in Georgia, we need a strong Democratic effort from top to bottom.
That’s why I’m asking: Will you split a $10 donation between my campaign for U.S. Senate and the DNC today so we can win this crucial Senate race and seats across the country?
Thank you,

My name is Esti and I’m about to tell you my story. It touches on something very important to all of us, our identity, and how Donald Trump and the people he put in charge of the military tried to take that away from me.
When you're done reading, I hope you’ll sign our petition demanding an end to Donald Trump’s trans ban so that trans members of the military can finally be given the respect and human dignity they deserve.
Imagine constantly living in fear of being outed for your true gender identity and losing your job for living your truth. Maybe that job is supporting your entire family, maybe it’s helping you pay for school, maybe you’ve been working there for years without an issue, or maybe it’s your dream job you worked so hard to get.
Today, the Supreme Court changed that for so many people after making a monumental decision to finally extend workplace protections to the LGBTQ+ under the Civil Rights Act.
While this is a giant step forward for our community, I can’t help but think about the transgender men and women in the military who continue to be told they are unfit to serve solely because of their gender identity — including myself.
As a gender non-conforming individual formerly in the Army, I was a part of the population banned from serving due to Donald Trump’s “trans ban.” This extremely cruel, unjust order forces brave soldiers, willing to lay their life down for their country, to serve in silence, living a lie about who they were.
This cruelty didn’t start when I was banned from serving. The bigotry of intolerance against LGBTQ+ people was rooted deep within the military long before the ban. I was spat on in uniform when I returned home from a tour in Afghanistan for having Transgender and Pride flags on my backpack. I have been yelled at while in uniform to get out of a bathroom, even pulled out by the arm because that person didn’t think I belonged there, even while correctly following the state of North Carolina’s deplorable bathroom bill. And time and time again, people refuse to use my correct pronouns. These stories aren’t unique.
The stereotype of the military is dominated by a culture that centers straight white men, perpetuates the notion that others are not welcome, and contributes to hate against the LGBTQ+ community — whether they are in uniform or not. It’s forced myself and many others to remain afraid to come out, told day after day to reject and hide who they are.
I’m sharing my story, the story of so many of those still in the military facing discrimination every day, to show how serious this issue still is. Transgender soldiers have been serving for decades, and now is our moment to have our voices heard. We have the support, the passion, the drive, and the tools to be able to affect real change.
This is the time to fight for every member of the military forced to live a lie to keep their uniform.
We need you to stand with us, because the time is NOW. Make your voice heard by signing our petition demanding an end to Donald Trump’s trans ban so that trans members of the military can finally be given the respect and human dignity they deserve.
The discrimination, the brutal murders, and the hate crimes against the transgender community won’t end until we finally come together and say enough is enough. We must work together to change the dominant culture of the military that brews this injustice.
Continue to fight for the transgender soldiers still serving and the transgender veterans, like me, who are struggling to pay for transitioning surgery due to healthcare that won't cover it.
We need you. Take just a minute to stand up for this passionate, accepting community willing to by signing our petition to demand the end of Donald Trump’s trans ban.

71,"Mocking transgender Washingtonians is wrong.
I am proud that I was the first Attorney General to challenge President Trump’s transgender military ban.
Today we are in court, with our coalition partners, facing off against President Trump’s Department of Justice. We are fighting for the records that will reveal the Trump Administration’s true motives for the president’s discriminatory policy that prohibits Washingtonians from serving their country because of who they are.
Our values make our state and our country strong.
So let’s talk about Dori Monson, a local, conservative talk radio host.
Last week, Monson sent the following tweet.
“Inslee: we follow science in WA. The state where I could go to Olympia tomorrow and change my birth cert to say I was a girl on 10/2/61 HAHAHAHAHA.”
Let’s be clear — Monson is denying the scientific medical consensus that supports allowing transgender individuals to self-identify. He is openly mocking gender identity.
Transgender individuals are already disproportionately subject to depression, suicide, and hate crimes. Monson’s demeaning remarks contribute to the problem.
The people of Washington deserve better. Join me in sending a message to his employer that these transphobic comments are unacceptable.
Thank you,
Bob

72,"Friend:
This past Monday, a horrible fire devasted our unhoused residents at the Belmont and Kedzie underpass. Although no one was seriously injured or hurt, many of our residents lost all of their belongings. As the media began to publish reports and word of the fire began to spread, so many of you reached out to my office to step up and help out our vulnerable neighbors.
I want to give a special thanks to Avondale Mutual Aid for helping to organize support for the residents at the underpass and for their continued efforts to assist all of our community members in Avondale. Avondale Mutual Aid is a volunteer-driven community group that has been providing assistance to all residents in need since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. I encourage you to learn more about Avondale Mutual Aid and consider joining or donating to their efforts by visiting their Facebook: Avondale Mutual Aid. I also want to thank retired Chicago Police Sergeant Lee Bielecki and the police and fire families of Mount Greenwood, who heard about the fire and delivered a cargo van full of donations for the residents of the Belmont and Kedzie underpass Thursday evening. Lastly, I want to thank the many residents who dropped off items at the underpass and our office throughout the week. We are truly grateful for these kind acts of generosity and for the continued support for our unhoused residents.
It goes without saying that access to affordable and stable housing is key in the fight to end homelessness and to avoid tragic incidents like Monday's fire. I remain committed to supporting dedicated revenue to build housing for our unhoused neighbors. My office will continue to work with the Chicago Fire Department, Department of Family and Support Services, Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, encampment residents, and neighbors to keep our community safe.
In solidarity,

### Ash Tree Preservation Initiative
Learn about how you can be a part of helping save our Northwest Side Ash trees canopy which is at risk of dying. The North River Commission has created an initiative to preserve our city’s Ash trees which are under constant threat from a deadly pest, the Emerald Ash Borer. However, there is an affordable and effective treatment that provides up to four years of protection against infection. In 2019, after years of effectively and safely treating Ash trees, the city cut funding for the Bureau of Forestry treatment program. NRC’s treatment is effective, safe, and costs about $120 to treat a mature tree with 4 years of protection. More info here: [[URL REDACTED]]

73,"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
Trump Pence Make America Great Again
Friend,
It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.
I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
For the sake of American strength, jobs, law and order, our lives, and our liberties, we must defeat this radical duo on Election Day. The stakes have never been higher, and we need your help to send a message that this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS.
For the NEXT HOUR, all contributions will be 600%-MATCHED!
Please contribute ANY AMOUNT in the NEXT HOUR to FIGHT for President Trump and your gift will be 600%-MATCHED. >>
Fight for your Country! CONTRIBUTE $20 = $140
CONTRIBUTE $15 = $105
CONTRIBUTE $10 = $70
CONTRIBUTE $5 = $35
CONTRIBUTE ANY AMOUNT
Electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November would be a grave mistake for this Nation with irreversible consequences. They will raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators.
We cannot allow our Nation to go down that path.
President Trump and I are counting on our BEST supporters right now. Can we count on YOU to step up during this critical time?
Please contribute ANY AMOUNT IMMEDIATELY to help us WIN BIG in November and your gift will be instantly 600%-MATCHED.
Thank you,

P.S. I want you to know that no matter what the Left throws at us, we are not going anywhere. President Trump and I will fight for you every single day. As long as we have YOU on our team, we will WIN on November 3rd. Contribute NOW. >>

Fellow Conservative,
Our FINAL Mid-Month Deadline is 3 days away, and we need it to be BIG.
Critical funds for battleground races are SEVERELY LOW and if we don’t absolutely CRUSH this deadline, Trump and his allies COULD LOSE.

You know the ENORMOUS stakes of this election— and that it’s going to take every Trump patriot in America stepping up NOW if we want to save our country.
Fellow Conservative, it has never been more important to secure President Donald J. Trump a huge victory.
If we FAIL to CRUSH our FINAL MID-MONTH DEADLINE, that might not just cost us the election, it could cost us our DEMOCRACY.
Stand With Trump
We have never been closer to living in a socialist America. You see it everywhere you look. Democrats aren’t even trying to hide it anymore.
The Democrats even told us what they’re going to do:
⚠️ Defund the police.
⚠️ Raise Taxes by TRILLIONS, ruining our economic recovery and destroying 401k’s and retirement.
⚠️ Extend lockdowns indefinitely.
⚠️ Cripple private health insurance in favor of government-run health care.
⚠️ Pack the Supreme Court
If we don’t act NOW to support our President and restore Trump’s majority, the left will continue forcing their failed agenda on the lives of all AMERICANS.
Do you want to continue to live in a country where our Congress is run by a left-wing mob who denies their failed policies, evades questions that matter to Americans, and ignores the anarchy and chaos that has led to crime spikes like we’ve never seen?
If you don’t —GOOD. Do something about it.
We need all hands on deck if we want to stage the biggest upset in American history.
We need YOU, Fellow Conservative.
Make no mistake, we are the underdog going into this election, but with your help, we can pull off another HISTORIC victory.
Stand With Trump
Make an investment in your family’s future. A donation of $5, $10, $35, $100, or even $500 or more could make all the difference. Everything you give will go 600% as far.

Trump escaped impeachment simply because the GOP saved his hide.
But in the impeachment trial, we saw hard evidence that Trump obstructed justice.
So Kamala Harris, speaking as a former prosecutor, is simply trying to uphold the law. Trump is not above the law and he must be held accountable.
But charging an ex-President (even one as CORRUPT and CRIMINAL as Trump) is controversial, so we need to gauge support among informed California Democrats.

ASK MOE: POLICE REFORM IS COMING
We receive questions from voters all of the time and do our best to try to answer them. Here’s Moe’s response on policies involving police reform:
> “In the wake of the murder of George Floyd and many others, which have prompted both peaceful protests and violence in the streets across our country in recent weeks, I have been asked about police reform policies I would support.
> First, let me say that I believe this is a historic reckoning for the years and years of racial injustice. How we move forward from this moment will define who we are as a nation. We must be on the right side of history.
> As you may know, I have had many colleagues of color -- as a student at North Carolina Central University, where I earned my law degree, and as a law professor at Howard University. I have stood my whole professional life trying to fight injustice, wherever and however I encountered it. In Congress, I will do the same.
> We must change our culture and we can begin to do so by changing our laws. On the federal level, I support ending qualified immunity so that police officers can be held liable for violating the rights of people they serve. I would also push to establish a federal model policing program, adopting policies from the #8CantWait campaign that create standards of conduct and emphasize de-escalation and the use of non-lethal force. And it is long past time to make lynching a federal hate crime.
> Finally, we need to create a database to track complaints of officer misconduct, officer-involved shootings, use-of-force incidents and misuse of body cams, to begin to bring some accountability to our 18,000 police agencies across the country.
> Some of these policies are part of the House police reform bill – another effort at much needed change. And they are a good start. I look forward to continuing to improve on these when I am in Congress.
> Rest assured, change is coming. Finally.”
We will have more on this in the near future.
PRINCIPAL CHIEF SNEED JOINS MOE TALKS!
We are excited to announce that Richard G. Sneed, Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, will join Moe on Moe Talks on Thursday, July 9 at 7 p.m.
Principal Chief Sneed, a former Marine and longtime teacher, manages day-to-day operations for the 15,000-member EBCI based in the Qualla Boundary in Western North Carolina.
“I have a lot to learn about the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and what a member of Congress can do to be an effective advocate for their interests, so I’m grateful to Principal Chief Sneed for taking time to talk to me,’’ Davis said. “He and I are both military veterans and former educators, so we share a common commitment to our country and our communities.”
SAVING DACA
Imagine growing up in America, working hard to gain an education, earning a job and paying taxes like everyone else. Imagine living that American dream and then being told after doing everything right for years that you will have to move to a country you have never known because you weren't born here.
It's un-American. We are a nation of immigrants and those who were brought here as children and worked to fully contribute to our society have earned their place in it.
So we wholeheartedly support the Supreme Court decision handed down today that President Trump cannot end DACA -- Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals -- that protects these immigrants from deportation.
It is our hope, after the November election and when a new Congress is sworn in, that immigration reform will be a top priority and a path to citizenship is created for DACA recipients.
Once and for all.
ATTACKING WILDFIRES AND CLIMATE CHANGE
Wildfires are a reality for Western North Carolina, as many who were here in 2016 well know. We lost about 62,000 acres during a severe drought that fall.
We need to be better prepared for the next drought. To that end, the McDowell Community Wildfire Network has been created.
According to The McDowell News, “This is a partnership between local agencies including the city of Marion, McDowell County, Marion Fire Department, U.S. Forest Service, N.C. Forest Service, Mountain Valleys Resource Conservation and Development Council, the Nature Conservancy and others.
“The partnership was recently granted $40,000 from the Action, Implementation and Mitigation (AIM) grant program offered by an organization called Coalitions & Collaboratives, Inc. out of Lake George, Colo. This grant will support the partnership with program coordination, tracking mitigation activities, and acquiring mitigation equipment.”
You can read more about the partnership in this link, along with ways you can help prevent wildfires from damaging your home in the future.
Droughts are likely to become more common because of climate change. It is in our best interest in Western North Carolina to elect leaders who will actually listen to scientists and push for green energy and green technology to protect our environment.
We have too much to lose.
A JUNETEENTH TO REMEMBER
Last Friday was Juneteenth, the annual commemoration of the end of slavery in the United States. But this year it felt a little different, didn’t it?
There are still protests and marches in the streets across the U.S. over police violence against people of color. We are 155 years past June 19, 1865, when slavery ended in Texas, and yet there is still a need to speak out and demand equality.
So today, let’s speak out about the monuments across the country that celebrate Confederate war generals and other symbols of division. As petitions are submitted and heated arguments ensue in town halls and city councils everywhere, let’s remember on this Juneteenth what those monuments truly stand for and why they must come down.
The Confederate flag — that whole issue — was a battle to divide the country. It was a group of people that didn’t want United States. They wanted dis-United States. That was treasonous. So to have monuments glorifying this effort to divide the country, particularly knowing the message — what that conveys to a significant segment of the population — there’s just no sense in it.
This is an issue that should have been settled long ago, so it’s one that we need to settle. We ought to be focusing on issues that really matter, like getting healthcare and education. We ought to be focusing on those and not on honoring the past when that past is not something that was honorable.
So we support the efforts to remove the monuments and relocate them to an appropriate place that’s not public property.

APPLY FOR ABSENTEE BALLOT SOON
Given the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic and how it could impact voting in November, we are urging everyone in the 11th District to apply to vote by absentee ballot. You can go to this link for an application. You might want to wait until after Tuesday’s Republican runoff election to submit an application.
Voters have until Oct. 27 to request an absentee ballot, but we would recommend it be submitted well in advance so that the State Board of Elections isn’t inundated at the last minute and there isn’t any delay in getting the ballot back in time.
Reminder, you don’t have to vote by absentee ballot if you apply. But it is a great back-up if there are any disruptions and a reduction in polling locations due to the pandemic. Keep in mind that even if you apply now, you won’t actually receive an absentee ballot until September.
WE’LL KNOW OUR OPPONENT TOMORROW
The Republican runoff between Lynda Bennett and Madison Cawthorn will be held tomorrow, June 23, so we will finally know our opponent in the November election.
Not that it makes a difference. Republicans want to hold onto Mark Meadows’s old seat in Congress, and they have already spent $2 million to try to buy it even though the two candidates have no relevant experience for the job.
Don’t let them get away with it. Please.
We aren’t accepting corporate PAC money, so we need your contributions to fight for this seat.
Help us. Donate here.
Stay home. Stay safe. Stay healthy.

Sen. John Cornyn: How we can police our communities better
Reforms at the state and local levels will be the biggest drivers of change.
By John Cornyn
As published in the Dallas Morning News.
Facebook Twitter
Alternate text
Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., center, accompanied by from left, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, [[URL REDACTED]], and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., speaks at a news conference to announce a Republican police reform bill on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, June 17, 2020, in Washington.(Andrew Harnik)
The killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis was a brutal, senseless and avoidable tragedy, and one our country has witnessed countless times before. In many ways, his death was the match that ignited nationwide conversations about the racial injustices that have existed in our country for generations. These systemic problems have led to inequalities in everything from education, to health care, to housing, and while each of these must be addressed, the most important place to start is with police reforms.
In a recent poll conducted by The Washington Post and George Mason University, nearly 70% of Americans agreed that Floyd’s death was a sign of broader problems in the treatment of Black Americans by police. While there’s widespread agreement that change is needed, there’s no consensus on what that change should look like. In order to get there, it’s important to listen and learn from a variety of voices.
Over the past few weeks, I’ve teamed up with the mayors of both Dallas and Houston to host roundtable discussions with law enforcement, faith and community leaders. During our conversation in Dallas, Sheriff Marian Brown said, “We have to reach a point where we are comfortable having uncomfortable conversations.” Whether in Congress, workplaces or homes, these discussions aren’t easy, and for too long the topic has been avoided altogether. But progress can only happen if we’re having these important conversations and following up with action.
Reforms at the state and local levels will be the biggest drivers of change. This is where decisions are made about hiring, data sharing and day-to-day police activities. By and large, that’s a good thing — a one-size-fits-all rulebook would create more problems than solutions. But there are basic practices that should be standard across the board, and Congress has a responsibility to ensure all police departments are transparent, accountable and well-trained.
In the Senate, I’ve worked closely with Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., in developing the Just and Unifying Solutions to Invigorate Communities Everywhere Act to reform, retrain and restore trust in America’s police officers. This legislation helps end chokeholds and addresses no-knock warrants, two practices which — for good reason — have been brought into question by recent events. It ensures our officers receive critical de-escalation trainings, properly use body cameras, report critical data and are held accountable for mistakes. This legislation also improves minority hiring in police forces, orders a top-to-bottom review of our criminal justice system, and makes lynching a federal crime.
It takes a number of steps to deliver both immediate and lasting changes in communities across the country, and last week, the Senate took a routine procedural vote to begin working on this bill. Those voting yes – as I did – agreed to start the process of discussing, debating and amending this police reform bill. This wasn’t a vote to pass the bill, or preclude any changes, just a simple, straightforward step to get the process moving.
Unfortunately, Democrats blocked the bill. They prevented the Senate from even debating this legislation by claiming it was “inadequate.” They refused to negotiate, offer amendments, or try to engage in any meaningful or productive way. When given the opportunity to follow their calls for action with actual progress, they chose to simply vote “no.”
It was a disappointing show of priorities and a tremendous loss for our country, which is hungry for reform. Despite this setback, however, I will continue to press forward and encourage my colleagues to pass the sensible reforms we all agree are necessary.
During a roundtable discussion in Dallas a few weeks ago, Police Chief Renée Hall discussed how policing strategies over the years have created a wedge between law enforcement and their communities, and we’re going to have to work to fix it.
I don’t claim to have all the answers, but I’m confident that stonewalling the Senate will not lead to progress. Every person — regardless of skin color, political party, age or background — must be willing to do the work. This uncomfortable national conversation is long overdue, and it’s time we seize this opportunity to create real reforms. Instead of accepting “no,” it’s time to demand, “yes.”

80,"It’s no wonder this Epstein associate is applying the logic of an accused abuser to his defense. Enough is enough – help us send Trump packing once and for all >>
Alan Dershowitz, abuse enabler and Jeffrey Epstein apologist, went completely off the deep end yesterday defending the Abuser-in-Chief. He boldly claimed that the President is above the law and can do whatever he wants without consequence as long as he thinks his reelection is in the public interest.
Does this sound familiar to you? It’s the exact same logic Trump used in the horrifying Access Hollywood Tapes:
“When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do [[URL REDACTED]] them by the pussy.”
– Access Hollywood Tapes, 2005
It’s no wonder this Epstein associate is applying the logic of an accused abuser to his defense. Enough is enough – help us send Trump packing once and for all >>
KICK OUT THE ABUSER-IN-CHIEF
Dershowitz attempted damage control today by saying his comments were ‘distorted by the media,’ but we know his true intentions. Abuse enablers will always defend abusers – no matter how horrendous or disturbing the crime may be. Join us in our fight to hold accused abusers and their enablers accountable once and for all.

Subject: Trump’s legal team is stacked with accused abusers and abuse enablers
Alex,
President Trump’s impeachment trial has officially started in the Senate and he’s named two new problematic lawyers to his defense team: Kenneth Starr and Alan Dershowitz.
We’re not surprised that the Abuser-in-Chief hired an all-star squad of the worst abuse enablers and accused abusers in the country. Starr and Dershowitz join Brett Kavanaugh and nearly half a dozen other accused abusers and enablers that Trump has hired, nominated, or considered for higher office.
While the Abuser-in-Chief is armoring up with accused abusers and enablers, we’re leading the charge to hold him accountable. Help us send the Trump packing in 2020 by chipping into our grassroots fund >>

Republican senators have blatantly ignored the facts and will do anything to enable Trump. Now, the Abuser-in-Chief has even more despicable allies on his side: two men who have proven they’ll do anything to protect and enable rapists.
Starr led a massive cover-up of the rape of students by football stars at Baylor and was fired. Dershowitz helped pedophile rapist Jeffrey Epstein stay out of prison while also having his own disturbing sexual abuse allegations against him.
We’re not surprised that this is the message the Abuser-in-Chief wants to send for his impeachment: abusers will always enable abusers.
Trump is staffing his legal team with the worst accused abusers and enablers in America – it’s time to fight back. Help us kick out the Abuser-in-Chief for good by donating today.

We need to win nine races to flip the Texas House
We have 22 opportunities to do so. And if we do, then we can change Texas politics for a decade.
Imagine the impact of a progressive Texas Legislature leading redistricting. That means expanding Medicaid, increasing funding for public schools, using the Texas Rainy Day Fund to help every day Texans, and more.
We can do it. Many of these seats overlap several counties so if you live in a red, blue, or purple county at the presidential level - every vote counts at the legislative level!

# More Progress
Whether Dan Patrick agrees or not, it is time to take down Confederate monuments across Texas.
This week the RNC featured one of Trump’s favorite congressmen, Dan Crenshaw. We didn’t want to hear from him, so we gave the spotlight to his progressive challenger, Sima Ladjevardian.
Gov. Abbott was right to expand early vote by a week, but now Republicans are suing to take it away. Even when they get something right, they find a way to screw it up!
There has been a 700% increase in crimes committed by White House advisors during Trump Administration. Putting him in charge for “law and order” is like asking the wolf to guard the sheep.
Progress Texas is looking for a communications intern to join our team for the fall semester. Interns will receive $15/hour and the position is remote. Apply today!

Friends,
I hope this email finds you safe and well. As you may know, SB1 is being heard in Judiciary Committee today and makes its way through more committee hearings through Wednesday, when it will tentatively begin debate on the House Floor. I am watching Judiciary on live-stream as I write you, and I am sad. The reason I am running is because of lack of representation in this District. We are currently 2hrs 10mins into this hearing and Rep Christofanelli has asked exactly two questions - both of which had been asked, and answered, at least twice before. WHAT IS HE DOING?? Here is what I would have asked:
1\. Will lifting the residency rule really bring in 142 officers before it sunsets in 3 years and is it affordable? Or will investing in the City with more affordable housing and good schools be a more proactive approach?
2\. Chief Hayden admits guns are the biggest problem, why are we not addressing gun violence?
3\. If we want to reduce crime, cutting funding to education and spending money on incarceration does not solve the problem. (This is more in line with the original call for special session on social justice reform, not violent crime - they have an agenda.)
4\. Certifying minors to be tried as adults: again, providing these services BEFORE guns/knives get into the hands of minors makes a lot of sense and will likely help reduce the school-to-prison pipeline. How can we provide these services?[[URL REDACTED]] defunding education, invest in after-school programs and ensure kids are food and housing secure.
WHY is he NOT asking the questions for you? Here's why: Republicans, in Jefferson City, are hell bent on removing an elected Circuit Attorney in Saint Louis. Saint Charles Rep. Nick Schroer (R-107) and Senator Onder (R-2) added an amendment to SB1 stating the Governor has the sole authority to remove an elected official for, ""misconduct, willful neglect of duty, corruption or incompetency"", AND after the removal of said elected official, the Governor alone shall appointed a successor to the ELECTED official. This is not how we run a democracy. Why are we choosing to be a neglected constituency? It is time for you to have a Representative that will REPRESENT you and ask the right questions, without having a special agenda.
I am very concerned with a Bill Rep. Christofanelli has introduced this special session (HB24): exempting police officer's salaries from Missouri State income tax, without providing a method of where to compensate for this lost revenue. See how that breaks down in the graphic below. I will be making a trip to Jefferson City this week to watch floor debate and ask our Rep. the questions that need to be addressed.
On a new topic: there is some disconnect with teachers, administration and parents in FHSD on the safe re-opening of the school year. With only 21 days before school is set to start, our teachers and building staff need answers. Therefore, I will be attending this evening's County Council meeting, alongside FHEA to seek guidance from the Health Department and County Executive.
Keep an eye out this week, I will be giving you updates as they come from State and local government. You can keep up on my updates by following my Facebook, twitter and emails. I look forward to keeping you informed. In the mean-time, if you have any questions, my phone is always open to you.
Regards,
Chris

In 2016, he fooled far too many people into thinking he was a tough-talking success story who would “drain the swamp.” Four years later, the swamp has more snakes and he’s been revealed as a corrupt fraud.

90,"Hey Alex,
Yesterday, Patricia and Mark McCloskey were formally charged with unlawful use of a weapon after they were photographed pointing firearms at protestors. A few hours later, Missouri’s unelected Attorney General filed a brief asking the court to dismiss the case.
It is unprecedented for a sitting Attorney General to inject himself into a criminal case before the ink has even dried on the charges. Perhaps Eric Schmitt simply forgot that his office would be required to handle the appeal in this very case if there is a conviction. More likely, he decided once again it was in his own self-interest to score political points at the expense of a proper judicial process.
Prosecutors are supposed to follow the facts. But as usual, Eric Schmitt is just following the Republican playbook.
Whether or not the McCloskeys are guilty of a crime is for a court to decide, not an unelected politician like Eric Schmitt. With every move he makes, he confirms what we’ve been saying since the start of this campaign: he will always put his political ambitions over the pursuit of justice.
It’s time we had an Attorney General who is going to fix our justice system, not undermine it. If you’re with me, I need your help again now. We’re only two weeks away from the primary election, and we have the momentum to unseat Eric Schmitt. Can you chip in another $25, $50, or anything you can to help us send a message that we’re tired of Eric Schmitt wasting our tax dollars on political stunts like this?
Thanks again. I couldn’t do this without you.
-Rich

Friend,
I was very disappointed today to learn Representative Ben McAdams will be voting to impeach President Donald Trump. As many of you know, I have supported President Trump on several key issues, and I have disagreed with other decisions he has made. But the choice to impeach any president is much bigger than the person who currently holds the office. We must think about the future implications of how all future presidents will be treated. We must protect the highest office in the land from a highly politicized process. Let me tell you why I do not support the impeachment of our Commander-in-Chief.

A donation to my campaign is a donation to fight against the Democrats' politically motivated attack against President Donald Trump.
First, this is the fastest impeachment proceeding in our nation’s history. The Democrats could be taking the necessary time to find out the truth first hand, but they have admittedly rushed the process to affect the upcoming election. According to their statements, they are impeaching the President to influence the election, not to get to the truth.
Second, the Democrats have failed to produce a crime. This is important because our founding document states explicitly that a high crime or misdemeanor is required to impeach a president. This requirement is not a suggestion. The Democrats want you to believe that President Trump has committed a crime bay not allowing witnesses to testify and by refusing to hand over documents to Congress. This, too, is a mischaracterization of the facts. As was stated by Professor Jonathon Turley from George Washington University of Law, a President has the right to appeal to the Supreme Court when given a subpoena from Congress. This is the right of the President, and it cannot be seen as a violation of the law. If so, it would render the third branch of government irrelevant.
Regardless of whether or not we support this President’s policies, we must protect all future Presidents from politically motivated impeachment proceedings. Today Ben McAdams failed to do just that.
Join me now to protect future Presidents from being mercilessly attacked.

CAPITOL HILL REPORT
Ask your Rep to Cosponsor Peaceful Protests Act
September 10, 2020
Pittsburgh is the latest city that has been victim to violent protests. While the left and mainstream media continually label these protests as “peaceful,” we know that’s far from the truth. These protests have led to violent confrontations, the demolition of private property, and heavy looting of cities. There’s nothing peaceful about these gatherings and they couldn’t be farther from the vision our Founding Fathers had for the First Amendment and specifically the “right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”
What’s even more maddening about these protests is that the participants seem to be immune to the COVID-19 government-mandated guidelines to which the rest of the U.S. is subject. There’s been little to no talk or even a sense of frustration towards protestors who obviously are not following 6-foot social distancing from the leftists and are most likely benefitting from the hundreds of dollars government-funded COVID unemployment assistance. Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went to a hair salon in a still “shut down” California. This simple act has left many Americans second-guessing whether or not the hair salon owner tricked Pelosi, as the Speaker claims. It sure seems like the Left lets any behavior slide that affirms their agenda, no matter how hypocritical.
Thankfully, Congressman Jim Banks (R-IN) introduced the Support Peaceful Protests Act or H.R. 8117. This legislation attempts to address the hypocrisy seen in the “peaceful” protests by holding accountable “arrested rioters who were caught committing crimes like acts of violence, looting, or vandalism to pay for the cost of federal policing of the riot and be ineligible for federal unemployment assistance.” As Congressman Banks said:
“Antifa thugs are descending on suffering communities, disrupting peaceful protests and leaving violence, looting and vandalism in their wake. They turned Milwaukee, Seattle, and Portland into warzones, and now they’re moving the chaos to Kenosha, Wisconsin. Who knows which community is next? Due to enhanced federal benefits, taxpayers are giving wages to jobless rioters that are destroying our communities. We need to cut them off from their funding and make them feel the full financial consequences of their actions.”
American taxpayers should not be funding the destruction of our communities and Eagle Forum is thankful to Congressman Banks for introducing H.R. 8117. Please check to see if your Representative is a co-sponsor of this important piece of legislation here. And if your Representative hasn’t yet joined as a cosponsor, please ask him or her to do so here.

BREAKING NEWS: Adam Schiff reports “real prospect of jail time” for Trump post‑Presidency
Do you think Donald Trump should be put on trial for his crimes after leaving office?

This is an official Progressive Turnout Project opinion poll. Please respond even if you are “Unsure”. You have 3 minutes to submit your answer.
Donald Trump has been abusing his position since the first day he became president.
He’s used his power and influence to end criminal investigations and avoid conviction.
And enough is enough. Trump needs to be held accountable for his crimes.
But Congress will only charge Trump if it’s what the American people want.
That’s why we’re issuing an urgent public opinion poll today to gauge what our top supporters think. And we really need to hear from you:

Dear Friends-
Presidential debates are about having a discussion around competing visions and plans for the country explained, deconstructed and evaluated. What we witnessed last night was the President of the United States devolving the format into a barrage of lies, interruptions, and a round-up posse directive to the Proud Boys that they were so delighted to receive, they’ve updated their logo.
After sifting through a lot of the feedback and social and the headlines today, there are some takeaways that we need your help in doing. A lot of people went to bed upset but fired up to see Trump go. Don’t miss that last part in seeing this as an organizing moment.
Because there was only one leader on the stage of last night’s Presidential debate, and that leader was Vice President Joe Biden. That leader stood up for our lives under the mismanagement of this pandemic and the economy, called out racism and fought to focus on the welfare of our families even as attacks were unleashed against his own family.
Trump had no plan, and Vice President Biden confronted him about that fact. He told a host of lies during the debate on health care, climate change, voting, and jobs but there was one moment when he finally admitted his plans to cut health care. He said outright “we’re cutting health care.” We’ve known all along that health care was on the ballot and he has just confirmed it.
The time is now for us to ensure that the folks with knots in their stomachs remember that people have already been voting in record numbers and they are cutting our way disproportionately. The goal right now is to keep turning people out, helping them to get good information on how to vote ([[URL REDACTED]]), and to keep scaling up our voter protection efforts.
Last night’s debate gave us additional fuel and urgency. We need to get our communities to vote and vote early. Trump has given the orders to a known hate group to “stand back and stand by”. They have their orders. But as Princess Philomena Desmond, who is one of the Co-Chairs of the African Diaspora for Biden, said to me today, “Our Joe struck back and he spoke directly to the people which Trump never did. But we have to be prepared for the days ahead”. Mama Philomena, I agree. So folks please read down for some of our asks.
We will send out information again next Wednesday, October 7th for the Vice Presidential debate.
In Solidarity,
Mũthoni

TALKERS MESSAGING TOPLINES
Supreme Court
TOPLINE: Justice Ginsburg’s successor will have a profound impact on every part of our lives and our future. The American people have a right to have a say who the Supreme Court Justice is. They aren’t getting that chance. We are in the middle of an election. Tens of thousands have already voted. We should wait and see what the outcome is.
* For voters, this isn’t about who is sitting on the Court, it’s about the issues that hang in the balance: health care, clean air and water, whether you make equal pay for equal work and the rights of voters, immigrants, women, and workers.
* Amy Coney Barrett has a written track record of disagreeing with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision upholding the Affordable Care Act. She critiqued Chief Justice John Roberts’ majority opinion upholding the law in 2012.
* President Trump is right now fighting in the Supreme Court to strip health coverage away from millions of people in the middle of a global health crisis. The Supreme Court has twice already upheld the Affordable Care Act as constitutional.
* If Trump succeeds and his appointment votes to scrap the entire Affordable Care Act - insurers could once again discriminate or drop coverage completely for more than 100 million people living with preexisting conditions. Including the 7 million Americans who may have lung scarring and heart damage from COVID-19.
* The majority of the American people believe the winner of the election should nominate Justice Ginsburg's successor.
* Millions of voters are already casting their ballots. They should have their voices heard on who serves on the Court.
Health Care
TOPLINE: President Trump has no health care plan - he wants to take it away. He is right now fighting in the Supreme Court to eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act If he succeeds, he will strip health coverage away from tens of millions of families and to strip away the peace of mind from more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions.
* If President Trump has his way, complications from COVID-19 will be the next deniable pre-existing conditions.
* Since he started running for President, Trump said that he will have a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act and that he’ll have a plan to protect pre-existing conditions. He’s had four years to level with the American people and put forward a plan. Now 40 days to the Election, he’s once again saying trust me - I’ll figure it out later.
* Simply put: Trump doesn’t have a plan. His only plan he has is to get re-elected.
* There is only one candidate in the race who fought shoulder to shoulder with President Obama to expand access to health care for more than 20 million Americans and to protect more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions - That’s Joe Biden. And as President, he will build on that work.
COVID-19
200,000 people are dead and 7 million are infected in the United States. We have 4% of the world population and are at 20% of the deaths. And as 1,000 Americans die every day, President Trump says, “It is what it is.” Well “it is what it is” because President Trump you are who you are.
This is the man who said it would be gone by Easter. He said it would go away when it got warm. He said it would end like a miracle. Why would you believe his promises now? Joe Biden trusts scientists. He trusts vaccines. But he does not trust Donald Trump.
TOPLINE: President Trump failed in the primary responsibility of the President: the duty to protect the safety of the American people. Even worse, he lied to the American people about the danger posed by COVID-19. Trump said he didn’t tell people the truth because he didn't want them to panic. The only person to panic was Donald Trump. He froze in the headlights, and the results were catastrophic for American families.
* 200,000 people have died, 30 million are out of work and Trump failed to do his job.
* How many families are missing a loved one at their dinner table – because of his failures?
* No President whose lies and failures have cost 200,000 Americans their lives should keep his job. Period.
* If Biden were president now, here’s what he would do:
1) Everyone in this country would be wearing a mask when around other people.
2) He’d get the testing fiasco fixed.
3) Biden would get protective gear to everyone on the front lines
4) And he’d issue guidelines for our schools and businesses, and get them aid to implement them.
* Those are four things Trump isn’t doing, and doesn’t have any intention of doing.
* Tragically, if we continue on the path Trump is on, the worst is not behind us, it’s ahead.
Park Avenue vs. Scranton
TOPLINE: Biden sees this election as Park Avenue versus Scranton. President Trump can see only as far as Wall Street, and looks down on working people. Biden will build our country back better to help working families, not the super-wealthy and corporations.
* Joe Biden knows that Wall Street bankers and CEOs didn’t build this country — the middle class and working families did — hardworking people from Scranton and Claymont, small businesses and entrepreneurs and unions built this country.
* The question for voters across the country: is the Trump economy working for YOU and YOUR FAMILY?
* President Trump has no intention of making it better for you and your family at home.
* The top 100 billionaires in America have made more than $300 billion this year.
* President Trump wants to give them a $30 billion tax break. He's going to cut their tax rate so they pay a lower rate than a working family making $65,000 a year.
* Biden is going to make the super-wealthy pay their fair share. And, he’s going to:
* Enforce “Buy American” rules – for real - so that when we spend American taxpayer dollars it’s on goods made in America -- and penalize companies that ship jobs overseas.
* Create more jobs by investing in clean energy – windmills and solar plants and electric cars.
* Raise pay for child care workers and teachers and health care workers.
* Moody’s Analytics released their analysis of both Joe Biden and President Trump’s economic plans\- or as we like to say, the Scranton plan vs. the Park Avenue plan.
* Key finding of the analysis is that Joe Biden is the jobs creator.
* Moody’s found that Biden’s plan will create 18.6 million jobs by the end of his first term -- 7 million *more* jobs than President Trump’s plan.
* Biden’s plan will grow the economy by almost $1 trillion more than Trump’s by 2024.
* Biden is the one with the strategic plan to grow our economy by investing in working families and our infrastructure. His plan will lead to higher homeownership and billions in more disposable income for American families. That’s what makes our economy healthy in the long-run.
* Trump only looks out for the super-wealthy and that doesn’t work for the economy in the long run.
President Trump’s Taxes
TOPLINE: President Trump can see only as far as Wall Street, and looks down on working people. If you make under $400,000, you will not pay a penny more in taxes when Joe Biden is president. Period. Contrast that with President Trump who now in the middle of this pandemic is proposing another tax giveaway for the wealthiest Americans.
* Trump’s tax giveaway went to the super-wealthy and corporations.
* 83% of the benefits will ultimately go to the top 1% and 40% of the benefits went to foreign investors.
* 91 Fortune 500 companies paid no federal taxes last year.
* The top 100 billionaires in America have made more than $300 billion this year. Donald Trump wants to give them a $30 billion tax break -- in the middle of a pandemic and an economic crisis.
* $30 billion more, just for those 100 folks. Trump is going to cut the super wealthy’s tax rate so they pay a lower rate than a working family making $65,000 a year.
* Joe Biden will make the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share, and invest that revenue in the middle class and growing our economy - expanding access to affordable health care, making community college tuition-free, investing in our public schools, repairing our roads and bridges, and more.
* Joe Biden is proposing tax cuts for working families:
* As long as the COVID crisis rages, he will expand the Child Tax Credit to help families. That means a firefighter with three teenagers will receive an additional $3,000 -- or $9,000 total.
* He’ll expand tax credits for child care, which could mean up to $6,800 in additional tax relief each year for such families.
* He’ll give first-time homebuyers a $15,000 advanceable tax credit for their down payment.
* And, he’ll increase tax credits to lower health care premiums, too.
Donald Trump and Race
Trump had multiple chances to say he disowned white supremacy. He refused. Donald Trump fans the flame of white supremacy and racism. It’s his only political strategy.
Equity, equality, and justice – the American creed. We have never lived up to it; but we’ve never stopped trying until this President.
Joe Biden got into this race because of Charlottesville. After seeing hate-filled men with torches spilled out of the woods spewing racism and anti-Semitic bile, Donald Trump said there were “very fine people on both sides.” Those words shocked our conscience and stunned the world.
This summer, after George Floyd was killed, President Trump hid in the White House bunker. Then he ordered force against peaceful protestors outside the White House, gassing Americans to stage a photo op of him holding a Bible outside a church.
1 in 1000 African Americans has been killed by COVID-19, and if Trump doesn't do something fast by the end of year, it will be 1 in 500. This man has done virtually nothing for Black Americans.
TOPLINE: President Trump turns Americans against each other and fuels toxic racism for his own political gain. He has no desire to unite Americans to move our country forward. Division is his primary political strategy. It’s wrong, and it’s not who we are as a country.
* After neo Nazis and white supremacists marched in Charlottesville, he said there were “very fine people on both sides.”
* Following the tragic murder of George Floyd, as millions of Americans stood up for healing and justice, Trump actively fanned hate and even encouraged violence.
* Hate crimes have surged on his watch, he has admitted that he’s trying to keep Black Americans from exercising their sacred right to vote, slandered the Latino community, sought to bar Muslims from even entering the United States, presided over a spike in anti-Semitism, and regularly tries to scapegoat fellow Americans as “the other” in order to distract from his massive failures.
Law and Order with Justice
TOPLINE: Law and order with justice - where everyone is treated fairly. Donald Trump isn’t a law and order president. He’s a president who breaks the law and creates disorder. Joe Biden has condemned violence in every form it takes – while President Trump has failed to stand up to his own supporters and unequivocally condemn violence. Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is reelected?
* When President Trump says, “You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America,” he’s talking about what’s happening in President Trump’s America.
* President Trump failed to protect America so now he is trying to scare America.
* He owns this chaos yet proudly touts himself as a ‘law and order’ president.
* When President Trump says “you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America”, look around at President Trump’s America:
* COVID runs unchecked throughout the country and has killed thousands while sending our economy spiraling.
* The murder rate is up 26% in cities across the nation under Donald Trump.
* More cops have died of COVID-19 this year than on patrol.
* President Trump continues to fan the flames of division and encourage chaos.
* We must stand against violence – in every form it takes:
* The violence of unwarranted police shootings, excessive force, of extremists, and more.
* The senseless violence of looting and burning and destruction of property.
* When President Trump looks at this violence and sees a political lifeline. Joe Biden is offering a different vision. He’s going to bring Americans together to address the challenges our country faces.
Climate Change
When Donald Trump thinks of climate he thinks “hoax”. When Joe Biden thinks of climate change, he thinks jobs- good paying union jobs.
And Joe Biden will rejoin the Paris Climate Accord because without us it’s falling apart. He’ll host a summit for the world’s leading emitters in his first 100 days, and persuade them to up the ante, and increase their emissions goals.
TOPLINE:
* As a nation, we face one of the most difficult moments in our history. Four historic crises. COVID, the economy, racial justice and climate change - all at the same time.
* Once again, President Trump fails the most basic duty to this nation -- he fails to protect us. We are not safe in President Trump’s America.
* Wildfires are burning the suburbs in the West. Floods are wiping out suburban neighborhoods in the Midwest. And, hurricanes are imperiling suburban life along our coasts. The impacts of climate change don't pick and choose red states or blue states.
* Which makes President Trump’s climate denialism — his disdain of science and facts — all the more confounding.
* The unrelenting impact of climate change affects every single one of us. But too often the brunt falls disproportionately on communities of color, exacerbating the need for environmental justice.
* Every American has a fundamental right to breathe clean air and drink clean water.
* Our economy can’t recover if we don’t build back with more resiliency to withstand extreme weather that will only come with more frequency.
* When President Trump thinks of climate change, he thinks hoax. When Joe Biden thinks of climate change, he thinks jobs - good paying union jobs.
* We need a president who respects science, who understands that the damage from climate change is already here, and, unless we take urgent action, will soon be more catastrophic. A president who recognizes, understands, and cares that Americans are dying.
* As President, Biden will send Congress in the first 100 Days a sweeping plan for a clean-energy revolution:
* Build a 100%-clean-energy economy – creating millions of jobs to power our recovery.
* Invest record amounts in research and innovation – more than we spent to put a man on the moon.
* Build a more resilient infrastructure, more efficient power grid, and 500,000 public charging stations for electric cars.
Voting
President Trump is using scare tactics to undermine voting-by-mail. But the truth is: Trump himself just voted-by-mail in Florida’s primary, and his campaign is promoting it for its own supporters.
Our military has been voting by mail since the Civil War.
Joe Biden refuses to let Donald Trump undermine faith in our democracy.
If President Trump says he won't accept the results of the election it doesn't matter. If we get the votes, he has to go.
The American people have it in our power to determine what’s going to happen and if we want four more years of these lies.
Go to [[URL REDACTED]] right now to make a plan to vote early.
TOPLINE: The American people are going to vote and determine the next President of the United States.
* The Biden campaign has launched the biggest voter protection program in history: thousands of staff on the ground, lawyers, and poll watchers throughout the states to ensure every eligible voter who wants to can do so.
* The campaign is aggressively answering efforts by Trump and his allies here at home and overseas to suppress voting.
* This includes:
* State programs-- recruiting and ensuring poll workers and safe polling locations.
* Anti-voter suppression programs-- preventing Republicans from putting up obstacles to voting and from using supposed emergency powers to intimidate voters and attack or subvert our democratic processes.
* Voter registration and education programs-- registering voters, and ensuring they have the information they need to vote by mail or in person.
* Guarding against foreign interference and cyberattacks-- protecting against abuse of platforms and voter misinformation from domestic and foreign sources.

Friend,
Joe Biden is our pick for president -- and we need him now more than EVER!
But as the November election approaches, we want to know, friend:
Would you vote for a Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ticket?
Take our live poll NOW:
As you know, Joe Biden has pledged to select a woman as his Vice President. We 100% agree!
And California’s own Senator Kamala Harris is a ROCKSTAR. She led the charge against the confirmation of Bill Barr, has authored a bill to make lynching a federal hate crime and has been a LIFELONG ally and champion for our LGBTQ+ community. As California’s attorney general, she worked with Equality California to OUTLAW the so-called “gay and trans panic” defense, which allowed defendants to blame their anti-LGBTQ+ attacks on the victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity.
So, we want to know, would you vote for a Joe Biden/Kamala Harris ticket this November? Take our LIVE poll right now >>
Joe could make his VP announcement ANY DAY NOW. Tell us ASAP if you would support a Biden/Harris ticket:

DAN CRENSHAW FOR CONGRESS
Alex -
Texas vs California. Good governance vs bad governance.
This is what’s at stake in November. Click here or on the image above to watch and share this with your friends.
Democrats are spending millions to flip the Texas State House, and our State Rep candidates desperately need help. It’s an emergency. Our prosperity is on the line.
Associated Republicans of Texas is working hard to support these candidates. Please chip in ANY AMOUNT IMMEDIATELY to help them GET OUT THE VOTE.
CHIP IN TO SAVE TEXAS
In Service,
Dan Crenshaw
FULL TRANSCRIPT
What makes for good governance?
Safe communities, Less regulations, lower taxes, and minimal interference from government - Giving people the freedom to make their own choices.
And what does bad governance look like?
Defunding the police, refusing to enforce the law, more regulations, higher taxes, and a government-knows-best attitude.
Don’t believe me? Well lets compare a large state run by Democrats, California, to a large state run by Republicans, Texas.
California, a beautiful state with millions of hardworking Americans. California rose to prosperity under Republican governance, but in recent decades it has been devastated by one party, Democrat rule. An unemployment rate of more than 11% - one of the highest in the country. The 4th highest electricity prices in the country. Rolling blackouts, forest fires, rising crime and homelessness.
The Tax Foundation ranks California 48th in terms of business climate. California is also ranked 48th in terms of regulatory burdens. And California’s cost of living is 50 percent higher than the national average.
Now, people are fleeing the state in droves. Businesses are closing down by the thousands. Jobs are leaving the state in record numbers.
In just 2018 and 2019—economic boom years—765 commercial facilities left California. Large companies like Toyota, Charles Schwab, and Jamba Juice.
An estimated 13,000 businesses left between 2008 and 2016. 275,000 jobs left the state and $76 billion in capital funds were diverted during the same period.
And where are these jobs fleeing to? Texas.
More than 86,000 people moved to Texas from California in 2018 alone. A U-Haul from Los Angeles to Houston costs more than $2,000. A U-Haul from Houston to Los Angeles costs $600.
The reason is simple. We have smart policies that work. We empower people instead of trying to control them.
Texas has no personal income tax. Our unemployment rate is just half of California’s even though our COVID trends were similar. Texas has some of the lowest electricity prices in the country. Texas is the best state in America to start a new business, according to studies.
We also treat the environment better. We are a leader in energy innovation and wind power, and our emphasis on private land ownership makes it much easier to manage forests and prevent wildfires.
So you have to ask yourself, why switch form good governance to bad governance?
Millions of dollars are flooding into Texas to make our state more like California. They’re trying to “Turn Texas Blue” and they won’t stop until they control our state legislature, control the Governor’s mansion, and flip our U.S. House and Senate Seats.
We have to stop them.
The front line of this defense to save Texas is the Texas State House, and we have incredible young, diverse candidates that need our help as they fight against millions of dollars of out-of-state donations from the likes of far-left billionaires like Mike Bloomberg and George Soros.
We need to keep Texas prosperous. We need to Keep Texas free. We need to keep Texas REPUBLICAN.
When you donate to Associated Republicans of Texas, you donate to a one stop shop for saving the Texas State House. We need your help. Its all on the line. Donate today, save Texas.
