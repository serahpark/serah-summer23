      "There was some tragic news this past weekend here in the Bronx. Two NYPD officers were shot while sitting in their patrol car in an assassination style attack.\n",
      "I'm praying for their quick recovery, and for their families, and I hope that you will join me.\n",
      "Unfortunately, these horrible attacks are merely the latest in a series of anti-police violence. The left has been demonizing our law enforcement officers for years now, and this is the result of that endless propaganda.\n",
      "Attacks like these prove that there needs to be a dramatic change in the way that New York City politicians act towards cops. And it has to start at the top.\n",
      "Mayor Bill de Blasio has repeatedly undermined the hardworking officers of the NYPD and allied himself with leftist extremists. The radicals he's siding with are demanding police officers stop carrying guns, and stop patrolling crime ridden neighborhoods!\n",
      "You and I both know that is no way to protect New York families.\n",
      "The Sergeant's Benefit Association, a major New York City police organization, has had enough of Mayor Bill de Blasio's attitude towards police. They tweeted the following after the recent attacks:\n",
      "This tweet is proof that liberal New York City politicians have failed our police officers. The left has created the violent atmosphere that lead to these attacks, and that must be ended before anyone else gets hurt.\n",
      "Our police officers need support at the federal level too, and they will have it unreservedly when I am elected to Congress.\n",
      "As a former NYPD officer myself, backing the blue will be a top priority for me in Congress after I defeat AOC this November.\n",
      "Our police officers need to know that the politicians who represent them have their backs, and I will. I served as a police officer here in the Bronx, and with New York City's Harbor Unit.\n",
      "That service taught me what our cops need to do their jobs - they need to know the public respects and supports them.\n",
      "If you support our police officers, and want another ally of law enforcement in Congress, please join our campaign to defeat AOC right now. I need real Americans like you to fight against the radical socialists donating millions to her campaign.\n",
      "With your help, we can put an end to this anti-police propaganda, and restore honest representation to the people of the 14th District who deserve change.\n",

      "Dear friends,\n",
      "Paterson is a monument to machine politics in America. While the good times roll for politicians, entire communities have been destroyed by corruption. Incomes are dropping, apartheid schools are increasing, and infrastructure is crumbling for the ordinary residents of Paterson. The model of championing certain parts of a beleaguered rust belt city and abandoning the rest is simply racial segregation by another name. Not surprisingly, Paterson is one of the most violent cities in the country. During a federal investigation, Paterson police officers admitted to dealing drugs, robbing and beating citizens, and illegally stopping and searching drivers. Paterson is a city in turmoil.\n",
      "Jameek Lowery\n",
      "On January 5, 2019, Jameek Lowery (1) walked into a Paterson police station, (2) live streamed a video in which he repeatedly asked police officers for water and to not kill him, (3) entered an ambulance where police officers used physical force and compliance holds to secure him, and (4) arrived at the hospital in an unresponsive state with severe facial injuries. Jameek Lowery died in the hospital within two days. When peaceful protestors gathered outside Paterson City Hall for days to demand answers, Paterson police used mace and arrested the leaders of the protests. Regardless of the cause of death in this case, walking into a police station should not be the last conscious act of any person in America.\n",
      "Criminal justice reform\n",
      "Police violence against unarmed minorities led to the deaths of countless men and women around the country. Black men are sentenced to 19% more jail time for committing the exact same crime as white men, and black Americans are jailed at more than five times the rate of whites. We have more people in jail than any other country on earth. We need real criminal justice reform both for our district and for America.\n",
      "We will bring about major police department reform. We will reform civil asset forfeitures. We will end the war on drugs, and replace jail with treatment for minor drug offenses. We will abolish the death penalty and end all mandatory minimums. We will eliminate private prisons and detention centers, which are financially incentivized to hold as many people for as long as possible.\n",
