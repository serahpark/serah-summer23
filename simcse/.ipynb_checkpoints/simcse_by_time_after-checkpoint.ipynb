      "### The Left Now Wants to Abolish the Police\n",
      "Over the last week, those on the left, and their sympathizers in the mainstream media, have ramped up their radical demand to abolish, defund, dismantle, and even outright ban police departments.

      "This past week has been a particular challenging time in our nation's history.

      "Protests have arisen in cities all over America, peaceful gatherings that are no doubt our constitutional right. Unfortunately, these protests have been sullied by violence and looting. In this week's blog, I discuss this turmoil and offer some words of hope.\n",
