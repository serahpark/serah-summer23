Kathleen Williams for Congress
Thank you for joining the team!
When people put their faith in you, help build a movement bigger than yourself, when they look you in the eye and tell you they believe in you -- you don’t give up. You double down.
I'm proud to be running to be Montana’s lone representative in the U.S. Congress. Montanans want and deserve change. Let's do this together.
Help me build a winning campaign with a $10 or $25 contribution today.
From here, we’ll hit the campaign trail hard. I will be traveling back and forth across the state, meeting people of all political stripes and planning the future of our state together.
I need you with me in this effort! Chip in $10 or $25 right now.
Let’s win this,

Hi there,
Thanks for joining the team! My name is Kathleen Williams, and I’m proudly running to be Montana’s lone representative in the U.S. Congress.
I’m running so that everyday Montanans have someone to stand up for them. I come from a past rooted in hard work and I’m comfortable rolling up my sleeves to get a job done—whether that be in the rivers in rural Montana or passing legislation in the Montana Capitol as a state representative.
Now I want to hear from you. Can you take a moment to let me know what your most pressing issues are by quickly filling out a quick survey?
I have spent my 36-year career working with people of all political stripes to find win-win solutions to meet Montana’s most urgent needs, including affordable health care, good-paying jobs and protecting Montana's outdoor heritage.
Kathleen Williams: Candidate for U.S. Congress \(MT-AL\)
Since kicking off my campaign earlier this year, I’ve spent the last few months on the road talking with folks all across Montana. Farmers and ranchers. Nurses and teachers. Hunters and anglers. Tribal members and leaders. Because at the end of the day, we can’t solve our problems by staying in our own corners.
I’m excited for the rest of the journey and I look forward to keeping you updated from the campaign trail.
Right now, I really want to hear from you, though. Can you take a moment to let me know what’s on your mind? I can’t overstate how important it is to hear from you about what matters to you.
Thank you,
Kathleen Williams

Supporters,
Today, we remember and honor the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his contributions to our country. It’s no overstatement to say that he fundamentally changed the course of our country, and his impact lives on today.
“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”
Dr. King
Dr. King’s actions still hold important lessons we can’t forget: when we come together for the common good, we’re all better for it.
There is still work to be done to ensure everyone has equal, unrestricted access to the ballot box and beyond -- and that’s a mission I will take with me to Congress this November. I’m honored to have you along for the journey.
In remembrance of Dr. King,
Kathleen Williams

Here’s the truth, summer is the most difficult fundraising season for any campaign -- even though it’s our most critical.
And with July quickly coming to an end, we need to close the $15,289 gap that still stands between us and our end-of-month fundraising drive. Will you chip in $15 to help us catch up to where we should be today?

Unless we get a second wind of support, there’s no path that will get us to our goal before July ends. That means we’ll have to make serious budget cuts that will affect our online ads, our radio airtime and even our staffing.
That would mean we’re losing out on key resources to get Kathleen elected. But we still have time before Friday’s midnight deadline. Will you rush in a contribution of any amount to help us fund our program throughout the summer?
Thank you,

Please be safe and follow CDC guidance during the coronavirus outbreak. As our country works through this difficult time, please join me in reaching out to those in need or who are feeling isolated - we are all in this together.
This has been a whirlwind of a year for Kathleen and the team, and we wanted to update you on how far we’ve come since we launched our campaign last year.
But we’re not hitting the brakes just yet. We need to continue to keep up our historic momentum all the way until November 3rd. Your $10 donation helps us keep the entire campaign running at full speed. Will you chip in right now?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Here’s where 2020 has taken us so far:
1. Since March, we’ve been tied with our Trump-endorsed, Republican opponent Matt Rosendale 47-47. This is anybody’s race to win -- and to lose.
2. We SWEPT the Montana Democratic Primaries this June, taking in 89.5% of the vote. This was an astounding message that our supporters are ready to fight all the way to November.
3. Our race was added to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s Red to Blue list because they believe we’re one of the BEST pickup opportunities in the country.
And those are just some of the many moments that have shifted and changed this race. We’re not done fighting yet, and with the summer being our busiest season yet, what we do now will determine whether we’re successful on election night.
That’s why it’s all hands on deck at Team Kathleen. If you’re ready to jump into the race and help elect Kathleen, rush in $10, or $30, right now. It’s supporters like you who will help bring us a historic victory this November.
Thank you,

Politics right now are divisive. I’ve worked my entire career to bridge such divides. Right now, honesty, independence and forward-thinking are sorely needed in D.C. and I’m ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work finding our common ground so we can move forward on solutions for Montana and our nation.

These goals are important because they fund all the work we do digitally to meet Montanans -- especially when we can’t meet them in person.
We can’t jeopardize our resources by taking a back seat. We’re reaching out to every supporter we can to build our ability to keep our ads running and keep in touch with the communities that will carry us to Washington in November.
But our chances of making that possible disappear with any goal for which we fall short. Help us close out May strong by sending in $10 before Sunday’s deadline.

Team -- Thank you for the incredible hard work you’ve put in this past month.
Not only did we surpass our fundraising goal for February, but we’re now standing on stronger footing as we move closer to Election Day.
Everything we do from hitting the road, meeting voters, sending out flyers and running online ads is powered entirely by your donations. Because of you, we’re well on our way to building the strongest campaign Montana has ever seen.
For that, I want to say thank you.
But, the most important thing to me in running this race is listening to Montanans. That’s why we spend time on the road reaching as many communities as possible. Now we have another opportunity to ensure that your voice is heard.
Take my new survey for March, and let me know what’s the top issue you fight for or face every day. Your response shapes my agenda as we move closer to November. We take every chance we get to listen to the voters, and this is one of the most powerful tools we have.
Thank you,

It’s official, we won the primary!
We are now the official Democratic campaign that will stand against Matt Rosendale in November’s historic election. But already he and his allies are misrepresenting me and my record.
It’s time for the final sprint.
We’re on track to make history in Montana, but it’s not going to be an easy road; we’re up against a mountain of dark money resources. Will you chip in to help us fend off whatever outside national Republican Super PACs throw at us to defeat our campaign?

Republicans are scared that one of their own is going to lose this election. They’re worried that a real independent leader for Montana is going to make decisions that put Montanans first and will find solutions by working across the aisle.
Let’s make sure that their fears come true. It’s not an easy road to Washington, but it’s one we’ll travel together. Help us build a winning path ahead by chipping in $12.

Kathleen Williams for Congress
Team,
Today, we’re one month away from November’s General Election.
This election will help determine the future of Montana. While Kathleen continues to fight for small businesses, public lands and protecting our communities’ health and safety, our Republican opponent would rather fight for his insurance donors.
But right now, our race is still neck and neck. We are just 31 days away from the most important elections of our lifetimes. Will you help change the tide of the race and push Kathleen forward with a $15 donation today?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50
$100 $250 Other
Kathleen is ready to take her years of experience to be Montana’s only voice in the House. But national GOP groups are spending millions of dollars to muddy the waters and make Montana sound more like Washington.
Let’s show them that no dollar amount they throw at us will change this fact of the race: Kathleen is the best choice for our future. Help build our path forward with a $15 donation today.
Thank you,
Blake Thompson

Let me tell you when I saw this headline, my jaw dropped.
Senators used their position of power to sell off millions of dollars worth of stock while our nation faces the worst public health crisis we’ve faced in decades.
Enough is enough! It’s time to put a stop to the status quo and elect a leader who will fight corruption on Day 1. I know Kathleen is that leader, and I need your help to send her independent voice to Congress in November. Will you sign the pledge today?

Kathleen Williams for Congress
This is downright corrupt:
This is what happens when we let corrupt public officials lead. Instead of finding solutions to the worst pandemic in decades, four senators sold off millions of dollars worth of stock to benefit their own personal fortunes.
This is exactly the kind of lack of ethics Kathleen has stood against since Day 1.
No matter what branch of government, it’s up to us to elect public officials dedicated to ending corruption everywhere. That’s why we need to send a clear message that we stand for public service, not profiteering
Will you add your name to our team's pledge to send real and authentic leadership like Kathleen’s to Congress?
Kathleen’s independent and honest voice is what we need fighting for Montanans. She’ll put our best interests first, not her pocketbook.
We need Kathleen’s leadership on Capitol Hill now. If you’re ready to elect a corruption busting, resource-saving representative, add your name to our pledge to send Kathleen to Congress!
Thank you,

Kathleen Williams for Congress
Right now, our country is facing a healthcare crisis. What makes that even worse? Soaring prescription drug prices.
When it’s cheaper to get prescription drugs from Canada, you know we have a problem. There’s no good reason why the richest country in the world is forcing people to choose between filling their prescriptions and keeping the lights on.
But that’s the reality for countless Montanans. We need action. We need 5,000 of Kathleen’s grassroots team to sign her newest petition: Demand the Senate take action to lower prescription drug costs.
Critical drugs to manage diabetes, address heart disease, and shrink tumors all continue to have skyrocketing costs. Some even cost over $20,000 for one month’s supply.
There’s no more room to just sit by. Sick Montanans need advocates and it’s up to us to ensure their voices are heard by raising ours.
Stand with Montanans today. Add your name to Kathleen’s petition. Let’s lower prescription drug prices together.

Folks, November’s elections will be the most important in recent memory.
For us in Big Sky Country, that means rejecting politicians who’d rather be buddy-buddy with industry insiders, than protect our communities and public lands. That’s why we have to stand with Kathleen Williams as she fights to be a representative for the people.
This race is one of the most competitive in the country. We need to all work together to keep Kathleen’s campaign running strong as she works to flip Montana’s lone House seat from red to blue. Rush in $25 right now to make it possible.

Democrats are facing a flood of opposition. Not only is the Montana GOP hustling every donor they can find, they’ve welcomed in the same type of Washington GOP groups that attacked me two years ago to tilt the election in Maryland Matt’s favor.
We can’t let their efforts go unopposed. That’s why we need your $25 today.
People are stronger than the big special interests. That’s why I’m joining the fight and mobilizing as many people as possible to get Kathleen elected in November. The primaries are over, Kathleen will be our champion in November’s elections and she needs a strong grassroots team standing with her.
Will you stand with me and Kathleen and fight to elect her to Congress in 2020? Chip in today.

There’s a lot of lies being spread about me and my record, so I wanted to tell you why I'm fighting to get to Congress.
As a natural resource expert and dedicated public servant, it’s been my honor to work with so many Montanans to balance the needs of our economy and communities with the importance of protecting our storied outdoor heritage. I’ve worked to reduce the amount of money in campaigns, cut taxes and red tape, help farmers and ranchers, and create jobs.
Maryland Matt on the other hand would rather have you ignore the facts and listen to falsehoods about me that his Super PAC donors are helping him spread. We need to set things straight and we need your $20 to make it happen. Will you donate right now?

I worked to expand access to quality healthcare. Matt Rosendale pushed junk insurance plans that don’t even cover pre-existing conditions.
The numbers don’t lie: Maryland Matt is in the business of turning his political connections into gaining more power and influence over the way Montanans live their lives.
If Maryland Matt wants to go back to the DC area, he should do it on his dime, not ours. Can I count on you to support me and my campaign today, and stop Rosendale’s march to Washington with a $20 donation?

With early voting having kicked off and absentee ballots being sent out to mailboxes in a matter of days, the election has already started.
That means we’re running out of time and resources to reach the crucial undecided voters who will make the difference in this race.
Although our race is tied, it’ll be the voices in the middle who will make it clear who they believe will serve their best interests in Congress. I’m running to represent the voice of the people -- my Republican opponent is running to represent his wealthy donors.

1. 84% of Montanans say the environment is a critically important issue to consider when supporting public officials
2. 75% of Montanans consider themselves “conservationists”
3. ⅔ of Montanans believe in preserving our public spaces, not selling them off to the highest bidder

Last Tuesday, we celebrated the 100-year anniversary of the 19th Amendment which gave many women the right to vote, and on Wednesday we will be celebrating Women’s Equality Day.
These celebrations are both important reminders of how far we as a nation have come, but that the work to achieve equality is far from over.
Women still face workplace sexual harassment, discrimination, and are paid just $0.79 for every $1 their male counterpart makes -- and that number is even lower among women of color. Even now, the Equal Rights Amendment, a landmark piece of legislation, is collecting dust on Mitch McConnell’s desk.
Let’s make our voices heard loud and clear that we want to achieve equality under the law. ADD YOUR NAME: Demand that the Senate ratify the Equal Rights Amendment.
ADD YOUR NAME
Protecting the rights of women shouldn’t be partisan. Instead, far-right extremists are simply ignoring all the ways women are treated unfairly and tuning out the calls of women to make things better.
But we can ensure that they get back to listening to the people they represent.
ADD YOUR NAME: Be one of the 5,000 supporters we need to sign on to my petition. We have to keep moving forward to make things better for all women. If you agree, add your name to my petition today.
ADD YOUR NAME
And, in this election, let’s elect Montana’s second Congresswoman to the US House!

Straight off our major win in Montana’s Democratic Primary, we just got word that our race is tightening.
Montana’s At-Large district was just named one of the most competitive in the country and moved from Likely Republican to Lean Republican by The Cook Political Report!!!
Even the political experts see Kathleen’s race tightening as we work overtime to close the gap between Kathleen and Matt Rosendale.
The GOP in Montana see the writing on the wall and know we have the greatest chance we've ever had to send real Montana leadership to Washington. But they’re going to say anything to win. Will you chip in $10 to ensure Kathleen’s November victory?

Maryland Matt Rosendale has nowhere else to turn. His dark money support can only take him so far. They’re going to lie about Kathleen’s record all summer into the fall and try to reinvent Rosendale’s because they have nothing else. Well, Montanans know and deserve better.
That’s why we’re working non-stop to get Kathleen’s message to as many people as possible. It’s going to be a challenge now that we can’t venture into the communities we love. But that won’t stop us from getting the job done.
We need you on our side to make sure Kathleen can take her seat in Congress and DEFEAT Matt Rosendale in November. Will you donate to help support our movement today?

I’ll make this quick, will you send in just $5 to help us wrap up our final, pre-primary fundraising goal? We need to raise another $457.
We still have time to get our message out to voters who may be personally dropping off their ballots, or (safely) voting in person at their election office. It’s an exciting day for democracy and our campaign.
Tonight, we can bring home a victory, but we need your support to make that happen.
Thank you so much!
Kathleen Williams

P.S. Don’t forget to vote by 8 pm! If you still have your ballot, use this link to find your precinct number and then go here to determine your drop-off location (by precinct) and make sure your voice is heard. If you don’t have a ballot, you can still register or re-register and vote in person today by 8 pm at elections offices (be safe!) if you’ve lived in Montana at least 30 days. If you have questions, please call or text 406-272-4046.

Friends,
We’re losing time to reach our final $20,000 goal before our midnight deadline.
We need to raise every cent as we fight to reach crucial voters who will help us get ahead of Maryland Matt’s dark money-funded campaign.
Because Montanans deserve a true, independent leader in Congress.
But we’re rushing to beat the clock before our fundraising totals are locked in for the month. Just $1,098 stands between us and our goal. Will you donate $10 before tonight?
Thank you so much!

Friends,
At the end of the month, Kathleen and the team will be submitting their final, end-of-quarter report before November’s General Election and we want to submit this one with a bang.
We’re looking to add $35,000 to our budget numbers before our September 30th deadline and Kathleen needs your help to make it happen. Help us kick things off early with a $30 contribution today.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50
$100 $250 Other
This one of the last times our numbers will be public for everyone to see before the General Election -- and that means the Washington Super PACs pumping up Maryland Matt’s campaign will see exactly where we stand.
That’s why we need to make sure we send in our strongest report yet. Not only that, but this is also a prime opportunity to get in the final resources we’ll need in the final weeks of the campaign as soon as we enter October.
So help Kathleen and the entire team send in a strong report that reflects the growing momentum behind their campaign. Will you make a donation of any size right now?
CHIP IN $30 HERE

Matt Rosendale has just released a new ad smearing Kathleen’s record of service in Montana just 28 days ahead of November’s General Election.
Help us respond by getting 150 Rapid Response Donations TODAY!
* * *
Unlike Maryland Matt, we don’t need to greenlight falsehoods or use smear tactics in our ads to win this campaign.
All we have to do is listen to the people of Montana.
Montanans are tired of Maryland Matt trying to turn our state into the D.C. swamp. And they’re tired of him twisting our fight for all Montanans into an attempt to paint Kathleen as a partisan extremist. It’s an old tactic that he thinks will take him to Congress, and it's just not true.
But don’t just ask us, see what the Bozeman Daily Chronicle has to say:
“Rosendale’s campaign seeks to paint Williams as a liberal who will ally herself with extreme left elements of Congress. Her record tells a different story.”
Matt Rosendale is grasping at straws because he knows distorting Kathleen’s record is his only chance to win. Help us set the record straight now that Matt Rosendale has just released his next slate of ads with a $20 donation.

It’s not every day that your former opponent spends $250,000 of his own money to bankroll your opposition. But that’s just a regular day for Greg Gianforte.
Greg Gianforte and special interest groups know that we are outraising most of our opponents in Montana. That’s why they’re asking every deep-pocketed donor to get involved and are scraping the bottom of the barrel.
Let’s make sure it stays that way.
Right now, our opponents have a lot of wiggle room with Gianforte’s newest $250,000 lifeline. We’ve got to match that strength. Can we count on our top supporters to help us keep ahead of the newest influx of cash?

Greg is happy to play the hard-working Montanan, but he doesn’t know that the hard-working Montanan doesn’t have $250,000 to burn. Instead, we work hard for every penny. Countless Montanans live paycheck to paycheck, deciding when to fill prescriptions, pay for college or even get food on the table.
That’s who Kathleen’s fighting for -- not Washington elites.
Our grassroots team is supporting Kathleen with their hard-earned money, and we couldn’t be prouder. Come join us today, by chipping in $15 right now.

Hi everyone,
I’m Cora Neumann, a former Candidate for Montana’s U.S. Senate seat, and I proudly endorse Kathleen Williams in her race to represent Montana's lone US House seat.
Before I tell you why, will you pitch in $30 to Kathleen’s campaign to send a proven leader to Congress? In just a few months, we can send her to Washington to fight for us, our communities, and our public lands. This is only possible with a strong grassroots team standing with her. Will you donate today?
Throughout my career, I have worked with and mentored women leaders -- from local health practitioners to First Ladies -- in their efforts to serve our communities. At the State Department, I worked on women's economic empowerment and leadership in the US and worldwide.
Both personally and professionally, I am committed to seeing more women’s voices at the table. It’s good for the economy, for society, and for the future of our planet.
I also know a special leader when I see one. That is why I am very proud to endorse Kathleen Williams for her run for Montana’s lone House seat.
If you’re ready to send an independent voice to Washington who will put Montana first, then it’s time to elect Kathleen Williams. Join me in endorsing Kathleen today by chipping in any amount to support her campaign.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

$50 $100

Having women in Congress means effective policies will see the light of day more often. In fact, during this COVID-19 response, we are seeing some of the most rapid, comprehensive and effective responses come from women leaders.
We need Kathleen fighting for Big Sky Country on Capitol Hill now more than ever. Join me in endorsing a clear choice for our state by chipping in $10, $27, or any amount today.
Thank you,
Cora Neumann

The current public health and economic challenges further remind us that we need strong, principled leadership in Washington. So, we are continuing to work hard, with your help, to raise the resources needed to get there.
At the end of March, we will be submitting all of our fundraising numbers for our first public report of 2020.
This next Tuesday, everything we’ve done in the past three months will be out in the open for every eye to see. Let’s make sure we send in a report that will make every person who is a part of this campaign proud.
We’re looking to boost our fundraising numbers to keep outraising our opponents. Can you give $25 today to our $20,000 March 31st end-of-quarter goal?

We’ve seen a groundswell of supporters join our campaign from Troy to Broadus and Plentywood to Darby, but we have to turn that support into donations in order to show our opponents the strength of our movement.
Please chip in your $25 today and let’s keep our momentum going. Time’s ticking, and there are only 8 days left.

Kathleen has gotten results. She’s protected care for cancer patients, fought against insurance discrimination and surprise medical bills, and helped extend coverage to over 90,000 Montanans. She already has a plan to further expand healthcare affordability and access for Montanans when she gets to Congress. No matter pre-existing conditions or income, expanding coverage and access is one of Kathleen’s top priorities.

For Kathleen, fighting for our public lands isn’t political -- it’s personal.
As a natural resource expert and former State Representative, Kathleen has spent her time managing America’s most important resources like clean water, fresh air and our valued open spaces. She understands just how critical the role public lands play in keeping Montana’s communities vibrant.

Instead of seeing our outdoors as a resource that needs proper management and care, Montana Republicans have a different vision -- they see land that’s ripe for development.
That’s why Kathleen is running to defeat our millionaire, East Coast developer opponent who’s pushed for the transfer of public lands -- all to make them easier to sell off to the highest bidder.
We need to fiercely defend Montana’s outdoor heritage for future generations. If you agree, chip in $25 to send Kathleen to Washington to ensure we conserve our public lands for future generations.

Friends,
Nurses across the country are putting their lives on the line as they battle the COVID-19 pandemic.
With National Nurses Day this week, we want to let nurses all across the country know how deeply we appreciate their work fighting on the frontlines of this public health crisis.
Will you sign our campaign’s thank you card to nurses in Montana and around the country?
Sign The Card
Even beyond our current crisis, nurses are critical to making sure our nation is healthy and cared for. These deeply committed healthcare professionals made it their responsibility to lend their services to every community.
Montanans recognize hard work and now it’s up to us to show our appreciation for nurses.
Will you add your name to Kathleen’s thank you card to help us celebrate National Nurses Day this week?
Thank you so much for your support,
Team Kathleen

Help Protect Montana’s Public Lands!
The Montana GOP is ready to sell off our public lands to the highest bidder.
Will you stand up to their plan by signing Kathleen’s petition to PROTECT our public lands?
* * *
Team,
Whether it’s Greg Gianforte who openly opposes funding key conservation legislation or Matt Rosendale, an out-of-state developer who campaigned on transferring our public lands, Montana’s GOP is drafting up plans for their next attempt to attack our public lands, tarnish Montana’s outdoor legacy and block access roads and trails from the public.
We need to make our voices heard that Montana’s public lands are NOT for sale. Add your name to our petition today calling for full funding and support for our public spaces. We’re looking to add 5,000 names to this petition -- will you be one of them?
Kathleen Williams for Congress
The current administration has a record of removing protections from vast expanses of public lands, and we need to stand up and act if we want to secure our outdoor heritage for the next generation.
It happened in Utah. It’s happening in Arizona. And unless we stay vigilant, Montana could be next on the chopping block.
We’re looking for 5,000 signatures to help strengthen our case to the GOP, industrialists and anyone looking to wreak havoc on our public lands. Will you join your voice with ours by adding your name to protect our public lands?
Thank you for taking a stand,
Team Kathleen

Special interests are hoping to see Kathleen’s campaign fail. Out-of-state interests are pouring money into this race to see a candidate allow skyrocketing health care costs, eliminate the Affordable Care Act and work for the lobbyists’ best interests.
But our grassroots campaign can show them that we’re stronger than they are. Will you help Kathleen win the opportunity to represent Montana by helping us raise the final $6,030 we need before primary voting ends on Tuesday?

Team,
When August ends, we’ll be on the final sprint to the election. At the end of September, our final fundraising report before the election will be due and we want to make a bold statement.
With attacks ads, dark-money spending, and million-dollar corporate PACs aimed right at us, we want to show the true power of the people. But there isn’t much time to do it.
That’s why we’re aiming high for August’s fundraising goal to help us bump up our numbers before we hit September. Will you help us show the power of our campaign by helping us raise $25,000 before August 31st?
CHIP IN HERE
Montana is the top prize of special interests in 2020. They see the growing people-funded movement to elect Kathleen, and they know that she won’t toe their line in Congress.
They’ve put their might behind their efforts to win and they’re depending on their dark money dollars and mega-donors to outwork and outpace our small-dollar, grassroots movement. We won’t let them stop us.
But we need to keep up the energy to finish up August as strong as possible. Will you send in $30 to help raise $25,000 before Monday’s midnight deadline?
Thank you,
Jeff Allen

Team, it’s unimaginable to think this is happening now.
Right when families need health insurance to cover costs and keep them healthy, the GOP is actively fighting to eradicate the Affordable Care Act.
But we can stop them in their tracks. Send in your donation to help me win Montana’s ONLY House seat and I’ll start fighting for American families on day ONE.
I’ve already fought tooth and nail to extend coverage to over 90,000 Montanans, and I’ll do the same in Congress. I have a record of real results in protecting care for cancer patients, fighting against insurance discrimination and surprise medical bills, and advocating for better, more affordable health care.

Politico Headline
Right now, Republican-controlled states are ganging up to jeopardize healthcare for over 20 million Americans, directly fueled by support from the current administration.
Instead of expanding coverage, their solution to the rising cost of health care? Put millions at risk of being kicked off of their insurance.
We need to elect leaders who are willing to stand up and protect coverage for millions of Americans. We need leaders like Kathleen. That’s where you come in. Will you chip in to help her get to Congress and lower costs and increase coverage? Not the other way around.

Countless American families depend on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to lower costs and prevent insurance companies from taking advantage of them and their health conditions.
But to some, eliminating the ACA means that their insurance buddies will be more than happy to fund their campaigns.
We need to stand up to bullies willing to strip coverage to line their pockets. Rush in a $10 contribution so that Kathleen Williams can stand up against them.

Despite the economic and public health challenges we're facing, you can feel a change coming. The weather is warming, snow is receding and the migratory birds are returning.
Spring is a time of change. As all things begin to emerge from winter, Montanans too have the chance to make their own choice that’ll change the path and future of our state.
Will we continue to be misrepresented in Congress by out of touch public officials looking to make a quick dollar and climb the political ladder? Or will we stand up, together, against self-serving, broken politicians?
I’m ready to actually fight for Montana’s best interests in Congress. In 2020 there’s too much on the line to elect another political climber to office. If you’re ready to spring our state into the future, please consider chipping in $20.20 right now.

I’m dedicated to making sure Kathleen Williams wins big in 2020, which is why I wanted to send you another message.
Voting in Montana is underway, meaning the General Election is happening right now. We’re running out of time to ensure that Kathleen will get the nod as our lone voice in Congress.
But Matt Rosendale is feeling the pressure. Just last week, he and his dark money allies launched TWO attack ads that lie about Kathleen’s record. The truth? She’s fighting for more affordable healthcare, tax cuts for the middle class and she’s ready to do it in a bipartisan way.
Let’s make sure Matt Rosendale doesn’t get anywhere close to Congress by chipping in $17 to Kathleen’s campaign -- $1 for every day we have left before November 3rd!

Our Montana way of life is at stake in this election. Matt Rosendale is happy to take the voices of his wealthy donors to Congress and turn our state into a playground for Washington elites and developers looking to make a quick buck off our land and our people.
But we can stop that from happening. Chip in any amount today to support Kathleen as we enter into the final days of the election.

Kathleen Williams for Congress
There’s really no two ways about it: a woman should have the freedom and privacy to make her own health care decisions without any interference -- especially from her own government.
At a time when women's rights are under attack, it’s more vital than ever that we take a stand to defend access to critical health care services.
Add your name to our petition today to tell Congress that our network is ready to defend a woman’s right to health care! There’s no “if”s, “and”s or “but”s about it.
Protect Women’s Health Care TODAY
A woman’s health care decisions should only be made between her and her doctor. In a free and just country, our government should have zero say in the decisions we make about our bodies.
But right now, that’s not the case. Scores of politicians in Washington are using health care as a political football instead of caring about the health and wellbeing of women in their own districts.
It’s time for action.
Will you add your voice with our entire team to send a clear message that we won’t stop fighting for women’s unobstructed access to critical health care services they rely on?
Thanks for making a difference

We hope you and yours are all healthy and safe. Regarding the campaign, things have changed and there’s ground we need to make up if we want to hit our fundraising projections for April. Right now we’re facing a major budget shortfall 7 days before the month ends.
Without critical support now, we’re facing the inevitable: Matt Rosendale wins and gets to lead our state in whatever direction his special interest backers tell him to.
It’s time to fight back before he hijacks the future of Montana.
We can’t fall behind in this critical point in our race. Will you be one of the 500 donors we need to chip in before April 30th?
DONATE HERE
In an era of industrializing public lands and a return to skyrocketing uninsured rates, we can’t risk handing Big Sky Country’s lone voice in the US House to Maryland Matt Rosendale. That’s why our supporters need to chip in to ensure that he will never be able to take Montana backward.
The primary is on the horizon and we need to spread the word about Kathleen.
So let’s make that happen today. Chip in to have your donation count toward our 500 donation goal.

The Administration recently removed key protections for migratory and endangered birds that experts say could result in harm to billions. The rollback quickly led to the destruction of nesting grounds for 25,000 birds in Virginia and certainly more harms since that has gone unreported.

Team, how we do on hitting our June 30th fundraising deadline is a test to see how well we’ll do on November 3rd.
With countless special interest groups throwing money behind Matt Rosendale, our end-of-quarter goal is a yardstick to see if we can outraise, outcampaign and outorganize some of the strongest forces in Washington who want to influence Montana.
I know we have what it takes. But we need to put this strength on paper for everyone to see.
That’s why our $30,000 goal is critical to the perseverance and persistence of our campaign. Will you fight to have your own voice heard and to send Kathleen to Congress in November with a $15 contribution before our June 30th deadline?
Thank you so much. Let’s finish the job,

\----FORWARDED MESSAGE----
Kathleen Williams for Congress
March is Women’s History Month, and this month we get to celebrate the diversity and importance of Montana women.
From Jeannette Rankin to Pretty Shield, Montana women have never backed down from a challenge. Instead, they’re trailblazers who’ve sacrificed to build a better future. Now it’s our turn.
That’s why we need to tell Congress to finalize the call to end gender discrimination. Will you be one of my 200 top supporters to sign on to my newest petition today?
ADD YOUR NAME WITH MINE
When the Equal Rights Amendment was introduced over a century ago, it was seen as radical that women were deciding the future they wanted. But they weren’t fazed and they have carried the fight for equality up to today. And we should be proud that Montana was an early leader, approving the amendment in 1974.
We still have work to do. Congress can’t ignore 200 voices joining together. Add your name to my newest petition and tell Congress we won’t stand for gender discrimination!
Thank you,
Kathleen Williams

53% of Americans believe that our government is facing a corruption crisis. And that’s on top of the 87% of voters who believe corruption is widespread on a federal level.
No matter our political stripes, gender, or race, Americans believe that politicians let corruption run unchecked throughout every branch of our government. That’s why we need real leaders like Kathleen fighting for us in Congress.
We need principled, independent leaders like Kathleen to spend their time in Congress fighting for Montana’s best interests, not special interests. Will you send in $10 today to help her win in November?

Montana has personal experience of what happens when corruptible leaders have power. Whether its misuse of state property, $250,000 donations to meddle in elections or advocating the transfer of public lands.
Montanans are saying enough is enough.
Let’s lead the nation by example. Help us send in an independent, corruption-fighting leader -- Kathleen Williams -- to represent Montanan values by donating today.
Thank you,

NBC headline
Here’s what’s happening in Montana.
The issue: Club for Growth, an extremist and pro-Trump Super PAC, broke campaign finance laws in order to divide Democratic Montana voters and influence our elections. They've already bought $400,000 worth of advertising this fall.
Why this matters: The penalties they’ll face are a slap on the wrist and won’t stand in the way of their plans to spend millions of dollars to uplift out of touch Republicans -- including Matt Rosendale.
How you make the difference: We’re looking for 500 donors who are willing to stand up to dark special interests and send a message that Montanans are tired of extremism and dirty tricks. Will you chip in today to help boost Kathleen’s campaign in the face of our next big challenge?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50
$100 $250 Other
Matt Rosendale will use every opportunity to his advantage, and so will his special interest backers who would love nothing more than to preserve the status quo that serves them.
We’re proud to be funded by hardworking, small-dollar donors like you. But that means we have to work twice as hard to keep up with Rosendale’s dark-money funded campaign. Chip in $15 before Wednesday’s midnight deadline.
Thank you for your support,

Please be safe and follow CDC guidance during the coronavirus outbreak. As our country works through this difficult time, please join me in reaching out to those in need or who are feeling isolated - we are all in this together.
Friends,
Last week, our race was officially added to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s Red to Blue list, meaning we’re now one of the TOP races in the entire country.
But for us, this means more than changing the colors of the district. This is about sending to Congress a true, independent leader for Montana who listens to the people and gets the job done.
Because for too long, Montanans have had representatives more interested in taking cues from their special interest backers than serving the people.
But in November, we will change that. Kathleen is ready to be the people’s champion in Congress, but we’re up against Matt Rosendale’s mountain of cash. Will you join the 150 donors we’re looking for today, to help level the playing field before the election?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25
$50 $100

The differences in this election could not be more stark. Instead of expanding health care coverage, Rosendale wants to strip it away.
Rosendale proposed transferring our public lands, instead of protecting our state’s proud outdoor heritage.
This is about more than flipping a district. It’s about sending a real leader to fight for Montanans in Congress. Will you chip in to Kathleen’s campaign today to help her be the independent leader we need in 2020?
Thank you,

Team,
We only have a few more hours to reach our final, end-of-month goal for July. But we still need a few more donations to help us reach the last $526 we need.
Will you chip in just $5 tonight to help us raise the final resources we need to win it all in November?
Thank you for your continued support,

Everyone is watching our performance to see how much of a threat our campaign will be. Matt Rosendale’s special-interest backers are hoping our momentum will be crushed even before the last ballot is dropped.
I hope we can count on you to vote for Kathleen so that after the primary, we can make sure her independent, no-nonsense leadership gets to Congress to deliver the results we deserve.
Together, we’ll make Washington work for Montana, but we have to make it to the General Election first. Help us raise the last $6,870 we need to make our $15,000 goal.
Thank you,

Please be safe and follow CDC guidance during the coronavirus outbreak. As our country works through this difficult time, please join me in reaching out to those in need or who are feeling isolated - we are all in this together.
Hi,
I’m Matt Rains, former Democratic candidate for Congress -- the same seat Kathleen Williams is running for.
I’m writing because, although we ran against each other for six months, I endorse Kathleen wholeheartedly to be our next Congresswoman from Montana. She truly will dedicate her life and efforts to working for all of us.
I’m going to tell you why in just a minute, but first, will you pitch in $20 to Kathleen’s campaign? She’s hands-down the best person to be Montana’s voice in Congress. But she needs the resources and support to win this campaign. Will you help out?
My family has lived in Montana and operated the Birdtail Ranch in Simms for five generations. I’m a proud West Point graduate, Blackhawk helicopter pilot, and Iraq War veteran. I deeply cherish the heritage of what my ancestors created and appreciate my responsibility to carry that hard-work forward. On the campaign trail with Kathleen, I saw firsthand how committed she is to protecting the Montana we both proudly call home.
I trust Kathleen to stand up for farmers and ranchers because she spent a large part of her career working across the west to keep folks on the land and bring new generations back to farming and ranching. I trust Kathleen to fight for my fellow veterans because her father was a World War II veteran and her husband served during Vietnam, later volunteering to put himself in harm's way as a civilian advisor in Iraq.
What I love most about Kathleen is that she isn’t afraid to tell you what she thinks even if she knows you might disagree. Yet she can find the common ground between sides. We need her kind of honesty, independence and courage. These are the values that make Montana special.
If you’re like me, you’ve had enough of the nonsense in Congress from our current Representative. We can’t afford more of the same with Matt Rosendale. Join me in endorsing Kathleen by chipping in any amount now.
Despite the fact that we ran against each other, there’s no doubt in my mind that Kathleen will be our champion in DC and finally give us a representative we can be proud of. I hope you’ll join me in voting for her in the June 2nd primary and in November.
Thank you,
Matt Rains
Former Candidate for Montana’s U.S. House Seat;

\------FORWARDED MESSAGE------
Kathleen Williams for Congress
There’s a lot of lies being spread about me and my record, so I wanted to tell you why I'm fighting to get to Congress.
As a natural resource expert and dedicated public servant, it’s been my honor to work with so many Montanans to balance the needs of our economy and communities with the importance of protecting our storied outdoor heritage. I’ve worked to reduce the amount of money in campaigns, cut taxes and red tape, help farmers and ranchers, and create jobs.
Maryland Matt on the other hand would rather have you ignore the facts and listen to falsehoods about me that his Super PAC donors are helping him spread. We need to set things straight and we need your $20 to make it happen. Will you donate right now?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50
$100 $250 Other
I worked to expand access to quality healthcare. Matt Rosendale pushed junk insurance plans that don’t even cover pre-existing conditions.
The numbers don’t lie: Maryland Matt is in the business of turning his political connections into gaining more power and influence over the way Montanans live their lives.
If Maryland Matt wants to go back to the DC area, he should do it on his dime, not ours. Can I count on you to support me and my campaign today, and stop Rosendale’s march to Washington with a $20 donation?
Thank you,
Kathleen Williams

We have to keep our public lands out of the hands of profiteers!
Montana Republicans have already spent their time trying to block access to the public spaces we love. Just imagine what they'll do if Maryland Matt’s elected.
If you want to protect Montana’s legacy, sign HERE to add your name to DEMAND our public lands stay in public hands.
ADD MY NAME
* * *
A staple of our amazing state has been our dedication to proper public land management. 90% of Montanans believe that public lands have a positive impact on our waters, our wildlife and our way of life.
That’s why we need to make our voices heard that NONE of our public lands are up for sale. SIGN HERE to add your name to Kathleen’s petition ensuring that our favorite spaces will stay public.
STAND WITH KATHLEEN
This isn’t a partisan issue. People of all political stripes agree that Montana would be a fundamentally different place without our emphasis on keeping our water clean and our outdoors accessible.
Out-of-touch ideologues like Maryland Matt want you to think otherwise. That way, they can control critical access roads, create their own hunting grounds, and tell us how our public lands will be managed. All to make their donors happy.
We need 5,000 signatures to help make it clear: public lands are safe in Montana. Join Kathleen as she fights to protect the spaces we hold dear. Sign on today.
Thank you,

We’re not letting him have the airwaves to himself. We’re launching another brand new TV ad! We just need a new bump in fundraising to help us get it in front of as many voters as possible.

Friends, I’m proud of what I’ve been able to accomplish for Montana and I’m excited to keep up my decades of fighting for the first place that ever felt like home for me.
While Maryland Matt uses his connections to put his interests first and climb the political ladder, I’ve spent my time managing our resources and fighting for our neighbors and communities in the Montana State House.
Now, he’s sending his special interest funders to do whatever dirty work they need to help him secure this election in November.

Right now, I’m calling on Kathleen’s top-supporters to help reach her critical, FINAL end-of-quarter public goal. Will you contribute $20 to help her reach her $35,000 goal?
Kathleen is right in the middle of the most critical fundraising period of this entire campaign. By the end of the month, national groups will get their final look at her fundraising numbers.
And she’s in a dead heat in the race for Montana’s only seat in the House. Montanans can’t stand by as a Super PAC-funded, East Coast Developer overtakes her in the polls.
Will you help ensure she’s competitive by rushing in a donation of any size?

I’m fighting in my own race right now and I can tell you that Montana is a top prize for the big special interests in 2020. Every race, from the Senate to the Governorship will be won by razor-thin margins.
I know Kathleen is the voice of leadership that Montanans deserve. Now it’s our time to do our part to get her to Washington.
We have to keep our foot on the gas. Help keep the momentum going for Team Kathleen by giving $27, $18 or $9 right now.

With six months until the election, we have to do everything we can to keep hitting goals, and with you on this team, I’m confident we’ll continue to do that.
I want to keep up to date with the issues hardworking Montanans face. With the public health crisis shaping what we do every day, taking our new updated issue survey keeps us in tune with the people we’re fighting for.
Please take one minute of your time today to take our issue survey. This is the most direct way we can stay in touch with the voters.

Hi everyone,
I spent 30 years in public service fighting to protect people here in Montana and across the country. My husband, Max, was Montana’s longest-serving U.S. Senator. I’ve seen firsthand just how much leadership matters, and that’s why I’m proud to endorse Kathleen Williams for Congress.
Kathleen and Mel Hanes
Kathleen’s supporters have always come through, and now she needs your help again. Can you pitch in $20 right now to make sure Kathleen has the resources to take on and defeat Matt Rosendale this November?
Montanans deserve a strong voice in our lone seat in the U.S. House -- one that will put Montanans first, not a politician’s own personal interests. Kathleen spent her career protecting lands across the West, protecting healthcare for cancer patients and helping to create over 200 new businesses in Montana. Kathleen won't take a dime from corporate PACs. She'll represent our best interests, and that’s the kind of leadership Montana deserves.
This is a pivotal moment in our country’s history. With so much uncertainty, we have the chance to send an independent voice to Washington to fight for us. She’ll leave politics behind and work with everyone to do what’s right for Montana.
We can send Montana’s next Congresswoman to Washington, but she’ll need your help. Join me in endorsing Kathleen Williams and pitch in $10 now to help her finish the job she started in 2018.
Thank you,
Mel Hanes
P.S. Don’t forget to vote for Kathleen for Congress in the June 2nd Primary Election, and again in November!

With two new rating changes coming out last week, the message is clear: we are in a strong place to win in November and BLOCK Matt Rosendale from reaching Congress this election.
But polling wise, this race is still a dead heat, and unless we start reaching undecided voters, we may fall short. In these final days, it’s now or never.
That’s why we need to raise the last $2,786 in our Ad Buy Fund before we miss our prime opportunity to tilt this race toward our campaign. I need you to rush in $10 right now, before our deadline in just over 24 hours!

Reaching every community in Montana is tough, but it has been my mission since day one. Both our cities and rural communities deserve to have their voices heard.
But we’re running out of time to make any substantial purchases that reach the number of people we need. We can’t waste critical time, especially when voters already have ballots in their hands.
We need to close our gap and get our ads on television, the internet and in front of voters now so they can be fully informed on their decision. Chip in $15 before tomorrow to make this happen.

May is Mental Health Awareness Month. Kathleen knows many struggle with mental health issues every day and has worked to advance services in her community and beyond. As we isolate, even more are realizing the importance of the availability of mental health services.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many organizations dedicated to providing these services are facing the greatest challenge. Although some are providing telehealth services, they can’t open their doors and their patients are losing critical in-person care services.
We can’t keep this up forever.
It’s up to us to ensure that mental and behavioral health services organizations do not become yet another casualty of this global public health crisis. Will you add your name today to pledge your support for mental health, not just this month but every month?
Mental health is just as important as our physical health and there’s no way we can have a healthy, robust society without mental and physical care services working together.
Look at the facts:
* 56% of Americans say that the worry and stress from the coronavirus pandemic has had a negative effect on their mental health
* Organizations that help treat mental health or substance abuse services are at the greatest risk of shuttering their doors
* The number of people struggling with mental illness continues to grow as economic and emotional issues challenge families’ well-being
It’s time to make sure that mental health is a priority in this country. Stand with Kathleen today and DEMAND we do so.
Thank you,
Team Kathleen

So far 456 people have chipped in to stand up to partisan gamesmanship from a pro-Trump Super PAC-backed candidate, Matt Rosendale.
456 people have made their voices heard -- they’re tired of failed leadership that puts insurance profits and Washington special interests over the people.
456 people know that Montana deserves independent leadership that won’t bow to the biggest donors.
Now, a brand new poll has me and Matt Rosendale TIED in a dead heat at 47%-47%! I know momentum is on our side but right now the race is just too close to call!
Will you help me break through the tie? I’m ready to be the true, independent leader that Montanans deserve and make history in November, but I need you to join the 456 people fighting to make that happen. Will you be one of the last 44 people we need to help us reach our midnight fundraising goal?

Summer is an extremely busy time for our campaign, and we need every penny we can bring in to help build the foundation that will help us DEFEAT Matt Rosendale.
We’re preparing to do all we can to reach the voters we need to win in November. From TV to radio ads to hitting the road (responsibly), we’re going to make sure Kathleen’s message is heard loud and clear.
That makes Matt Rosendale and his lackeys nervous. And they should be -- we’re making sure we send real Montana leadership to Washington by electing Kathleen.

It’s been an exciting few months for this campaign. Together, we’ve been able to contact thousands of Montana voters, WON the Montana Democratic Primary and have worked tirelessly to counter our opponent’s massive amounts of special interest dollars.
But this campaign can only be successful if we have everyone on board.

This has been a whirlwind of a year for Kathleen and the team, and we wanted to update you on how far we’ve come since we launched our campaign last year.
But we’re not hitting the brakes just yet. We need to continue to keep up our historic momentum all the way until November 3rd. Your $10 donation helps us keep the entire campaign running at full speed. Will you chip in right now?

Here’s where 2020 has taken us so far:
1. Since March, we’ve been tied with our Trump-endorsed, Republican opponent Matt Rosendale 47-47. This is anybody’s race to win -- and to lose.
2. We SWEPT the Montana Democratic Primaries this June, taking in 89.5% of the vote. This was an astounding message that our supporters are ready to fight all the way to November.
3. Our race was added to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s Red to Blue list because they believe we’re one of the BEST pickup opportunities in the country.
And those are just some of the many moments that have shifted and changed this race. We’re not done fighting yet, and with the summer being our busiest season yet, what we do now will determine whether we’re successful on election night.
That’s why it’s all hands on deck at Team Kathleen. If you’re ready to jump into the race and help elect Kathleen, rush in $10, or $30, right now. It’s supporters like you who will help bring us a historic victory this November.
Thank you,

We’re facing our first major challenge since winning Montana’s Democratic Primary. In just over a week, we have to send our public fundraising report to the FEC -- where all eyes will be laser-focused on how strong our campaign is.
We can’t show any signs of weakness when national Republican special interests comb through reports trying to decide where to invest their dark money.
That’s why we’re looking for our groups of small-dollar donors to help our campaign submit the strongest report possible. We need to raise $30,000 before June 30th’s midnight deadline. Can you chip in today?

There’s no way to sugarcoat this, all eyes are on our campaign and there’s a slew of Republican dollars waiting to see if our campaign shows any weakness.
Maryland Matt may have his special interest donors, but we’re proud to roll up our sleeves, get to work and ask our hardworking supporters to join us in the sprint to the finish line.
We only have 8 days until our June 30th deadline. Can you chip in $30 now?
Thank you,

Right now, our country is facing a healthcare crisis. What makes that even worse? Soaring prescription drug prices.
When it’s cheaper to get prescription drugs from Canada, you know we have a problem. There’s no good reason why the richest country in the world is forcing people to choose between filling their prescriptions and keeping the lights on.
But that’s the reality for countless Montanans. We need action. We need 5,000 of Kathleen’s grassroots team to sign her newest petition: Demand the Senate take action to lower prescription drug costs.
Critical drugs to manage diabetes, address heart disease, and shrink tumors all continue to have skyrocketing costs. Some even cost over $20,000 for one month’s supply.
There’s no more room to just sit by. Sick Montanans need advocates and it’s up to us to ensure their voices are heard by raising ours.
Stand with Montanans today. Add your name to Kathleen’s petition. Let’s lower prescription drug prices together.
SIGN HERE
Thank you,

We’re officially 49 days away from Election Day on November 3rd. We’re excited, but we have new challenges facing our campaign.
We’re building voter outreach programs, reconfiguring our field plan and making sure Montanans have a plan to vote -- either in person or through the mail.
All the while our race continues to be bombarded by national far-right groups and deep-pocketed special interests trying to drag Kathleen’s name through the mud.
That’s why we need to set our goals high and hit every one of them. So, before our fundraising numbers go public at the end of the month for the world to see, will you help me and the team raise $10,000 before Thursday?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50
$100 $250 Other
Just days ago a far-right Super PAC dumped millions of dollars into this race to preserve the status quo that puts Wall Street over Main Street.
But with this initial $10,000 goal, you can help build out our plans all the way to Election Day so that we can change that.
So help us hit our first major goal of the month. Chip in $5 right now.
Thank you,
Blake Thompson

Just look at what we’ve been able to accomplish since we started our final, end-of-month fundraising push for August.

We’ve made a major dent into our $30,000 goal, but we still need a final push to help us get past the finish line. Will you chip in $10 right now to help grow some more green on our tracking sheet?

The final deadline to file for Montana’s at-large seat is tomorrow.
Our most likely opponent, Matt Rosendale, officially filed to run along with four other Republicans throughout the state to try and replace our current Congressman Greg Gianforte.
Will you pitch in $10, $20 or even $30 to guarantee that no matter who our opponent is, we send a champion like Kathleen to the U.S. House where she’ll bring a much-needed dose of Montana values to Congress?

We can’t afford to send another opportunistic politician to Washington. Knowing Matt Rosendale, he’s sure to continue voting against our veterans, making health care less affordable and threatening our public lands.
Kathleen’s ready to fearlessly take on special interests and self-serving, broken politicians like Rosendale. She'll work across the aisle with people of all political stripes to get things done on the big issues.
Pitch in anything you can to Kathleen’s campaign today, and let’s get to work bringing trustworthiness and independence back to a broken Congress!
Best wishes,

Hi everyone,
This Mother's Day, I want to thank the wonderful young men who allowed me to be a Mother - Calen and Sander. I became their stepmom when they were teens, and I'm so honored they welcomed me into what has become an incredible extended family.
I'm so proud of them both - talented, smart, loving, and honorable, just like their dad.
Best wishes to all moms (and stepmoms) on your day for joy, love, and celebration of family.

First: This Administration removed protections in two National Monuments in Utah: Bears Ears and Grand Escalante.
Now: They are threatening Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in Arizona with the Border Wall.
To make matters worse: With Gianforte leaving office to reach for the next rung of the political ladder, we can’t afford to have Matt Rosendale in office, who said he would make a priority of transferring public lands.
Luckily, we have a champion like Kathleen on our side who has demonstrated time after time that she’s more than ready to put a stop to threats to our public lands.

We’re making our last ad purchases before the election and it’s up to us to secure as much airtime as we possibly can in order to reach every voter across Montana.
For months, our opponent has had the support of numerous special interest groups spreading his message through ads they fronted the cash for. And in the process, they jacked up the prices for the rest of us.
But now this is our time to take back the airwaves and get Kathleen’s message out BEFORE mail voting starts tomorrow!

Friends,
Today is the last day of our end-of-quarter fundraising drive. Every dollar, dime and cent we get before midnight tonight will count towards our goal.
But after midnight, our numbers are LOCKED in.
That’s why we need your help to raise the last $4,400 we need in order to make it past this goal. Will you give whatever you can to help us beat the impossible?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50
$100 $250 Other
We will make history on November 3rd. But to do what the establishment thinks is “impossible”, we need to step up our game.
Our supporters are ready to get rid of outdated, out-of-touch leadership in Montana. But unless we hit our goal, we’re risking handing the election to Matt Rosendale. Will you stop this from happening with a $5 contribution?
Thank you,
Team Kathleen

It’s crucial we counter the false narrative that Maryland Matt and the dark-money Super PACs are spreading across Big Sky Country while dragging Kathleen’s hard-fought accomplishments through the mud.
We need as many grassroots supporters as possible to help us spread our message of principled, independent leadership for Montana.
Chip in $30 today to help us air Kathleen’s ad as broadly as possible and stop Maryland Matt Rosendale from drowning out our crucial message for Montana!

Please be safe and follow CDC guidance during the coronavirus outbreak. As our country works through this difficult time, please join me in reaching out to those in need or who are feeling isolated - we are all in this together.
Right now, Kathleen is standing strong against her dark money funded, Republican opponent. They are TIED for Montana’s only House seat.
With polling showing voters split 45 - 45, it’s anybody’s race.
That’s why we need you to help make the difference. Will you help us push past the deadlock with a $20.20 donation?
Kathleen Williams for Congress
We’re closer than ever to electing a leader dedicated to improving the lives of hardworking Montanans -- not the bottom line of rich donors. Kathleen is and will be a leader for the people.
In 2020, Montanans will kick out self-serving, out of touch politicians like Matt Rosendale, and send in real Montana leaders who can get the job done.
But we can’t do it by being complacent while the race is in a DEAD HEAT.
We need to give it our all to pull ahead before it’s too late. The Montana GOP are likely calling every donor they have to inject millions into this race. Will you stand up to their efforts with a $10 contribution right now?

Kathleen Williams for Congress
It’s Steve Bullock. I wanted to send you a quick note about why Kathleen is depending on your support this November.
We’re now 26 days away from the General Election and the choice for Montanans is clear: Kathleen Williams is the only candidate fighting for our best interests. Just take a peek at Matt Rosendale’s record:
1. As Insurance Commissioner, he has pushed healthcare plans that don't cover preexisting conditions.
2. He supported backdoor legislation to make it easier to transfer and sell off public lands.
3. And he continues to be a party puppet ready to slash taxes for the wealthy and gut Social Security.
It’s clear as day: Matt Rosendale will always put his party over the people of Montana. It’s time for Montanans to have a leader they can depend on in Congress. Will you rush in $20.20 to help support Kathleen Williams today?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50
$100 $250 Other
This election will determine Montana’s future for decades to come. We can either have a champion for our public lands and bipartisan leader as our voice into the future, or an East Coast developer looking to make a quick buck off his latest political position.
The choice is up to you. Help make sure Kathleen has her best shot at victory before we hit the final days of the election by chipping in any amount today.
Thank you,

All of this is because of the hard work, dedication and resources you and our entire generous community of supporters have put in since day one of this campaign. THANK YOU, from me and my team.
I can’t wait to bring true, independent representation for Montana to Congress, and we look forward to continuing to hear from Montanans about their hopes, struggles, and dreams on the path to victory in November.
This election may be one of the most important in our lifetimes. We have the opportunity to put the people of Montana first - not special interests or partisanship.
But the job isn’t done yet. We have to work even harder to win again in November.

According to Sabato’s Crystal Ball polling out of the University of Virginia, our race has changed from Likely Republican to Leans Republican.
This is the SECOND rating change showing us with the momentum in one of the most competitive races in the country. The writing is on the wall: we have a great shot at winning this election, but we can't let up now!

Kathleen Williams for Congress
Happy World Wildlife Day! Today we celebrate all life on earth as the fight continues to preserve the beauty that our country and Montana hold.
Montanans know how important wildlife is to our everyday lives. Whether we’re out hunting and fishing sustainably or if we’re working alongside our favorite four-legged pals, we depend on animals.
But in the face of fewer protections for endangered species, they need us now more than ever.
Will you be one of Kathleen’s top supporters willing to add your name to her newest petition calling on Congress to fully reinstate the Endangered Species Act?
In August, our government continued to ignore its responsibility to fight climate change and rolled back key protections in the Endangered Species Act -- the bill that saved the bald eagle, the grizzly bear and the American alligator.
What did we get instead? A clear path for super-polluters and big oil to develop their spaces without consideration of the local wildlife.
We need 1000 signatures to add to Kathleen’s petition to call attention and force our Congress to act. Are you with her?
Thank you,
Team Kathleen

Friends,
Kathleen is an exciting force in Montana politics and I know that she’ll make history when she wins in November.
But that’s not stopping far-right extremists from meddling in her race. They’re afraid of a dedicated public servant because they know she can flip Montana’s House seat. So they’re launching every attack they can to try and slow her momentum.
We’re not going to let D.C. special interests use Montana as their partisan playground. We need to make our voices heard by beating Kathleen’s fundraising goal. But we’re still over $20,000 away from hitting it. Will you chip in $25 right now to help get us there?

Just like me, Kathleen has already served our state proudly in the Montana State House. And just like me, she’s a dedicated public servant whose work has fostered small business growth, championed our public education and protected our outdoor heritage.
Kathleen is the perfect fit for Montana in the U.S. House and will serve our best interests. But we have to make sure she has the resources it’ll take to win. Can I count on you to donate to Kathleen’s campaign before August ends?
Thank you,
Mike Cooney
Lt. Governor of Montana, Candidate for Governor of Montana

This is breaking news!
Trump just sent out an email for Maryland Matt Rosendale attacking Kathleen and her record with just 14 days until Election Day.
“Matt Rosendale’s radical opponent, Kathleen Williams is telling lies to trick Montana voters, but I know you see right through her.” - Donald J. Trump
We all know Matt is the one who has lied throughout this campaign. Will you help us counter EVERY cent Trump is raising for Maryland Matt by helping us get 300 Rapid Response Donations TODAY? Rush in a $25 contribution right now.

Maryland Matt will be a rubber stamp in Trump’s collection because Matt just wants to climb the political ladder. Montana deserves a representative who will serve Montana first, not their own political ambitions. That person is Kathleen.
Rush in an urgently needed $20 contribution to cancel out all the money Trump is raising in order to beat Kathleen on November 3rd.

We knew that this was going to be a competitive race when Kathleen announced her candidacy to run in a district that Trump won by 21 points in 2016. Today, we have a new poll to prove just how competitive this race is.
The survey from a national polling firm shows Kathleen is statistically TIED with her likely opponent Matt Rosendale here in Montana. Now is the time to keep building momentum and prove that Kathleen will take the lead and win in November.
Will you be one of the 1,500 donors we need to chip in over the next 24 hours to send a clear message that Montana is ready for real Montanan values?
In 2018, Kathleen came the closest in over 20 years to unseating an incumbent in Montana's lone US House seat. Now the numbers are on our side. But we need your help to take the lead.
It’s a serious goal, but we can win in 2020 if we can raise the resources it takes to surpass the dark money special interests working hard to tip the scales.

Protecting our public lands is not only critical in fighting to protect our environment, it’s how we save our favorite spaces for generations to come.
Montanans are proud hunters, anglers and outdoor recreationists -- myself included. In Congress, we need life-long champions for our outdoor heritage, like myself, not those who seek to profit from it.
But the GOP is ready to sell off our public spaces to the highest bidder. That’s why we need them to hear us loud and clear: we won’t let you put our public lands in jeopardy!

Help Protect Montana’s Public Lands!
The Montana GOP is ready to sell off our public lands to the highest bidder.
Will you stand up to their plan by signing Kathleen’s petition to PROTECT our public lands?
* * *
Team,
Whether it’s Greg Gianforte who openly opposes funding key conservation legislation or Matt Rosendale, an out-of-state developer who campaigned on transferring our public lands, Montana’s GOP is drafting up plans for their next attempt to attack our public lands, tarnish Montana’s outdoor legacy and block access roads and trails from the public.
We need to make our voices heard that Montana’s public lands are NOT for sale. Add your name to our petition today calling for full funding and support for our public spaces. We’re looking to add 5,000 names to this petition -- will you be one of them?
Kathleen Williams for Congress
The current administration has a record of removing protections from vast expanses of public lands, and we need to stand up and act if we want to secure our outdoor heritage for the next generation.
It happened in Utah. It’s happening in Arizona. And unless we stay vigilant, Montana could be next on the chopping block.
We’re looking for 5,000 signatures to help strengthen our case to the GOP, industrialists and anyone looking to wreak havoc on our public lands. Will you join your voice with ours by adding your name to protect our public lands?
Thank you for taking a stand,
Team Kathleen

Team,
Our friends over at [[URL REDACTED]] have compiled an entire website that showcases just how out-of-touch and baseless Maryland Matt Rosendale is when it comes to the needs of Montanans.
Instead of fighting for the best interests of our state, we know that he’s only working to climb the political ladder and shake hands with big wigs in Washington. But that’s not where it ends. Maryland Matt:
* Claims to have “expanded access to health care” but voted against extending health care coverage to over 90,000 Montanans.
* Took vast amounts of money from the insurance industry and opposed laws that protect people with pre-existing conditions.
* Is proud to be on the record supporting the transfer of federal public lands to the state -- opening the door to possible sales.
* Supported raising the retirement age for Social Security and argued Medicare benefits would “bankrupt” our healthcare.
We need a real leader dedicated to the health, well being and safety of all Montanans -- not his multi-millionaire friends. That’s why we’re sending Kathleen to Congress and you help us make it happen at every step. Will you give $15 to support her campaign today?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Friends, I will make this as quick as possible -- can Kathleen count on you to give $25 to help her reach the last $7,289 she needs for her $35,000 end-of-quarter goal?
Kathleen knows what it takes to lead. As a state legislator, she worked to ensure that public dollars go to public schools, mom and pop shops stay open and Montana’s public lands stay in public hands. She also supports efforts to protect voting rights for Montanans.
But more than anything, she knows that good leadership has no party -- that’s why she’s ready to work across the aisle to get things done in Washington. On the other hand, Matt Rosendale can’t be bothered to even do his job.
Will you help Kathleen have the best chance possible to take her seat in Congress today with your $25 contribution to her campaign before her midnight deadline on September 30th?

Team,
Happy Labor Day! Today we go beyond celebrating a day off or the end of summer. We celebrate the hard work Americans have done to build the country we love.
Our country was built on the work of union members, factory workers, farmworkers, ranch hands and all those who clock in and get the job done.
Back then, their work was highly appreciated, but today party politicians have catered to big money at the expense of workers. They have attacked collective bargaining rights and made it harder for working families to put food on the table.
That’s why I’m running for Congress -- to keep making progress for all working families in Montana, and you can help me make this possible.
Please ensure you and your family and friends are registered to vote so our workers, families, and local businesses win this time -- not the DC special interests.
Thank you and Happy Labor Day,
Kathleen Williams

I know it’s also why Kathleen Williams is running. Kathleen is committed to upholding the values that define a better Montana and a better America that we are all fighting for every day. But, friends, winning this battle for the soul of America will take all of us, and I’m counting on you to do your part.

CONTRIBUTE
I am running for President because we are better than this.
We are better than the tax cuts to the rich that came at the expense of working families who deserve a fair shot.
We are better than the millions of lost jobs that came in the face of blatant refusal to acknowledge the depths of the crisis this pandemic has put us in.
And we are better than the hatred, racism and division that define this current administration.
Kathleen will continue to wage these important battles in the halls of Congress as well as issues like expanding access to affordable health care, ensuring our economy works for working people, and renewing our commitment to the centuries-long struggle for civil rights in this country.
But Kathleen can only win her race with your support. We are up against a tough fundraising deadline in the 37 days before Election Day, and I’m personally asking you to chip in to power her campaign through the finish line.

Kathleen Williams for Congress
It’s clear that Kathleen has the support and momentum to bring home a victory in November, but with national attention on our race, we can’t take anything for granted.
Our opponent outraised us, has the support of a shady dark money group and has been endorsed by Donald Trump, so we’ll need to seriously ramp up our efforts across the board in order to keep up.
Let’s prove that Kathleen has what it takes to go the distance and win. Pitch in right away to help us raise the last $2,345 we need before midnight on Saturday!
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50 $100 Other
All eyes are on Montana this November, which means that we can’t afford to show any sign of slowing down.
From public lands to affordable health care, there’s a lot on the line in this race, and that’s exactly why we need a proven leader like Kathleen to win.
Can you rush in a donation of any amount right away?

Folks,
We’re working around the clock to ensure we meet tomorrow’s fundraising goal in the face of a far-right Super PACs’ growing support for Matt Rosendale.
We know that we can out-organize and out-campaign anyone, and we can send a real leader for Montana back to Congress. But all that work we have to do depends on every single cent we can get through the door.
That’s why we’re pushing hard to meet our next fundraising challenge. Join in by helping us make it to 500 donors before tomorrow’s midnight deadline. We still need 231 people to step up!
Thank you,

NBC headline
Here’s what’s happening in Montana and all across the country right now.
The issue: Club for Growth, an extremist and pro-Trump Super PAC, broke campaign finance laws in order to divide Democratic Montana voters and influence our elections.
Why this matters: The penalties they’ll face are a slap on the wrist and won’t stand in the way of their plans to spend millions of dollars to uplift out of touch Republicans -- including Matt Rosendale.
How you make the difference: We’re looking for 500 donors who are willing to stand up to dark special interests and send a message that Montanans are tired of extremism and dirty tricks. Will you chip in today to help boost Kathleen’s campaign in the face of our next big challenge?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

$100 $250 Other
Matt Rosendale will use every opportunity to his advantage, and so will his special-interest backers who would love nothing more than to preserve the status quo that serves them.
We’re proud to be funded by hardworking, small-dollar donors like you. But that means we have to work twice as hard to keep up with Rosendale’s dark-money funded campaign. Chip in $15 before Wednesday’s midnight deadline.
Thank you for your support,
Team Kathleen

This is downright corrupt:
This is what happens when we let corrupt public officials lead. Instead of finding solutions to the worst pandemic in decades, four senators sold off millions of dollars worth of stock to benefit their own personal fortunes.
Will you add your name to our team's pledge to send real and authentic leadership like Kathleen’s to Congress?
ADD YOUR NAME
This is exactly the kind of lack of ethics Kathleen has stood against since Day 1.
No matter what branch of government, it’s up to us to elect public officials dedicated to ending corruption everywhere. That’s why we need to send a clear message that we stand for public service, not profiteering.
Kathleen’s independent and honest voice is what we need fighting for Montanans. She’ll put our best interests first, not her pocketbook.
We need Kathleen’s leadership on Capitol Hill now. If you’re ready to elect a corruption busting, resource-saving representative, add your name to our pledge to send Kathleen to Congress!
Thank you,

Friends,
Ever wondered who’s backing our Republican opponent Matt Rosendale’s campaign? Well, take a look:
Cash on Hand: $878,291
1. $12,000+ through House Freedom Fund (The Tea Party)
2. $14,000+ through Club for Growth PAC (the same organization that tried to get the Green Party on the ballot to influence Montana’s elections)
3. $2,000+ from Jim Jordan for Congress (Ohio Representative and founder of the Freedom Caucus)
4. Percent of small-dollar donors supporting his campaign: 9%
Matt Rosendale has a campaign fueled by National Republican groups and special interests ready to spend whatever they need to keep their status quo. Will you fight to offset their donations by helping us raise $3,000 today? Donate whatever you can to help.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50 $100 Other
This campaign is proud to be backed by small-dollar donors who believe in Kathleen’s vision for a true, independent voice in Congress for all Montanans.
But that also puts us at a disadvantage. All Matt Rosendale has to do is call a few friends in Republican leadership and they can send in a flood of money to run new ads, order supplies and support his voter outreach efforts.
We’re proud to be supported by you, but that means we have to work twice as hard to reach every single goal we set for this campaign. Will you lighten the load by giving $10 right now?
Thank you,

Team,
The difference between Kathleen and our Republican opponent Maryland Matt Rosendale couldn’t be more different.
Kathleen: Is running to be a true, independent voice in Congress and to work across the aisle to solve the big issues.
Maryland Matt: Is fighting to reach the next rung of the political ladder and toe the national GOP’s line.
Kathleen: Spent much of her life fighting to protect what makes Montana special.
Maryland Matt: Spent his time attacking our public lands and outdoor heritage.
Kathleen: Is ready to get the job done and be the true leader Montana deserves.
Maryland Matt: Is ready to line his own pockets and cater to his special interest donors.
If you want a true champion to lead for Montana in Congress, we need to ensure that Kathleen has the resources to win in November. Will you chip in to help Kathleen Williams be Montana’s next representative?

August is a critical month for our campaign and one of our most difficult. We still need to raise $22,837 before the 31st, and we’re in the midst of the slow summer fundraising season.
That means there’s no guarantee that we’ll make our fundraising goal before the month ends.

We need to put in the work and build the resources to secure a victory in November. There’s no sugarcoating it, we need to raise $22,837 in the next five days to get us back on track to win. Will you make a difference by donating right now?

We just got word that we’re officially on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s (DCCC) Red to Blue Program! This means this is now a nationally recognized top-tier race! We’re making waves in Montana and across the country.
Will you help us celebrate this major milestone for our campaign by building our momentum, energy and campaign resources with a $20.20 contribution?

Recognition from the DCCC means two things: 1) In this race, it’s anyone’s game to take the seat in November and 2) Maryland Matt and his special interest friends are ready to flood our state with dark money to win.
In a tied campaign like ours, the only way we can win in November is if we invest in Kathleen now.
Our campaign is starting to attract national attention, and our opponents are getting worried. Help us fend off any attacks already in the pipeline today by chipping into Kathleen’s campaign now.

2,000 miles. That’s the distance between Montana and DC. And yet, Club for Growth is acting like Montana is their playground.
DC special interest groups are growing even more concerned about our race. They know that without Maryland Matt in their pocket, they have no way to push their far-right agenda in Congress.
This is why they’re about to release a flurry of attack ads against Kathleen.
This dark money group is ready to spend over $1,000,000 to tarnish Kathleen’s dedication to public service. That’s why we opened our Defend Kathleen Fund. Will you stand against partisan bullying by sending in $10 right now?

Montanans don’t need East Coast pundits telling them what to think. They’ve seen the work that dedicated public servants like Kathleen do to protect public lands and keep our communities healthy.
But Club for Growth has a lot of power with millions in their bank account. They have almost unlimited power to say whatever they want and they’re not afraid to use it to misrepresent Kathleen.
It’s critical to fill our $5,000 Defend Kathleen Fund to get ahead of the falsehoods they’re willing to dish out. Will you help us raise the last $2,789 we need before tomorrow’s deadline?

Every day our goal gets more and more critical. Montana’s future can either be in the hands of the people or a far-right extremist who answers only to special interests.
From her work to protect cancer patients to keeping water in Montana’s streams, to growing and diversifying our economy, Kathleen has proven herself as a leader ready to do what’s right for Montanans.
But GOP special interest groups are going to throw the kitchen sink at Kathleen to try and stop her.
That’s why we need to give them a big shock when they see our next public fundraising report in a few days. Will you send in $20 today to help chip away at our $30,000 end-of-quarter goal?

Now that we’ve closed the books on July, we are reaching the home stretch. In order to stay on target, we will need to raise our monthly projections if we want to take the next step forward.
But here’s the truth: it’s very difficult to fundraise in the summer, even though we’re only three months away from November’s election. That means we need every supporter possible to step up to hit every goal we set for ourselves.

Montanans will cast their ballots by June 2nd for their choice on who will stand in one of the most important elections in decades. And right now, we’re in the best position possible to elect a fighter for Montana.
We have the greatest opportunity to send a real, independent leader to the table where big decisions are made.
We can’t send just another rubber stamp to Congress that will toe the same line Gianforte has. We need a leader who’ll fight for Montana’s outdoor heritage, ensure everyone has access to quality, affordable healthcare and find the best solutions to our biggest challenges -- no matter which party they come from.
Kathleen Williams is that leader.
To make sure we send Kathleen to Congress, we’re launching a $15,000 end-of-month fundraising drive. We have just 7 days until Montana voters cast their ballots. Will you help kick things off by sending in your donation today?
Thanks!

It’s our time to shine again.
At the end of June, we have to send in a stellar report that shows all the energy we’ve gained since we won Montana’s Democratic primary.
But I won’t lie to you, it’s an uphill battle.
With so many eyes on this race, our opponent will be waiting to see us fail. And unless we have a running start out of the gate, we won’t be able to reach our $30,000 goal.
That’s why we’re working overtime to make sure we hit this goal. Our grassroots supporters have stepped up before. Will you pitch in with a $30 contribution today?
Thank you,

We’re facing our first major challenge since winning Montana’s Democratic Primary. In just over a week, we have to send our public fundraising report to the FEC -- where all eyes will be laser-focused on how strong our campaign is.
We can’t show any signs of weakness when national Republican special interests comb through reports trying to decide where to invest their dark money.
That’s why we’re looking for our groups of small-dollar donors to help our campaign submit the strongest report possible. We need to raise $30,000 before June 30th’s midnight deadline. Can you chip in today?

There’s no way to sugarcoat this, all eyes are on our campaign and there’s a slew of Republican dollars waiting to see if our campaign shows any weakness.
Maryland Matt may have his special interest donors, but we’re proud to roll up our sleeves, get to work and ask our hardworking supporters to join us in the sprint to the finish line.
We only have 8 days until our June 30th deadline. Can you chip in $30 now?
Thank you,

The difference between Kathleen and Matt Rosendale couldn’t be more clear: one is an avid sportswoman, daughter of a World War II veteran and a champion for expanding healthcare coverage. The other? A developer from the East Coast reaching for another rung on the political ladder.
That’s the choice that Montanans have to make this November and we’re doing everything we can to ensure voters get to hear both sides of the story -- not just what Rosendale’s dark money-funded ads say about us, or how he’s trying to reinvent himself and his extreme record.
But we’re running out of time. With the election less than four months away, we need to build up the resources required to win. Will you chip in any amount today?

Your $10 donation today can help us gain an edge in a race that continues to be neck and neck with just months before the general election. Will you pitch in today?
We want to be the campaign that sends real leadership to Washington, but it’ll be a team effort to make that happen.
We need someone in Congress who gets our Montana way of life. Someone who will fight for the small business owner in Billings and the ranchers and farmers in Choteau. And we deserve someone who will protect Medicare for our seniors and prevent predatory, short-term junk insurance plans from being unwittingly sold to working families.
I’m ready to be that leader. Matt Rosendale is not. But his campaign is being propped up by dark money and his insurance special interests. That’s why I need you to chip in $15 today to stop him from buying this election.

Right now, this race is still tied. That means anyone can take the lead and run with it. Help us pull ahead!
Maryland Matt is just too out of touch to ever be of service to the people he’s supposed to represent. He’s an out-of-state land developer who doesn’t know our Montana way of life.
I’m ready to show Congress what Montana leadership really looks like -- independent, focused and willing to work with people of all political stripes to get good work done. Will you help me represent the state I love by sending in a donation of any amount right now?
Thank you,

Kathleen Williams for Congress
I want to ask you to donate $25 to my campaign right off the success we had during our end-of-quarter fundraising. Here’s why:
We’re entering the final stages of the campaign. Right now, there are only 32 days that stand between us and November 3rd’s General Election.
And in that time, we still have a lot of work to do.
October is our absolute, final month of campaigning. Not only do we need to bring in a budget that will keep the campaign running for the month, but we also need to gather the resources required to get Montanans crucial voting information, our campaign ads in front of as many voters as possible and edge out Maryland Matt in November.
But all those things take big dollars to accomplish. That’s why I’m turning to my grassroots supporters: will you help kick off October right by sending in a $25 donation right now?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50
$100 $250 Other
I’m ready to take my seat in Congress to be the independent voice Montanans deserve. But this year has been a clear reminder of what happens when special-interest funded Super PACs are allowed to take to the airwaves and lie. They’ve done it before, and now they’re doing it for Rosendale.
When I’m elected, Montanans will be sending a powerful message to the Washington establishment that out-of-state phonies have no business representing the interests of our ranchers, farmers, business owners, or our families. Help me make the message one they can’t ignore with your donation today.
Thank you,

Kathleen Williams for Congress
Just today we found out that Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House leader, has raised $103,000,000 this year -- including nearly $20,000,000 last quarter alone.
And guess who has been a proud recipient of his D.C. handouts? My opponent Matt Rosendale.
I wish I could say I was surprised, but we call him Maryland Matt for a reason.
He proves us right over and over. It’s clear who Maryland Matt really works for -- his special interest donors and DC political interests. We’re up against an opponent who's more focused on the swamp than Montana. Can I count on you to keep this race competitive with a $25 donation?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50
$100 $250 Other
Not only is McCarthy happy to raise money for an East Coast developer, he’s even scheduled to be in Montana this week to talk to donors and bring in even more dollars to his campaign.
Maryland Matt knows he needs every resource he can get to beat me. From the shady Super PACs running attack ads that lie about my record, to the countless surrogates that have used their influence to rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars, Matt can’t get support in Montana so he looks elsewhere.
But I’m proud to have the people of Montana on my side, and we’ll show just how strong we are.
So let’s make sure Matt, Kevin and everyone in Washington knows the power behind my grassroots, people-powered campaign. Chip in $10 to keep our efforts strong and WIN in 19 days.
Thank you,

Friends,
My name is Cheri Bustos and I serve Illinois’ 17th District in Congress.
I've been looking over the numbers for weeks and one thing is very clear: Kathleen’s race will be a close race all the way to Election Day. Kathleen’s polling numbers are neck and neck with her opponent and whenever she gets a leg up, Matt Rosendale meets her efforts.
That’s why I am asking you to help her break out of her tie and beef up her final end-of-quarter finance report before her September 30th deadline. Will you make this happen with a $25 contribution?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50
$100 $250 Other
This will be one of Kathleen’s last moments to break the tie and take the lead. A public finance report with numbers this big will tell the big special interests in Washington that we mean business.
So help us hit Kathleen’s final fundraising goal before the election. Chip in $25 to invest in the future of Montana.
Thank you,

Kathleen Williams for Congress
It’s Steve Bullock. I wanted to send you a quick note about why Kathleen is depending on your support this November.
We’re now 26 days away from the General Election and the choice for Montanans is clear: Kathleen Williams is the only candidate fighting for our best interests. Just take a peek at Matt Rosendale’s record:
1. As Insurance Commissioner, he has pushed healthcare plans that don't cover preexisting conditions.
2. He supported backdoor legislation to make it easier to transfer and sell off public lands.
3. And he continues to be a party puppet ready to slash taxes for the wealthy and gut Social Security.
It’s clear as day: Matt Rosendale will always put his party over the people of Montana. It’s time for Montanans to have a leader they can depend on in Congress. Will you rush in $20.20 to help support Kathleen Williams today?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50
$100 $250 Other
This election will determine Montana’s future for decades to come. We can either have a champion for our public lands and bipartisan leader as our voice into the future, or an East Coast developer looking to make a quick buck off his latest political position.
The choice is up to you. Help make sure Kathleen has her best shot at victory before we hit the final days of the election by chipping in any amount today.

Kathleen Williams for Congress
After last night’s debate in Montana, the choice is clear -- Kathleen Williams is the only candidate fighting for the future of our communities.
While Kathleen stood up and offered her vision for all Montanans regardless of political stripe, Maryland Matt resorted to partisan talking points to cover up his desire to rip healthcare away from millions, ignore the climate crisis and transform Montana into something we wouldn't recognize.
We know that Kathleen will always stand up for the good of our country and our state in Congress. Help us get her to D.C. by rushing in a $20.20 donation. There are only 6 more days until our public finance report is due!
Thank you,

Friends,
I wanted to send a quick update on our numbers just five days before our September 30th public deadline.
In four days, we were able to bring in $6,678 from 305 donors. It’s a great start, but if we want to get the numbers we need before the month ends, we need to pick up speed.
Will you help us get even further into our September goal by chipping in $25 right now?

Whatever comes in before our public report is released will help dictate our budget as we move from fundraising and talking to voters about their priorities into Get Out the Vote initiatives that will ensure Montanans can safely submit their ballots for Kathleen.
On top of that, we still have ad buys in the pipeline necessary to counteract the millions of dollars that have already flooded our airwaves and made our advertising very expensive.
Your investment into Kathleen’s campaign is what we base our entire budget on. Keep our campaign competitive and strong by sending in any amount now to beef up our end-of-quarter report.
Thank you for your continued support,

My own political career has shown me what it takes to be a Montana leader, and I know Kathleen has what it takes to be our voice. While our legislative service did not overlap, I had the opportunity to work with her on a variety of demanding and complicated issues dealing with water, women’s health, and conservation. She is a worker and she is a fighter.
Every day I see Kathleen putting in the hard work it takes to win. She needs our support to finish first in the face of powerful dark money Super PACs working to defeat her.

Kathleen Williams for Congress
We know that there are many bridges we need to continue to build when it comes to closing the urban-rural divide -- including access to health care.
The fact is, many Montanans have to spend hours traveling in order to see a doctor or mental health specialist. In some cases, Montanans live without doctors in their town. Veterans and tribal members often face additional access challenges.
That’s unacceptable.
Ensuring rural health care is more important than ever, and it’s up to us to act. Will you add your name with mine and tell Congress to get to work on improving our patchwork of rural health care?
Improve Rural Health Care!
We must make our voices heard now to work towards ensuring every Montanan across the state has access to affordable and reliable health care. Where we choose to live in Montana shouldn’t determine the quality of care we receive. Kathleen has passed legislation that is saving lives and reducing costs. She is a proven champion for this issue.
Rural health services help keep our communities intact. Join us in demanding solutions.
Add your name now and tell Congress to improve rural health care!
Our communities are depending on us.
Thanks,
Montanans for Kathleen

Here’s the thing: running ads across a state as big as Montana is an expensive endeavor.
With National Republican Groups and far-right Super PACs buying up every single minute of airtime that’s available, the cost of running our own ads is getting pricier by the day.

Breaking campaign finance laws. That’s how desperate the Montana GOP is to elect Maryland Matt Rosendale.
Current headline
Instead of playing fair, and LEGALLY, they’ve dug into their bag of dirty tricks and have decided to prop up a party without permission and secretly moved money around to cut down our efforts to elect trustworthy, Montana leaders to Congress.
But now they’ve been caught red-handed, and we have an opportunity to show them that the people of Montana won’t stand for this disrespect to our democracy.
Show the Montana GOP that we won’t let them skirt the law by helping us get 200 donations today to Kathleen’s campaign. Once they see us rally our supporters over this, they’re going to really regret their shady tactics!

Greg Gianforte is clearly out of touch with hardworking Montanans. On top of assaulting a reporter and lying about it, it now appears Gianforte used insider information to profit from the coronavirus pandemic by investing in medical companies that would benefit from it.
This kind of profiteering off of the backs of hard-working Americans is exactly why we need a different kind of leader representing Montana in the U.S. House!

Years of hard work and dedication from our team of grassroots supporters will come down to what happens on November 3rd.
But polling from just the other day shows us down by ONE POINT, well within the margin of error. That means this is still anybody’s race.
That’s why these final days are critical to our campaign. If we don’t get the turnout we need at the polls, there’s no way we can win.  I need your support now more than ever. Can I count on you to rush in a donation to my Get Out the Vote Fund?

Montanans deserve a real leader in the House fighting for our values, our communities and our best interests. We only have one seat in Congress, and we have to make sure the right person gets it.
We need a true, independent voice fighting for our state in Washington. Montanans don’t want partisanship, they want to see results and to see that their communities are cared about and supported.
I’m ready to be that voice. Matt Rosendale is not. It really is that simple.
That’s why I’m fighting for my chance to show the best that Montana leadership has to offer. But I’m counting on my supporters to help make that happen. Can I count on you to send a donation of any size to help make that possible by winning one of the most competitive races in the country?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50
$100 $250 Other
We have big goals as we sprint to the finish. This month we have to send in our final end-of-quarter FEC report before the election, and get the word out about my vision for our state to as many people as we possibly can.
It’s crunch time. There are only 60 more days to make this all possible, and mail ballots go out in just a few weeks. Will you chip in $15 to help support our efforts all the way to November 3rd?
Thank you so much,
\-- Kathleen

Today is the last day of our fundraising drive and we still need to raise $2,346 before midnight. It may seem like a big job, but we can do it if we work together.
Our grassroots supporter team is huge and ready to get the job done. There isn’t much time left, so it’s time to put our foot to the gas.
Will you chip in just $5 right now to help reach our end-of-month fundraising goal? If everyone reading this gave right now, we’d be finished in no time.

Today is Dad’s day.
On this Father’s Day, I wanted to send a quick message to you and your family. I hope today, you find special ways to appreciate the fathers in your life.
I have two favorite fathers - my own, and my husband.
My father and I faced challenges together when I was young, partnering as care-givers to my mother with early-onset Alzheimers. It was a difficult time but helped us be the best of friends throughout our lives.
Here’s to you, Dad! Thanks for all the love, guidance, and fun over so many years.
And to the other incredible father in my life, Tom, who exemplified love, strength, honor, and kindness to Calen and Sander (and me). Thanks for all you shared and gave; you are with us always.
May you all enjoy loving and being loved by wonderful fathers, today and every day.
On this special day,

Team,
We’re getting closer and closer to our July fundraising deadline, and we know that Maryland Matt is betting against us hitting our goal to reach $20,000 by the end of the month.
Will help us defeat Matt Rosendale by chipping in $15 right now?

Why? Because if we have the resources we need to win and we send Kathleen to Congress, he knows Kathleen will:
1. Fight for main street, not his special interest buddies
2. Protect Montana’s outdoor heritage and not bow down to out of state developers or block public access to public spaces
3. And build a more equal healthcare system that will make sure that every American has the coverage they need, and not risky insurance plans that leave patients holding the bag
And that’s what Kathleen will fight to accomplish in just her first term as Montana’s only House representative.
But to get there, we can’t fall short of this month’s goal. Will you fight for Montanans, our state and our nation by sending Kathleen to Congress with your donation?
Thank you,

Kathleen’s small-dollar, grassroots supporters have been a key part of this campaign, especially those who make monthly recurring contributions.
This grassroots support allows us to continue listening to the stories of Montanans and continue running a race to send true, independent representation to the U.S. House.
We are grateful for every dollar we get through the door, but we need to continue developing a sustainable base of income for the rest of this campaign if we’re going to win. That’s why we’re asking our top supporters -- will you make an online, monthly donation today? There are only 3 months left!
Make a Monthly Recurring Donation
Kathleen promised to not take one cent of corporate PAC money.
Why? It’s part of her commitment to stand with everyday Montanans, not special interests or dark-money donors.
An online monthly contribution of $3, $10, or even $20 provides the basis for our campaign operations. Will you make a recurring contribution today?
Thank you again for your unending support. Together, we’ll win this race and send Kathleen to Congress.

This is a huge deal -- it’s only February, and Trump has just endorsed Matt Rosendale. We’re starting a $10,000 rapid response goal to cancel out the surge of money we know that Matt Rosendale will receive from this endorsement.
Let’s continue to show him why he should be nervous - we have grassroots support and a vision of real representation for Montana.
Will you chip in $30 right now towards our rapid response goal and send a clear message to Matt Rosendale that he can’t slow down Kathleen’s momentum?
Matt Rosendale is pulling out all the stops two months into 2020 because he sees the writing on the wall. He knows that this is going to be one of the most expensive House races in the country and is working overtime to get every penny into his campaign against Kathleen.

Did you see this?
The Club for Growth, a right-wing dark money group and one of Matt Rosendale’s top DC allies, is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to interfere with Montana’s election. They know that Rosendale would blindly toe the line for special interests like them, while Kathleen is going to be a real representative for Montanans.
It’s clear big dark money groups like Club for Growth will stop at nothing to buy this election. We won’t let them get away with this.

Friends, this Wednesday is Earth Day!
This is an opportunity to reflect on the beauty and value of what makes Montana the Last Best Place and the importance of conservation to the future of our planet.
With 75% of Montanans considering themselves conservationists, we’re a big group.
I’m proud to have fought to protect our land, air, wildlife, soil and waters - our forests, plains and open spaces. When I left Montana's fish and wildlife agency over 15 years ago, I received a plaque saying that Montana's rivers were better off because I cared ""and knew what to do."" That award still means the world to me and represents the approach I'll bring to Congress. It's not just caring; it's doing.
But I need your voice behind me to do this work. Will you stand with 75% of Montanans today by renewing your commitment to protecting our planet?
We all have a responsibility to lighten our footprint on our world. And the numbers who agree are overwhelming:
1. 85% of Montanans believe that companies should pay fees to mine on public lands
2. 67% support full funding to the Land and Water Conservation Fund
3. 84% believe that issues of clean water, clean air, wildlife and public lands are important in determining their support for an elected official
And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. On Earth Day this Wednesday, will you commit to stand with me in protecting the beauty and resources that sustain us all?
Thank you, Happy Earth Day!

No members of our communities should have to go through their day with the looming fear that their life may be upended by senseless, preventable violence.
We need to raise awareness and work to end violence against indigenous women. Kathleen is committed to standing with them -- are you? Add your name now.

Kathleen Williams for Congress
Too often, we see reports of Indigenous women throughout Montana go missing or become victims of human trafficking and violence. Even worse, this violence repeatedly goes unreported and unresolved.
According to the National Institute of Justice, more than four in five indigenous women have experienced some sort of violence in their lifetime. That’s unacceptable. It’s time to ensure our Native communities get justice and support for safety they deserve in their everyday lives.
If you’re with me, add your name to say: We won’t stand for this violence.
Thousands of Native women go missing each year, and for every one reported, there are countless others who will go unreported. Montana’s native women - and men, and children - deserve safety, security and our voice to help end the violence.
As your next Congresswoman, I am committed to continuing to work closely with Montana’s native communities, both on- and off-reservation, to address issues and foster opportunity for all.
Add your name with mine today to join me in fighting for an end to all violence against indigenous women.
Thanks for taking a stand.

We’re just shy of being 100 days out from November’s General Election. That’s why it’s even more important to move the needle in favor of our campaign.
There are just over three months to get our message out to every voter possible regardless of their political stripes. The only way Kathleen can win is if we bring Democrats, Republicans and Independents together - luckily, Kathleen has done that her entire career.
A mission this ambitious takes a substantial amount of resources. Will you help us move past the deadlock and raise the $20,000 we need to push through?

July will be an important month for our campaign. Right now we’re still neck and neck with our opponent Matt Rosendale.
Polling graphic
We’re tied at 47 - 47. And now, the Montana GOP is doing whatever they can to make sure Maryland Matt surges ahead of us. And they’re not afraid to continue to play dirty.
That’s why we need to rise to the challenge and be the first campaign over the hill. We’re launching a $20,000 goal to get us ahead of the curve before July ends. Will you join us with a $30 donation?

We have just over three months left in this campaign, so there is no time to waste. If we don’t act now, you can guarantee that a land developer who doesn’t understand Montana will be elected. Help us make sure that doesn’t happen by chipping in before our July 31st deadline.

We’re on thin ice here.
We're tied with Maryland Matt Rosendale's dark money funded campaign.
And after our standout fundraising performance last month, Rosendale’s dark money checks are already funneling through the pipeline in an effort to squeeze past Kathleen.

All eyes are on Montana this year. With our Governorship, U.S. Senate and the House seat all up for grabs, we need to do our part to usher in a new wave of independent and fierce leaders in Washington.  But we need your support to get there.
We’re reaching every voter we can to get the message out about Kathleen’s Montana values. But with four months until the election, time is running out fast. We can turn the tide onto our side, but we can’t do that without your support. Will we see your donation before tonight ends?

We have big plans to surpass the ground game we had in 2018 -- when we came the closest in over 20 years to unseat an incumbent in Montana's House seat. It’s a big goal, and there are a lot of variables, but we can win in 2020 -- but that’s only if we can keep up the resources to take us to victory.
Will you send in your contribution before Sunday ends tonight? No matter the size of your donation, we can beat our goal TONIGHT.

Team,
With polling still showing this race deadlocked, we know Maryland Matt may surge ahead. Why? He’s received backing from not just one, but TWO Washington, DC special interest funded groups.
We knew that Club for Growth had rushed in $1,400,000 in attack ad spending, but we didn’t expect another GOP PAC to swoop in with another $500,000.
With these numbers on his side, he’s getting a critical boost just two months before the election. But we have the opportunity to show Maryland Matt and his DC swamp handlers how strong our grassroots support really is. Will you chip in $20.20 to stop Washington Special Interests from meddling in our race?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50
$100 $250 Other
We want KATHLEEN to surge when the next polling numbers are released. But until we can combat the resources already in the pipeline, we’re risking falling far behind. We’re happy to be supported by hardworking Montanans, and we need your help to stand up to major Super PAC spending. Will I see your donation tonight?
Thanks,
Jeff Allen

Kathleen Williams for Congress
One thing is clear: our democracy is in need of a major repair. Today, in honor of International Anti-Corruption Day, we’re building a call for action.
The people of Montana deserve leaders who will fight for them and actually get things done -- that's why in Congress I'll work on fixing a broken campaign finance system and bring the ethical representation Montanans and Americans deserve.
No one is above the law in our country -- especially politicians.
ADD YOUR NAME HERE: Let’s make campaign finance reform a top priority. Add your name with mine to fight corruption.
FIGHT CORRUPTION
Corruption comes in many forms. Whether it’s special interest groups buying off politicians or representatives selling off public lands for private gain, it’s up to us to elect ethical representatives accountable to the people, not special interests.
Right now, my campaign is doing everything it can to be an example of trustworthy leadership. I’m proud to have the support of End Citizens United, and I’m proud that our campaign is funded at the grassroots level - 89% of our campaign contributions are $100 or less.
ADD YOUR NAME TODAY
But it’s only a start. We all deserve ethical representation. Join us in calling for campaign finance reform and an end to corruption and cronyism at the highest levels. We need your voice.
SIGN HERE: Help us end corruption and build a better democracy by signing on to our petition today.
Thanks for making your voice heard.

Please be safe and follow CDC guidance during the coronavirus outbreak. As our country works through this difficult time, please join me in reaching out to those in need or who are feeling isolated - we are all in this together.
Friends, throughout this entire campaign there’s been some pretty wild challenges. But my fight to represent the state we all love only grows stronger.
Here’s why I keep fighting for Montana:
1. Dark money beneficiaries like Matt Rosendale and Greg Gianforte are ready to sell out the people they’re sworn to represent
2. In the face of a global crisis, the current administration is still working to strike down the ACA in court, which would impact 1 in 10 Montanans
3. Montana only has ONE House seat and we’ve seen what happens when that goes to the wrong person
That’s why I’m in this fight to send real leadership to Congress this November. Chip in $10 to help make sure we have the resources we need to run a successful campaign.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25
$50 $100
$250 Other
We’ve seen our campaign evolve over the last few weeks and it means your small-dollar support is more critical than ever. When summer hits, we need to make sure we’ve built our own wave of support to combat the flood of Republican dark money that’s heading toward Montana.
Can I count on you to chip in $20 before April 30th?
Thank you,
Kathleen Williams

Let’s get back to this holiday’s origins and take this opportunity to reflect on the selflessness and statesmanship displayed by so many of our presidents. Add your name to our President’s Day card to celebrate our country’s legacy of leadership.
With the 2020 presidential race well underway, the qualities we all want in a commander-in-chief are top of mind. Americans deserve a president they can trust will lead with dignity, integrity, and understanding.
This is a uniquely American holiday, so let’s take the time to honor our strong democratic roots. We honor the many Presidents and their families who have served our country through so many historic and challenging times. May incredible and dedicated public servants continue this important legacy.

Hi there,
In these challenging times, we must still take time to celebrate the little things. I’m going to take some time today to show my appreciation to my favorite canine campaign companion. Join me in wishing Danni a happy 6th birthday!
In 2018, Danni traveled throughout the state with me helping turnout the canine vote from Missoula to Miles City. We both (mostly) sacrificed the bird-hunting season, and now, in 2020 she’s back and ready to do it all over again!
Will you pitch in $20 today to make sure we have the resources to get back out across the state (when it’s safe) so that Danni can help me meet with Montanans of all political stripes and work to protect our best interests?
These last few weeks have only proven how vital it is for an independent voice from Montana to step up to the plate in Washington, roll up her sleeves, and get to work fighting for our best interests.
If you have the ability, can you chip in $25 today, to help us raise the $20,000 we need before our fundraising numbers go public for the first time this year?
Thank you,

Right now, we’re in a predicament: we still need to raise $5,827 before tomorrow at midnight and the amount of donations coming in has been stagnant.
This is our last shot to get all of our final ads up, or we’ll have to make deep budget cuts to our outreach efforts in the last few days.
See it for yourself. Read Kathleen’s note from earlier, and then please rush in $20.20 to help hit our goal.

Kathleen Williams for Congress
This is going to be closer than we thought.
Yesterday, we were projected to bring in $7,500 which is half of our advertising budget needed to make sure our final ads are up before Facebook’s deadline for posting new ads.
We barely made it. And now, we need to raise another $6,983 before tomorrow’s midnight deadline to make sure our television ads can stay up.
I need your help now. Will you chip in to make sure we hit our $15,000 advertising goal before tomorrow?

There’s no room for error. Right now, Maryland Matt with his own money and that of his Super PAC backers are building their final ad budgets and I can guarantee they are going to make sure they get plenty of airtime.
It’s up to us to keep up with their efforts, or my message to the voters could get drowned out by their outright false claims against me. Will you give $5, $25 or $50 right now to make sure we can compete on the air in these final days?
Thank you,

Kathleen Williams isn’t running a campaign like Maryland Matt Rosendale’s and we’re proud of that.
Will you help us spread the word on the differences between the two candidates with a $21 donation?
Unlike Maryland Matt, Kathleen:
1. Fights for tax cuts for the middle class and small business owners -- not just massive corporations or the richest 1% who give money to his campaign
2. Puts Montana’s outdoor heritage first and won’t pave the way for privatizing our public lands
3. Is dedicated to public service and won’t use her time in Congress to just climb the political ladder.
The difference is night and day. Kathleen will fight for Montana’s best interests in Congress. Matt Rosendale will be fighting for his special interest mega-donors. Let’s make sure we send a real Montana leader to Congress in 12 days with your $21 donation.

I'm Denise Juneau, Former Democratic Candidate for Montana’s At-Large Congressional District. Today I am proud to announce that I am endorsing Kathleen Williams to represent Montana in Congress.
She’s the strong, independent leader Montanans deserve and her team and I need your help to send her to Washington. Will you chip in $20 to make sure Kathleen wins this November?
As a life-long natural resource advocate and a champion of Montana’s outdoor heritage, Kathleen understands how important our environment, and the correct management of it, is to Montana’s economic future.
During her time in the statehouse, she ensured that public dollars went to public schools. In Congress, I know that she’ll fight to improve public schools so that everyone can get an education that allows them to pursue their dreams. As Montana’s former Superintendent of Public Instruction, I know just how important that commitment is!
But most importantly, I know that Kathleen won’t be swayed by political tactics or big, corporate backers. She’s proud to forge her own path and find the best solutions no matter where they come from.
Congress needs more people like Kathleen, and you can help her get there.
I’m excited to announce my endorsement of Kathleen to her top supporters, but I want to do even more. Will you send in $10 right now to give Kathleen a big boost in her fundraising numbers?
Thank you,

Politico Headline
Right now, Republican-controlled states are ganging up to jeopardize healthcare for over 20 million Americans, directly fueled by support from the current administration.
Instead of expanding coverage, their solution to the rising cost of healthcare? Put millions at risk of being kicked off of their insurance.
We need to elect leaders who are willing to stand up and protect coverage for millions of Americans. We need leaders like Kathleen. That’s where you come in. Will you chip in to help her get to Congress and lower costs and increase coverage? Not the other way around.

Countless American families depend on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to lower costs and prevent insurance companies from taking advantage of them and their health conditions.
But to some, eliminating the ACA means that their insurance buddies will be more than happy to fund their campaigns.
We need to stand up to bullies willing to strip coverage to line their pockets. Rush in a $10 contribution so that Kathleen Williams can stand up against them.

On Purple Heart Day, we remember those extraordinary people who have served in our military and armed forces.
Every year, thousands of men and women answer the call to serve our country. They leave their communities and homes to defend our freedoms in many different places.
Today brings me special memories of my friend Rae Peppers and her son, Pfc. Joshua Peppers. After Josh was wounded in Afghanistan, and received his Purple Heart for his bravery, Rae pushed the Montana statehouse to provide scholarships so that Purple Heart recipients across Montana could receive an education and begin the next chapter of their lives a little easier.
Montana is proud to be a state with exceptionally high rates of military service, including in our Native communities. Today, and every day, we thank them for their service. And they not only deserve our thanks, but to receive the services they have been promised.
When you elect me to serve Montana in Congress, I’ll ensure that this mission is always prioritized and accomplished.

100 days. That’s all the time we have to get ahead of our opponent, win the November election, and make history in Montana.
All this makes getting ahead in our polling numbers even more critical. At every step, we’ve been deadlocked with our opponent and you can count on Maryland Matt’s dark money donors standing behind him by writing him massive checks.
So let’s show them that we don’t need to sell out to developers or special interests with armies of lobbyists in order to win an election. We need another $18,928 to close the books on July successfully. Will you chip in today?

BREAKING NEWS: Our Republican opponent, Matt Rosendale, has JUST been added to the national Republican campaign arm’s Young Guns Program, guaranteeing a flood of GOP money heading to Montana.

This is the calm before the storm for our race.
We just learned that Matt Rosendale has been raised to “the highest and final level” of the NRCC’s Young Guns Program. That means national Republican groups and donors are all-in to protect the status-quo in Montana.
We’re only at the beginning of a long fight.
We need to step up to the challenge of making history in Montana, but it won’t be easy. That’s why we’re asking our supporters to stand against the wave of GOP dollars about to pour into Montana. Will you chip in to support Kathleen today?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

From what we’re gathering, the NRCC believes that Maryland Matt is “well-positioned” to defeat Kathleen in November. We disagree. Even with dark money checks already being written, they’re looking to their own supporters to push them past the finish line - thankfully, we have you.
With a major report just days away, our campaign must be strong right before the GOP dives headfirst into the race. Help us double our resources today and send Kathleen to Washington in November.
Thank you,

Folks, our path is clear -- we have a direct roadmap to how we win the General Election in 2020.
First: We continue to reach every voter in every corner of Montana, get the word out about Kathleen and submit our largest fundraising report of 2020.
Then: We’ll use those resources to ensure Montanans can see Kathleen for who she is - a true, independent voice rooted in their hopes, struggles and dreams, who will get results for Montana, not special interests.
Finally: We’ll celebrate Kathleen’s historic win on November 3rd, as she’ll finally bring back honest representation for Montanans in Congress.
But to get to the big victory on November 3rd, we have to keep hitting the pavement and getting Kathleen’s vision to the people who matter -- the hardworking families of Montana. Will you support our efforts with a $20.20 donation?

Kathleen Williams for Congress
Too often, we see reports of Indigenous women throughout Montana go missing or become victims of human trafficking and violence. Even worse, this violence repeatedly goes unreported and unresolved.
According to the National Institute of Justice, more than four in five indigenous women have experienced some sort of violence in their lifetime. That’s unacceptable. It’s time to ensure our Native communities get justice and support for safety they deserve in their everyday lives.
If you’re with me, add your name to say: We won’t stand for this violence.
Thousands of Native women go missing each year, and for every one reported, there are countless others who will go unreported. Montana’s native women - and men, and children - deserve safety, security and our voice to help end the violence.
As your next Congresswoman, I am committed to continuing to work closely with Montana’s native communities, both on- and off-reservation, to address issues and foster opportunity for all.
Add your name with mine today to join me in fighting for an end to all violence against indigenous women.
Thanks for taking a stand.

Friends,
At the end of the month, Kathleen and the team will be submitting their final, end-of-quarter report before November’s General Election and we want to submit this one with a bang.
We’re looking to add $35,000 to our budget numbers before our September 30th deadline and Kathleen needs your help to make it happen. Help us kick things off early with a $30 contribution today.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

This one of the last times our numbers will be public for everyone to see before the General Election -- and that means the Washington Super PACs pumping up Maryland Matt’s campaign will see exactly where we stand.
That’s why we need to make sure we send in our strongest report yet. Not only that, but this is also a prime opportunity to get in the final resources we’ll need in the final weeks of the campaign as soon as we enter October.
So help Kathleen and the entire team send in a strong report that reflects the growing momentum behind their campaign. Will you make a donation of any size right now?
CHIP IN $30 HERE

Thank you for another successful end-of-quarter fundraising drive. The team had late nights to ensure that we could move past our projections, and in the end, it was our network of hardworking Montana supporters that got the job done.
For all of your dedication this week, thank you.
Now we’re in the final stretch of this election. Voting in most areas starts tomorrow. For the next 33 days, Montanans will decide who they want to lead them in Congress -- an East Coast developer backed by wealthy DC special interests or a true voice for Montana.
If you want to help guarantee that Kathleen will fight for the future of our state in Congress, chip in $10 right now to help us get ahead of our goals for the month.
Thank you for your continued support,

Tied tweet
Despite our best efforts, our race is STILL a tossup! Even the latest polling from NBC shows us still TIED with Maryland Matt.
This election will be decided by a razor thin margin and even though we’ve spent the entire summer trying to get ahead, Matt Rosendale has fought back our efforts with his Super PAC dollars keeping him and his campaign afloat. And now he's putting his personal wealth into the campaign, too.
We can't let him buy this seat.

Montanans are happy to roll up their sleeves and get stuff done and I’m ready to do the same when I win this election and head to Washington.
But in order to get to that point, we need to hit every goal we set for ourselves. Working hard now means we’ll get to reap the benefits of our work on Election Day.

Matt Rosendale is still trying to cozy up with donors -- instead of helping Montanans get affordable health care during a global pandemic. We hope campaigns or the GOP is at least covering the costs to our communities when these DC types come to town!
It’s clear as day: Rosendale is more interested in his political fortunes than solving issues facing Montanans like high health care costs and supporting small businesses.
That’s why before Mike Pence gets here, we want to get 500 Rapid Response Donations to our campaign to stand up against the major BOOST Maryland Matt is likely to get on Monday. Will you help out the team by donating $20 right now?

Please be safe and follow CDC guidance during the coronavirus outbreak. As our country works through this difficult time, please join me in reaching out to those in need or who are feeling isolated - we are all in this together.
Earlier this year, the Bureau of Land Management released a final resource management plan for 650,000 acres of public lands in central Montana -- a plan that allows 95% of that land to be developed for oil and gas.
Current Headline
Public lands should be managed for multiple uses, not just oil and gas -- especially where there isn’t much in the way of oil and gas resources anyway. Under the 1920 Mineral Leasing Act, these can be non-competitive leases, going for a mere $1.50 per acre, which also shorts American taxpayers. Natural values and nearby communities depend on diverse, science-based management of these lands, not selling them off for industrial, or non-use.
Will you sign my petition to call on Congress to update the 1920 Mineral Leasing Act to eliminate non-competitive leasing and return to reasoned management of our public lands?
I’ve spent my entire career in natural resources and fought to protect Montana’s public lands and waters during my personal work and as a State Legislator, and I’ll continue to do it in Congress.
ADD YOUR NAME
Protecting our public lands is critical to Montanans, our communities, and our economy. How else can we continue to be the Last Best Place? We need to elect members of Congress who get that and will push to update outdated laws that don’t serve our resources or taxpayers well. This is one of them.
If you agree, please, sign my petition.
Thank you,
Kathleen Williams

The attacks on the Post Office continue as millions of Americans are preparing to cast their ballots through the mail -- many for the very first time.
The USPS is an essential government institution that connects even the most remote communities with the rest of the country. Here in Montana, many of our communities depend on the Post Office as their lifeline.
Businesses, seniors, veterans and everyday American families all depend on the USPS. But the Trump administration and Congress would rather see this vital office stripped down to play political games instead of giving people the services they deserve that are set out in the US Constitution.
It’s time for us to stand up to partisan cutting of essential services. Chip in to Kathleen’s campaign today to send a real champion for the work of the USPS here in Montana to Congress!

Friend, I know you’re probably about to turn in for the night so I’ll make this quick -- can you chip in just $5 to keep my campaign strong by hitting our April fundraising goal? We only need 34 more people to donate before midnight.
It’s been too long since we’ve had someone more interested in Montanans than their political future in office. Matt Rosendale would just be more of the same. I’m ready to go fight like hell for you in Washington, but this race is still a toss-up.
You can help us determine the outcome. So please, even just a $5 donation right now can help us get the last 34 donations we need to close the books on April.

I’ll let you in on something that me and my team understand: I’m not the only candidate asking for help to beef up their fundraising numbers before the end of the month.
Matt Rosendale is also hitting the ground running, making sure his numbers look impressive before September ends.
But instead of asking for support from the people he’ll be representing in Congress, he can rely on his insurance industry buddies to make up the difference for dollars he can’t raise.
It may be tougher, but I’m proud to have my campaign supported by hardworking families across Montana. Help ensure our victory in November by giving whatever you can to my campaign today.

There’s a lot to do before the election, and we’re running out of time to get it done. While we work hard to fill our program budgets, Matt gets to kick up his feet and let Washington do the fundraising for him.
But Montanans don’t back down when the road gets tough. We face the challenge and beat it. Help us pick up the last $15,829 I need to send in a stellar report that reflects the true strength of our team.

That’s our average online donation via email. It’s a number we’re proud of because it shows that hardworking Montanans are behind our efforts.
The thing is, Matt Rosendale is raking in money fueled by the DC special interests that know he’ll toe their line in Congress.
We need to work together to stand against the GOP Super PACs and insurance insider dollars fueling his campaign.
We’re proud to be supported by hardworking families because those are the people Kathleen will fight for in Congress. But that puts us at a disadvantage against our far-right, extremist opponent. Will you chip in $28 to help us stay ahead?

Can we count on you to chip in $20 to make sure we can still have a strong shot of sending Kathleen to Congress?
There are less than eight weeks until the General Election and every single dollar we bring in the door is critical to sending true Montana leadership back to Congress. And with your donations, we can make it happen.

Tuesday, April 14th, is RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) Day. This is a day where we recognize the continued fight to end sexual violence in our communities and around the world.
A place this mission is critical is in indigenous communities. Each year, hundreds of indigenous women go missing or are sexually assaulted across the country. Montana alone has some of the highest rates of missing and murdered indigenous women.
It’s up to all of us to end the cycle of violence indigenous women face every day. Take the pledge today: let’s end violence against women.
The mission of RAINN matches the values we should hold every day -- that through our action we CAN address sexual violence. This work is even more critical as we shelter in place, as not all homes are safe for everyone. If you find yourself in an abusive situation, there are resources.
It takes all of us to make it happen. Take the pledge with our team: I will fight against all forms of sexual violence.
TAKE THE PLEDGE

This is going to be a big year and I’m more ready than ever to put in the hard work required to win -- and I know we’ll be successful thanks to your support and hard work. That means we’ll be crisscrossing the state meeting with as many Montanans as possible until Election Day.

Rural communities depend on the Affordable Care Act to ensure that their citizens are healthy and have the coverage they need for affordable and accessible care.
While the law isn’t perfect, it’s even more confusing why this administration is fighting tooth and nail to destroy the ACA, even when they don’t have a replacement.
If we let National Republican politicians get their way, 20 MILLION Americans will be left without any health coverage. We can’t risk that future in Montana. SIGN OUR PETITION today to have your voice heard in Congress: Defend the Affordable Care Act!
ADD YOUR NAME
Here are the facts:
1. After the ACA expansion, nearly 30% of new enrollees in Montana were from rural areas.
2. Medicaid expansion helped increase hospital revenues, decreasing the likelihood that critical, rural healthcare facilities will risk shuttering their doors.
3. Rural health is critical in keeping all communities running.
Montana is a prime example of what can happen when health is prioritized over profits. But our legacy as a healthcare leader is at stake. If we let the Senate and the White House get their way, our rural communities will be the first to feel the brunt of dwindling coverage.
That’s why we need to use our voices together to protect a critical Montana lifeline. Let Congress hear you loud and clear by signing our petition today: PROTECT THE ACA!
Thank you,

Winning in November is going to be expensive and we’ll need everyone on board to get it done.
The Washington Swamp has made Montana and our race a top target. Just this year:
1. Greg Gianforte donated $250,000 to the NRCC which is directly funding our opponent’s campaign
2. Club for Growth greenlighted a million-dollar smear campaign
3. And a House GOP Super PAC pledged another $500,000
We need to do everything we can to make sure we reach our $25,000 goal for August. With your $20.20 donation, we can cut through the dark money working to influence our race. Will you give before our Monday deadline?

GOP Super PACs will do anything to beat us. Why? Because they need Matt Rosendale to toe the line to further their anti-Montana agenda.

Americans need health care coverage to protect their families now, and after the COVID-19 pandemic ends.
Add your name here to call on Congress to ensure coverage and improve access to health care!
ADD MY NAME
* * *
Friends, if the COVID-19 pandemic has shown us anything, it’s that every Montanan deserves access to high-quality, affordable healthcare.
In our state, we’ve been working hard to make sure that every Montanan has the level of coverage they need, regardless of age, gender or pre-existing conditions. Kathleen’s work in the state legislature is saving lives and reducing health care costs. She will continue that work in Washington.
Matt Rosendale doesn’t support coverage for pre-existing conditions. He rubber-stamped a 23% premium increase on the private market. Now he’s taking undeserved credit for lowering premiums slightly from those high levels. As Auditor, his response to COVID was to recommend plans that don’t even have to cover testing and treatment for the virus. Montanans deserve better.
Luckily, we have the power of the people on our side, and Kathleen is experienced in healthcare policy. We need your voice heard today -- add your name to her petition and help us continue the fight for quality, affordable and accessible healthcare.
ADD MY NAME
It’s up to us to protect the gains we’ve made. Right now, Washington, DC Republicans are pursuing their plans to rip healthcare away from thousands.
Why? Because it’ll make their wealthy campaign backers happy.
They need to hear our voices loud and clear.
Kathleen needs you. Let your voice lead the change by signing on to support our efforts to increase access to healthcare for everyone.
Thank you for your commitment to our communities,

We want to make it clear: Kathleen is ready to fight for the people and our businesses while Maryland Matt is ready to fight for big corporate profits. Where Kathleen has fought to protect public lands, Maryland Matt has fought to make it easier to sell them. And where Kathleen has passed healthcare legislation that is expanding access and saving lives, Maryland Matt wants to strip away health care from hundreds of thousands of Montanans.
That’s why I’m proud to work for a real leader like Kathleen, but if we want to see her in Congress, we need all hands on deck to make it happen.
That’s why I am asking personally: Can you give $25 to support Kathleen’s historic campaign today?
Our operations are funded by grassroots donations from people just like you. Every dollar we get through the door inches us closer to our ultimate goal: winning the General Election.
Help make the difference today,

Team,
The difference between Kathleen and our Republican opponent Maryland Matt Rosendale couldn’t be more different.
Kathleen: Is running to be a true, independent voice in Congress and to work across the aisle to solve the big issues.
Maryland Matt: Is fighting to reach the next rung of the political ladder and toe the national GOP’s line.
Kathleen: Spent much of her life fighting to protect what makes Montana special.
Maryland Matt: Spent his time attacking our public lands and outdoor heritage.
Kathleen: Is ready to get the job done and be the true leader Montana deserves.
Maryland Matt: Is ready to line his own pockets and cater to his special interest donors.
If you want a true champion to lead for Montana in Congress, we need to ensure that Kathleen has the resources to win in November. Will you chip in to help Kathleen Williams be Montana’s next representative?

We’re just one month away from November’s General Election. And there’s still a lot of work we need to do in order to get Kathleen to Congress -- we’re ready to get the job done.
From here on out, we will spend every moment reaching out to Montanans and working with them to build a better state.

Kathleen Williams for Congress
Team,
Today, we’re one month away from November’s General Election.
This election will help determine the future of Montana. While Kathleen continues to fight for small businesses, public lands and protecting our communities’ health and safety, our Republican opponent would rather fight for his insurance donors.
But right now, our race is still neck and neck. We are just 31 days away from the most important elections of our lifetimes. Will you help change the tide of the race and push Kathleen forward with a $15 donation today?

Kathleen is ready to take her years of experience to be Montana’s only voice in the House. But national GOP groups are spending millions of dollars to muddy the waters and make Montana sound more like Washington.
Let’s show them that no dollar amount they throw at us will change this fact of the race: Kathleen is the best choice for our future. Help build our path forward with a $15 donation today.
Thank you,
Blake Thompson

Please be safe and follow CDC guidance during the coronavirus outbreak. As our country works through this difficult time, please join me in reaching out to those in need or who are feeling isolated - we are all in this together.
Right now, Montana is staying true to its commitment to our tribal communities by working with their governments to build a statewide database of missing indigenous persons.
In fact, the database is almost done.
A statewide database is critical in finding missing indigenous persons and stopping the loss of information and life that tribal communities face when one of their own goes missing. The database can help. Thanks to state Rep. Rae Peppers for her tireless work to get the database started.
Because even though indigenous people make up 6.7% of Montana’s population, they account for 26% of our missing person’s cases.
That’s why I’m proud to throw my support behind this effort to help end the cycle of missing and murdered indigenous people. But I want you to join me. Will you add your name to support efforts to advance safety and justice for Montana’s tribal communities?
Thank you for your continued support,
Kathleen Williams

Montanans will cast their ballots by June 2nd for their choice on who will stand in one of the most important elections in decades. And right now, we’re in the best position possible to elect a fighter for Montana.
We have the greatest opportunity to send a real, independent leader to the table where big decisions are made.
We can’t send just another rubber stamp to Congress that will toe the same line Gianforte has. We need a leader who’ll fight for Montana’s outdoor heritage, ensure everyone has access to quality, affordable healthcare and find the best solutions to our biggest challenges -- no matter which party they come from.
Kathleen Williams is that leader.
To make sure we send Kathleen to Congress, we’re launching a $15,000 end-of-month fundraising drive. We have just 8 days until Montana voters cast their ballots. Will you help kick things off by sending in your donation today?
Thanks!

We’re making our last ad purchases before the election and it’s up to us to secure as much airtime as we possibly can in order to reach every voter across Montana.
For months, our opponent has had the support of numerous special interest groups spreading his message through ads they fronted the cash for. And in the process, they jacked up the prices for the rest of us.
But now this is our time to take back the airwaves and get Kathleen’s message out BEFORE mail voting starts tomorrow!

Kathleen’s right, we have a big decision to make in November about who will be the lone voice of Montana in the House.
Do we want it to be an out-of-state developer who used his time in office to climb the rungs of the political ladder and who doesn’t show up for Montanans when they need him?
Or do we want a dedicated public servant and entrepreneur who spent her time expanding health coverage and championing our public education system?
We know what the right answer is. That’s why super PACs are spending millions to prop up Maryland Matt’s campaign over Kathleen. Help us stand against their efforts with a $20.20 donation.

Did you see this?
The Club for Growth, a right-wing dark money group and one of Matt Rosendale’s top DC allies, is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to interfere with Montana’s election. They know that Rosendale would blindly toe the line for special interests like them, while Kathleen is going to be a real representative for Montanans.
It’s clear big dark money groups like Club for Growth will stop at nothing to buy this election. We won’t let them get away with this.

Chip in now to help us catch up with these outrageous efforts to meddle in Montana’s election.

We’re only a few hours away from September, and our campaign still needs $567 to hit our goal before midnight.
When we win the election in November, we’ll be making history. But history takes hard work, and we need your help to make our win possible.
We’ve beaten the odds so far, and I know we’ll keep doing it all the way up to November 3rd if we have you on our side.
This is our final chance to make our goal before August ends. Will you give $10 right now before we hit midnight?
Thank you for the support,

Folks, did you get a chance to look at the latest polling numbers?
We’re ready to change the tide and take the lead against a politician looking to add yet another public office to his resume.
The only way we can build on this momentum is with your support. We need 450 donors to give $10 to help us raise $4,500 for our mid-month fundraising deadline. Will you donate $10 today?

In 2018, Kathleen came the closest in over two decades to unseating an incumbent in Montana. Now in 2020, it’s time to build on the foundation she laid two years ago and finish the job.
We need to fight for the people of Montana in this critical moment, which is exactly what Kathleen will do in Congress!
Will you make a contribution to send real Montana leadership to Congress in this pivotal moment? We have to strike while the race is hot. Donate today if you can.
Thank you,

My name is Heidi Heitkamp, and I proudly represented North Dakota in the U.S. Senate.
Kathleen and I come from similar backgrounds. She understands what good leadership looks like at a community level as a former State Representative, and now she wants to take the voices of Montana with her to Washington as she fights to win her competitive House race.
And I don’t know a better person who truly understands the big issues facing Montana today than Kathleen.
But Kathleen is facing a tough election where polls still show her neck and neck with her Republican opponent. Will you help give her the upper hand before Election Day with a $25 donation?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50

Kathleen understands what rural America needs to thrive. Investments in our infrastructure, providing schools with the funding they need and protecting healthcare are all things Kathleen proudly supports.
But standing in her way are Washington insiders who'd rather prop up her special interest-funded opponent than fight for Montana’s best interests. She needs you to take a stand.
That’s why we all need to chip in if we want to see Kathleen in Congress. The countdown to the election is on. Will you support Kathleen with a $20 donation today?
Thank you,

Kathleen Williams for Congress
Please be safe and follow CDC guidance during the coronavirus outbreak. As our country works through this difficult time, please join me in reaching out to those in need or who are feeling isolated - we are all in this together.
Friends, this Wednesday is Earth Day!
This is an opportunity to reflect on the beauty and value of what makes Montana the Last Best Place and the importance of conservation to the future of our planet.
With 75% of Montanans considering themselves conservationists, we’re a big group.
I’m proud to have fought to protect our land, air, wildlife, soil and waters - our forests, plains and open spaces. When I left Montana's fish and wildlife agency over 15 years ago, I received a plaque saying that Montana's rivers were better off because I cared ""and knew what to do."" That award still means the world to me and represents the approach I'll bring to Congress. It's not just caring; it's doing.
But I need your voice behind me to do this work. Will you stand with 75% of Montanans today by renewing your commitment to protecting our planet?
We all have a responsibility to lighten our footprint on our world. And the numbers who agree are overwhelming:
1. 85% of Montanans believe that companies should pay fees to mine on public lands
2. 67% support full funding to the Land and Water Conservation Fund
3. 84% believe that issues of clean water, clean air, wildlife and public lands are important in determining their support for an elected official
And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. On Earth Day this Wednesday, will you commit to stand with me in protecting the beauty and resources that sustain us all?
Thank you, Happy Earth Day!

Kathleen Williams for Congress
Please be safe and follow CDC guidance during the coronavirus outbreak. As our country works through this difficult time, please join me in reaching out to those in need or who are feeling isolated - we are all in this together.
Your $10 donation today can help us gain an edge in a race that continues to be neck and neck with just months before the general election. Will you pitch in today?
We want to be the campaign that sends real leadership to Washington, but it’ll be a team effort to make that happen.
We need someone in Congress who gets our Montana way of life. Someone who will fight for the small business owner in Billings and the ranchers and farmers in Choteau. And we deserve someone who will protect Medicare for our seniors and prevent predatory, short-term junk insurance plans from being unwittingly sold to working families.
I’m ready to be that leader. Matt Rosendale is not. But his campaign is being propped up by dark money and his insurance special interests. That’s why I need you to chip in $15 today to stop him from buying this election.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50
$100 $250 Other
Right now, this race is still tied. That means anyone can take the lead and run with it. Help us pull ahead!
Maryland Matt is just too out of touch to ever be of service to the people he’s supposed to represent. He’s an out-of-state land developer who doesn’t know our Montana way of life.
I’m ready to show Congress what Montana leadership really looks like -- independent, focused and willing to work with people of all political stripes to get good work done. Will you help me represent the state I love by sending in a donation of any amount right now?
Thank you,

Kathleen Williams for Congress
The latest budget proposal from the administration slashes billions in funding for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Sure, it's a ""blueprint"" but it signals policy-maker intentions.
Millions of Americans -- including many here in Montana -- rely on these programs for health care and even survival.
Will you add your name to join me in calling for no more cuts to Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid?
While some in Washington would rather play politics with our critical programs in order to give tax breaks to billionaires, I’m committed to standing up for everyday, hardworking Montanans.
Sign on to stand with me and tell Congress not to enact these cuts!

Voting in Montana is underway, meaning the General Election is happening right now. We’re running out of time to ensure that Kathleen will get the nod as our lone voice in Congress.
But Matt Rosendale is feeling the pressure. Just last week, he and his dark money allies launched TWO attack ads that lie about Kathleen’s record. The truth? She’s fighting for more affordable healthcare, tax cuts for the middle class and she’s ready to do it in a bipartisan way.
Let’s make sure Matt Rosendale doesn’t get anywhere close to Congress by chipping in $17 to Kathleen’s campaign -- $1 for every day we have left before November 3rd!

Our Montana way of life is at stake in this election. Matt Rosendale is happy to take the voices of his wealthy donors to Congress and turn our state into a playground for Washington elites and developers looking to make a quick buck off our land and our people.
But we can stop that from happening. Chip in any amount today to support Kathleen as we enter into the final days of the election.

Kathleen Williams for Congress
March is Women’s History Month, and this month we get to celebrate the diversity and importance of Montana women.
From Jeannette Rankin to Pretty Shield, Montana women have never backed down from a challenge. Instead, they’re trailblazers who’ve sacrificed to build a better future. Now it’s our turn.
That’s why we need to tell Congress to finalize the call to end gender discrimination. Will you be one of my 200 top supporters to sign on to my newest petition today?
ADD YOUR NAME WITH MINE
When the Equal Rights Amendment was introduced over a century ago, it was seen as radical that women were deciding the future they wanted. But they weren’t fazed and they have carried the fight for equality up to today. And we should be proud that Montana was an early leader, approving the amendment in 1974.
We still have work to do. Congress can’t ignore 200 voices joining together. Add your name to my newest petition and tell Congress we won’t stand for gender discrimination!

These final TV and digital ads will be the LAST ads we’re able to get live before we miss our prime window of opportunity. We only have until the 29th to get TV ads running and only until the 27th to get our online ads across social media.
It’s more expensive than it has ever been to advertise in Montana. Prices are on par with New York advertising rates. That’s why we need to act fast, or miss out on getting Kathleen’s word across the state to undecided voters who will shape the outcome of our tossup race.
We need all hands on deck from our grassroots, small-dollar donors. Can we count on you to chip in $10 to help get our ads live?

Americans for Prosperity just released an ad lying about Kathleen’s record and attacking her efforts to lower taxes for the middle class (not Matt's 1% funders) and fight for real healthcare coverage, not junk insurance plans -- you know, the ones that Matt Rosendale is happy to peddle to struggling families that don’t even cover pre-existing conditions or COVID treatment.
And who’re Americans for Prosperity? A Koch Super PAC determined to turn Montana into the D.C. Swamp.
We need our top supporters to help respond to this newest attack on Kathleen ASAP. Will you help bring in 500 new donations so we can have the resources we need to set, and keep, the record straight?

Team, the clock is ticking down to the final hours of May. Can we get one big last push to our FINAL pre-primary fundraising drive today?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25
$50 $100
$250 Other
It’s crunch time. In these final days, we need to get our message out to as many people as possible before they cast their ballots.
There are thousands of voters still undecided and they will shape the outcome of this election by Tuesday. Every day we’re behind on our fundraising numbers is a missed opportunity to gain more momentum and get new voters on Kathleen’s side.
We’re not done fighting until we know who will be the Democratic nominee for the November election. Let’s close the books on May by bridging the $3,408 gap still left in our fundraising drive.
Thank you,

Kathleen Williams for Congress
We know that there are many bridges we need to continue to build when it comes to closing the urban-rural divide -- including access to health care.
The fact is, many Montanans have to spend hours traveling in order to see a doctor or mental health specialist. In some cases, Montanans live without doctors in their town. Veterans and tribal members often face additional access challenges.
That’s unacceptable.
Ensuring rural health care is more important than ever, and it’s up to us to act. Will you add your name with mine and tell Congress to get to work on improving our patchwork of rural health care?
Improve Rural Health Care!
We must make our voices heard now to work towards ensuring every Montanan across the state has access to affordable and reliable health care. Where we choose to live in Montana shouldn’t determine the quality of care we receive. Kathleen has passed legislation that is saving lives and reducing costs. She is a proven champion for this issue.
Rural health services help keep our communities intact. Join us in demanding solutions.
Add your name now and tell Congress to improve rural health care!
Our communities are depending on us.
Thanks,

Kathleen Williams for Congress
I want to ask you to donate $25 to my campaign right off the success we had during our end-of-quarter fundraising. Here’s why:
We’re entering the final stages of the campaign. Right now, there are only 32 days that stand between us and November 3rd’s General Election.
And in that time, we still have a lot of work to do.
October is our absolute, final month of campaigning. Not only do we need to bring in a budget that will keep the campaign running for the month, but we also need to gather the resources required to get Montanans crucial voting information, our campaign ads in front of as many voters as possible and edge out Maryland Matt in November.
But all those things take big dollars to accomplish. That’s why I’m turning to my grassroots supporters: will you help kick off October right by sending in a $25 donation right now?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50
$100 $250 Other
I’m ready to take my seat in Congress to be the independent voice Montanans deserve. But this year has been a clear reminder of what happens when special-interest funded Super PACs are allowed to take to the airwaves and lie. They’ve done it before, and now they’re doing it for Rosendale.
When I’m elected, Montanans will be sending a powerful message to the Washington establishment that out-of-state phonies have no business representing the interests of our ranchers, farmers, business owners, or our families. Help me make the message one they can’t ignore with your donation today.

Kathleen Williams for Congress
Kathleen Williams isn’t running a campaign like Maryland Matt Rosendale’s and we’re proud of that.
Will you help us spread the word on the differences between the two candidates with a $21 donation?
Unlike her extreme opponent, Kathleen:
1. Fights for tax cuts for the middle class and small business owners -- not massive corporations or the richest 1% who give money to his campaign
2. Puts Montana’s outdoor heritage first and won’t pave the way for privatizing our public lands
3. Is dedicated to public service and won’t use her time in Congress to just climb the political ladder
The difference is night and day. Kathleen will fight for Montana’s best interests in Congress. Matt Rosendale will be fighting for his special interest mega-donors. Let’s make sure we send a real Montana leader to Congress in 13 days with your $21 donation.

We knew that this was going to be a competitive race when Kathleen announced her candidacy to run in a district that Trump won by 21 points in 2016. Today, we have a new poll to prove just how competitive this race is.
The survey from a national polling firm shows Kathleen is statistically TIED with her likely opponent Matt Rosendale here in Montana. Now is the time to keep building momentum and prove that Kathleen will take the lead and win in November.
Will you be one of the 1,500 donors we need to chip in over the next 24 hours to send a clear message that Montana is ready for real Montanan values?
In 2018, Kathleen came the closest in over 20 years to unseating an incumbent in Montana's lone US House seat. Now the numbers are on our side. But we need your help to take the lead.
It’s a serious goal, but we can win in 2020 if we can raise the resources it takes to surpass the dark money special interests working hard to tip the scales.

Kathleen Williams for Congress
We know Washington D.C. is all in for Maryland Matt. This week, Donald Trump Jr. sent an email to Rosendale’s donors attacking Kathleen’s record of building bipartisan solutions to Montana’s biggest issues. Trump Jr. called her a “radical,” most likely because doing right by the people who elect you, and not just your big donors, is a radical idea for Maryland Matt.
See for yourself what they had to say:
* “Both President Donald Trump and I are strong believers in Matt and his campaign.”
* “Montana is a major battleground this election cycle in the House.”
Donald Trump Jr. said it himself -- Montana is a battleground state. Will you help us counter the wave of money he raised from his fundraising email by helping us get 500 Rapid Response Donations TODAY?!

Kathleen knows that good leadership can come from any party, and she also knows that what matters to Montanans are solutions that balance cost with responsibility. All Maryland Matt knows is how to skirt his responsibility and ask his rich friends to fund his next campaign venture for public office.

Kathleen Williams for Congress
We’re just over 24 hours away from our donation match deadline and there are still 65 opportunities left to have your impact on this race doubled.
If we’re going to make history in Montana by DEFEATING Maryland Matt, we need to take advantage of every opportunity we have. Will you make a MATCHED $20 donation right now?
Match Opportunity
This race could be one of the closest in the country. Although rating changes and polling numbers are heading in the right direction for us, anything can change in these final days.
And Maryland Matt has no plans to stop lying about Kathleen and her record.
It’s up to us to ensure we make an impact Matt Rosendale can’t ignore. Will Kathleen and I see your $20 donation before tomorrow’s deadline?
Thanks,
Jeff Allen

I’m doing my part to help candidates across Montana and the country meet and exceed their final end-of-quarter fundraising goals. But I can’t make that happen without your help. Will you chip in $25 to help Kathleen meet her $35,000 goal before September 30th?
CHIP IN $20.20 HERE
We’re seeing history in the making. Kathleen has the best chance of flipping Montana’s House seat in decades. Montanans are realizing she's the kind of leader that they deserve representing their best interests.
Kathleen has the experience. She has the support. And now she just needs the boost in fundraising from her grassroots team to make it past the finish line.
Chip in whatever you can to help Kathleen hit her final, end-of-quarter goal before November’s election. We still have a long road to the election and Kathleen is depending on you to help make the journey a successful one.

We wanted to tell you why we’re supporting Kathleen for Congress in 2020. This current public health and the economic challenge have proven that we need a leader like Kathleen who can reach across the aisle to get work done.
1. Kathleen is our best chance to send a REAL representative to Congress who’ll fight for us.
2. Kathleen has years of service under her belt. From serving in the statehouse to fighting to protect our clean water, economy, and public lands.
3. Kathleen is the only person who can bring people of all political stripes together to build REAL solutions -- she’s already done it for decades across Montana and the West.
And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. If you’re like us and are ready for a real champion for Montana, send in $20 to help the team reach their $20,000 goal.

Kathleen Williams for Congress
The President’s recent budget proposal eliminates funding for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, meaning that dedicated firefighters, police, social workers, teachers, and nonprofit workers across the country will lose the chance to have portions of their student loans forgiven.
This program was started under President Bush and helps encourage needed workers in places like rural Montana. We need tools to encourage nurses, teachers, and counselors, for example, to our small communities.
This is just one more example of Washington not understanding Montana's needs. But Kathleen does. Add your name to stand with her!
SIGN ON WITH KATHLEEN
Kathleen is taking a stand to demand we have the tools to deliver on incentives for rural public service. This program needs to be fixed, not eliminated!
If you’re with her, and with the next generation of students willing to start their careers in places like Chinook, or Lame Deer, or Broadus, add your name now!
Thanks,

20 Days Left
We’re in the final stages of our campaign to send Kathleen to Washington.
With early voting already underway, the election has officially kicked off in Montana. But at that same time, Kathleen’s Republican opponent has upped his lies about her record and has made it clear who he’ll fight for in Congress -- his insurance industry backers.
That’s why we need to keep pushing on all the way up to November 3rd. Will you keep our campaign running strong with a $20 donation -- $1 for every day until the election.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$10 $25 $50
$100 $250 Other
What we do in this final stretch will be the build-up to whether or not we win or lose. Montanans are ready for a new kind of leadership - the kind that we know Kathleen will bring to Washington.
We’re the closest we’ve been to winning this election, but things are far from over. Chip in $20 right away and let’s do what Montanans do best: get the job done.
Thank you,

Fall will be the busiest time for our campaign and we are quickly running out of time to expand our reach and make sure we have the best chance we possibly can to make sure Kathleen wins.
48 days is all we have to help Kathleen gain an advantage over her far-right opponent in the polls.
48 days is all we have to reach out to independent and undecided voters who will be the deciding factor in this election.
And we only have 48 days to plan out ads, communication strategies and all the new digital programs we’re implementing to keep our communities safe. We have even fewer days until mail-in ballots go out and Montanans start voting!
That’s why tomorrow’s mid-month goal is critical to ensuring we’re using every minute we have to win this election and make history. Will you give $20 to help us reach our goal before tomorrow’s deadline?

Last night was night we showed this state that when Patriots work together, we are unstoppable!
We managed to break the 30% threshold required to avoid a runoff, and had a clear victory with 32.5% of the vote!
Thank you to every single person that helped us out. Whether you donated, knocked on doors, made phone calls were a social media warrior, worked the polls, put out signs, or did something else, it is because of you that we are victorious!
As we celebrate our victory, we must prepare for November. This election will be a clear choice between our campaign: A movement that protects life, our 2nd Amendment, that wants to end indoctrination in our schools, set the gold standard for veterans care, stand up for our law enforcement, and defend the integrity of our votes with voter ID, and the Democrats who are pro- abortion, against voter ID, and want to indoctrinate our children with ideas about transgenderism.
We are going to have a challenge ahead of us as we turn to November, and we are going to need Patriots that will join us!
Please donate $32, $320, or $3,200 today in honor of getting 32% last night so that we can show the Democrats that we are ready for November!

Thanks,

Today marks exactly one week since our historic victory in the primary. Since that time we have done dozens of interviews and received calls from a multitude of elected officials and groups that want to help us.
However there are a few different numbers from this last week that stand out to me the most:
* 5,000 people who have liked our Facebook page
* 200,000 individuals that have watched my victory speech
* 1,000 advocates that have signed up on our website
* 354 Patriots who have given money to our movement since last Tuesday
* 1 successful campaign!
Although this last week has been incredible, we cannot rest on our laurels. Democrats are going to spend big money on this race.
We need your help to make sure that we win in November. Please consider giving $10, $25, $50, $100, or more to help us build our resources for November!
Thank you again to everyone that was with us during the primary, and welcome to those that are joining us now! Together we will be victorious in November!

Alex,
Exactly 8 months ago we launched our campaign. When we started we had no email lists, no money, and no social media.
What we did have was a strong message and a plan for a campaign unlike any other.
Eight months later, we have raised up a grass roots army. We have visited counties that are typically ignored by candidates, and have listened to voters as we travel. We have been end to end of North Carolina, from the mountains of Cherokee county, to the beaches of Dare.
We have have developed a monster of a campaign. We have received contributions from more individuals than all of our opponents combined, traveled to more counties and held more events than any other campaign, have led in every single straw poll, and have determined the big issues of this race.
Since the beginning, Mark has called this campaign a movement, and it truly has been. We have seen people coming out to vote for him who have not cast ballots in decades, activated voters who wouldn't have traditionally listened to a Republican candidate, and have inspired thousands of people to get active, making calls, knocking on doors, and getting involved in their communities.
This campaign has been fueled by people like you, and I want to thank you for all of your hard work. Even as I type this email we have dozens of volunteers talking to voters waiting in line at the Trump rally in Charlotte. It is because of efforts like this that tomorrow we will be victorious.
Patriots, thank you. Let's finish strong.

* Volunteers in all 100 counties

We are just one week away from the big night. At this time next week, the polls will close and we will see the first batch of results.
But this race isn't finished quite yet! With most people expected to vote on election day, we still have a lot of work to do, and we need your help!
As we enter the last six days of the campaign, we need everyone to make a final push. A donation of $10 can help us reach up to 1,000 voters. A donation of $100 allows us to reach up to 10,000!
Our grass roots campaign is made up of thousands of Patriots who have contributed, shared our message on Facebook, hosted events, knocked on doors, and handed out materials at the polls. We cannot thank you enough for your efforts, and it's because of these efforts that we will be victorious!
I want to encourage everyone in this last week to keep pushing. Give a few more dollars, get a few more of your friends to vote, work the polls just a little longer, and soon we will be celebrating together!
Thank you so much for all of your efforts, let's finish strong.

Alex,
Right now our state is going through a time of hardship, the left is choosing to use this crisis as a chance to push their political agenda. We need your help!
* WE MUST stand up for the unborn.
* WE MUST defend the 2nd Amendment.
* WE MUST educate and not indoctrinate.
* WE MUST stand up for law enforcement.
* WE MUST enact voter I.D.
* WE MUST be the ""Gold Standard"" in veterans care.
The left wants to restrict your constitutional rights. They want more government intervention, and limit the power of we the people. We must stop them and we cannot do it without YOU!
We have momentum in this election, and now is not the time to rest. Democrats are going to spend big money on this race.
We need your help to make sure that we win in November. Please consider giving $10, $25, $50, $100, or more to help us build our resources for November!
Together we will be victorious in November!

Election day is less than 4 weeks away and I have good news.... we have the momentum!
Today I visited six more counties on our statewide tour, marking our 72nd stop so far!
As we travel we have met THOUSANDS of Patriots, some of whom have not voted in recent elections, but have joined our movement.
As March 3rd gets closer, we continue to pick up momentum, but our opponents are putting big money in this race, copying the strategies of liberal billionaires like Tom Steyer and Bloomberg. They are trying to buy this election! Our campaign is fueled by grass roots, and we have more individual donors than all of our opponents combined.
We need your help to get our message out. Contribute $10, $25, $50, or $100 to help us tell people why we need Patriots, not Politicians!

Alex,
We are at the beginning of May, and moving quickly towards November. Let's make history by electing Patriots over Politicians.
The issues we address in this upcoming election will dictate the future of our great state. We've seen what politicians like our current governor have done: Vetoing the Born Alive Bill, refusing to sign a budget that includes teacher pay raises, and keeping our state on lock down as businesses struggle and our unemployment rate skyrockets. We must demand change!
I will fight for North Carolina. As a fellow Patriot I have stood with you at the rallies to reopen our state, fought against the left to defend our 2nd Amendment rights, and stood up for the unborn.
As Lt. Governor, I will continue to fight for you. I will work to bring a proper education to North Carolina. Ending indoctrination in our classrooms, ending common core in our state, and elevate the core foundations of; reading, writing, and arithmetic back into early childhood education.
We can achieve great things in this election, but we need you. Anything you can donate $10, $20, $50, $100. Together, let's make history for the state of North Carolina.

Alex,
We are near the end of April, and the general election is in full swing. Your support is crucial now more than ever.
The left is using this virus to push their political agenda. We must stand up to them and their radical agenda of picking winners and losers in business, trampling on the Constitution, and using this crises to push for corrupt election practices.
Here in North Carolina the left has chosen to close our churches while leaving abortion clinics open. They consider ABC stores and vape shops essential while small businesses like barbers are shutdown because they are ""non-essential"".
In D.C. we see the left trying to fund items completely unrelated to the crises instead of passing financial aid packages for small businesses. The left is more interested in playing political games than helping out millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet.
The voices, and the values held dear by North Carolinians must be heard. It is time to take a stand against the left in Raleigh and DC.
Please stand with us by giving $5, $10, $20, $50, $100. We can't do this without you.

“Sara Jacobs (CA-53) self-funds House campaign to the tune of $4.3 million”
\-- San Diego Reader, April 22nd
* * *
Friend --
As we close in on the end of April, and our end-of-month fundraising deadline, we wanted to reach out and make sure you had the latest updates on our race.
We'll start with the bad news: Our opponent's quarterly fundraising report just went public, which means we got a jarring look at what we're up against. Sara Jacobs collected over $5 million for her campaign. $4.3 million of that total came from her own pocketbook.
But there is some good news: Our campaign has more donors. A lot more.
In fact, 11,120 people contributed to our campaign, and the vast majority of those donors chipped in small donations of $5, $35, and $100. That helped us report a very respectable $1.3 million.
Our opponent may have deep pockets, but we're building a people-powered movement made up of thousands of supporters who are ready to deliver progressive change in Congress. We’ll take that any day.
We fully expect our opponent to pick up the pace, which means we have no chance against all that spending unless we pick up the pace, too:
Friend, we’re humbly asking if you can add a donation of any amount to help us meet our end-of-month fundraising goal. We wouldn’t ask if this wasn’t crucial to our campaign.
If you've save your information with ActBlue Express, your contribution will be processed immediately.

Friend,
We have LESS THAN 100 DAYS to win this campaign and to send a real champion for progressive change to Congress.
As we get closer and closer to Election Day, our campaign will be seriously ramping up our fundraising efforts to make sure we elect Georgette this November.
For too long, we've seen a Congress nervous to take bold action, implementing piecemeal changes that create just a small ripple in our country.
Not anymore.
We finally have the chance to see robust, comprehensive reform across the board. Whether it's environmental justice, social justice, criminal justice reform, or Medicare for All -- we are constantly told change is coming, but we don't ever see it.
That is going to change when we elect Georgette -- but we need to put in the work to make sure she's our next Congresswoman.
With less than 100 days from Election Day, we need your support more than ever. Can you chip in towards our end-of-month fundraising goal today?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

While we're working hard to earn your grassroots support, remember that our opponent is busy trying to buy the election -- but not us. Never us.
This seat will be earned vote by vote, grassroots dollar by grassroots dollar raised. And when we win, this seat will have been earned because of Georgette's progressive stance on the issues that impact our district the most.
We have an ambitious goal of $15,000 to raise by the end of the month -- can you chip in?
Thank you for your continued dedication and support.
Together, we'll win this thing.

Friend,
48 years ago today, the Clean Water Act became a U.S. federal law.
This was a landmark piece of legislation -- one that finally pushed states to address pollution and provide crucial funding for wetland protection.
The passage of this law was a win for our nation and a necessary step towards a cleaner, more sustainable future.
We must continue to act NOW. We are still in the midst of an urgent climate crisis \-- one that requires immediate action, otherwise we will lose the planet we all depend on for life.
I've been an advocate for environmental justice my entire career -- and my time as a community organizer has shown me that real change requires meaningful action.
We are facing an emergency of unimaginable proportions -- and we need leaders in Congress who will make this a priority. Will you chip in $5 or anything you can to help me combat climate change in Congress?

Greenhouse gas emissions are at an all-time high, glaciers and ice sheets are melting faster than ever, rising sea levels are posing a serious threat to coastal cities, and natural disasters are proving more frequent and destructive.
Not to mention, communities of color are disproportionately impacted by these dangers. I've seen the intersection between racial and environmental issues first-hand while growing up in Barrio Logan -- where the air is polluted and asthma became a pervasive problem. The playground I went to as a kid was under a highway, where cars zoomed by emitting harmful fumes. No kid should be put at risk of long-term health conditions.
That's why I served as an associate director for the Environmental Health Coalition, where I helped drive toxic industries out of local neighborhoods. As president of the City Council, I am spearheading the implementation of San Diego's Climate Action Plan -- which puts our city on a path to 100% clean energy.
In Congress, I'll continue to fight tirelessly on climate change to get the Green New Deal passed, so we can tackle the climate crisis head-on while creating millions of clean energy jobs.
Please, rush a donation of $5 or anything you can to help me push these comprehensive solutions at the federal level before it's too late.

You deserve a representative who will be a champion for a more sustainable future, and my commitment to you is exactly that.
Let's go out and win this thing, friend.

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,Servant leadership,"Glad I caught you, friend.
I wanted to give you a quick update on our campaign’s fundraising efforts before the books close on our mid-quarter fundraising push. Right now, we’re only $1,026 away from our goal -- which means we only need 38 more supporters to step up with a donation before midnight.
Can you chip in $3 to put us over the top?
I say this a lot, but I truly can’t thank you enough for your support.
A lot has changed over the last few weeks. Rather than our normal door-to-door canvassing and phone banking, we've taken this campaign online, and have spent more time checking in on our elderly neighbors than doing traditional voter outreach.
This team is meeting the moment, and I’m hopeful that the kind of servant leadership I’ve seen from each one of you won’t end once we emerge from this crisis.
I'm more committed than ever to this fight for working families, and if your commitment over the last couple months is any indication, I know that you’ll have my back through thick and thin.
Before the clock strikes midnight, please make a donation to help us hit this mid-quarter goal and enter the next phase of our campaign with strength.
Thank you — from the bottom of my heart.

Hi friend,
Georgette here -- and I’m writing to let you know that we’re facing our final, our biggest, and our most important fundraising deadline of the entire election cycle.
Our numbers will be published by the FEC for everyone to see. People are always going to talk -- especially when an unconventional candidate like myself is running head-to-head with a self-funder. So, let’s give them something to talk about.

Let’s show the country what type of candidates is able to win in 2020. I’m not a career politician. I didn’t expect to run for office. Growing up a low-income, first-gen Mexican American working multiple jobs to put food on the table -- people like me don’t usually end up in politics.
But here I am. And I’m here thanks to you.
Every retweet and Facebook share, every virtual town hall, every lawn sign, and every donation, no matter how big or small, has shown me that we can make history. I could be the first LGBTQ Latina in Congress -- thanks to you.
Together, we can show everyone that we can win this -- but I need your help. Rush in $5 or anything you can to this campaign so we can take our fight to Congress!

Quick update, team.
Right now, San Diego-based hospitals are preparing for coronavirus cases to spike in the next month. One local health care provider described it as an imminent and “slow-moving tsunami.”
Local hospitals are also running out of medical equipment like surgical masks and ventilators. This shortage of protective gear is a rapidly deepening crisis, not only in San Diego, but nationwide. The images of nurses wearing trash bags or worse, stories of nurses dying because of unnecessary exposure, are simply unconscionable.
Please sign our petition and call on Congress to ensure nurses have the essential protective equipment they so desperately need to reduce their exposure to COVID-19. Tell Congress: Protect our Nurses!There are more than 30,000 registered nurses in San Diego, which means there’s a good chance you know someone -- a friend, neighbor, family member -- who is still working and saving lives during this crisis.
The folks who are working day and night to save as many people as possible shouldn’t have to put their lives at risk too.
Sign on: Join nurses across San Diego and the country calling for immediate support from Congress.
Thanks for your support,
Georgette
Tell Congress: Protect our Nurses!

Team,
We emailed you on Friday to let you know our opponent's family super PAC just dropped $841,000 into this race for a TV ad buy in October.
To go up against that kind of family money, we set an end-of-month fundraising goal of $10,000 to meet by midnight TONIGHT!
We're just $2,957 short of our end-of-month goal -- no matter how big or small, your donation takes us a long way.
We just need 3 more donors from 92176 to chip in by midnight tonight to get us to our goal.
Can you pitch in $5 or anything you can to Georgette Gómez for Congress to help us meet our end-of-month fundraising goal by MIDNIGHT TONIGHT?

It's no secret that Georgette's heiress opponent has unlimited resources in this race (she just purchased a huge slot of TV time on top of the $841,000 her grandparents dropped in their super PAC to buy her this seat). But what she doesn't realize is that our community is bigger than money. The people are bigger than money -- and Georgette is the people's candidate.
That's why it's the people of the community that have to come together to elect Georgette. We've seen what Georgette has done already -- from leading the “Toxic-Free Neighborhood” campaign to her unanimous appointment of President of the City Council, we know she's a leader of the people from our community.
Huge sums of family money have no place in politics. And we certainly won't let this seat be bought.
There are only 64 days until the election -- and we've got to get serious.
Chip in before midnight TONIGHT to help get Georgette elected to Congress this November -- because she's a candidate of the people through and through.

Hello friend --
It has been a whirlwind few days on the campaign trail. With election day right around the corner, I wanted to take a moment and update you directly about what’s going on in our campaign.
But first, I’d like to start by saying thank you.
It means the world to me to have your confidence, and I’m proud to say that this campaign has been a community-led effort from the very start. Thanks to you, we are heading into Election Day with strength and momentum behind our campaign to enact meaningful, progressive change for our communities and our working families.
I’m also so proud that we’ve been able to build an incredibly broad coalition behind our campaign. Our endorsements include:
\- The California Democratic Party (We’re the only official nominee)
\- The California Federation of Teachers
\- The California Labor Federation
\- The California Nurses Association
We’ve picked up support from national progressive figures:
\- Senator Bernie Sanders
\- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
\- Rep. Pramilla Jayyapal
\- Rep. Ro Khanna
We also have support from local elected leaders:
\- State Senator Toni Atkins
\- Assemblymember Shirley Weber
\- Assemblymember Todd Gloria
\- Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez
\- County Supervisor Nathan Fletcher
\- National City Mayor Alejandra Sotelo-Solis
\- Councilmember Barbara Bry
\- Councilmember Monica Montgomery… and many more
To view our full list of endorsers, click here >>
We’re two days from Election Day, and there are still ways you can help our campaign:
1\. Volunteer and help us turn out voters. We are calling voters and knocking doors around the clock until polls close. This is probably the most impactful action you can take to make sure we emerge victorious. Join us here.
2\. Vote! Make sure that you, and everybody you know, submits their ballots as soon as possible or gets to the polls before they close on Tuesday March 3rd. For information on voting, click here.
3\. Spread the word. Forward this email to five or more friends and family that live in the area. Explain why you are supporting my campaign, and direct them to my website for more information about my policies and experience.
4\. Share your story. Spread the word about our campaign on Facebook and Twitter, and be sure to tell your story about why you are supporting our campaign.
I’m ready to deliver for this community -- on universal health care, ending the climate crisis, housing, comprehensive immigration reform, and so much more. But I cannot do this alone. Taking our locally-grown, progressive vision to Washington is going to require this whole community coming together.
Thank you for your vote, and for helping us make history in our San Diego community.

Team,
We wanted to give you a brief rundown on what our opponent is up to:
FIRST: She released an attack ad comparing our campaign's tactics to President Trump's -- an offensive, out-of-line attack.
THEN: Within days of our opponent's ad coming out, the ""independent"" super PAC funded by her billionaire grandparents released a different attack ad full of misinformation about Georgette's record.
NOW: With just 13 days left until the election, we need to set the record straight and remind voters why Georgette deserves to be the next congresswoman for CA-53.
Georgette won't buy this seat. She will earn each and every vote, and every day, she'll work to keep earning those votes by enacting bold, progressive policies that will improve our health care, our climate, our schools, and more.

GeorgetteGomez.org,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,UPDATE: We just posted a STRONG fundraising quarter. ,"#
Huge news, team:
We just finished tallying up our fundraising numbers from the first three months of 2020. We’re happy to announce that we raised $460,000 -- our best quarterly fundraising effort to date!
The best part is that it's all thanks to you! Here are some highlights:
✓ 11,120 - Total number of individual donors who gave to our campaign.
✓ $12.26 - Our average online contribution from emails like this one.
✓ $0 - Amount of cash raised from corporate PACs.
We're also proud that 95% of our contributions came from individual donors chipping in less than $200. That’s huge. And it's a testament to the broad and unified grassroots coalition that Georgette is building.
We’re so grateful for your support, but the hard truth is we were still out-raised by our opponent Sara Jacobs. As you may know, she is self-funding a significant portion of her campaign (82%). Her billionaire grandparents also spent $1.5 million on her behalf through a super PAC in the primary election. We expect even more will come in the general.
If we're going to overcome our opponent’s millions, we'll need to keep the momentum up. Can you contribute $3 today to help Georgette win in CA-53?
If you've save your information with ActBlue Express, your contribution will be processed immediately.

We never expected an easy road in our fight to bring progressive change to our San Diego community. And we know that some political insiders are already counting us out due to our opponent's cash advantage.
But as we kick off our General Election push, we do so confidently -- and it's because we know we can count on your support.
Thanks for being a part of this,

Mid-quarter fundraising goal: $10,000
Raised: $5,119 Donate
* * *
I'll be direct, friend.
Friday at midnight marks the mid-way point of the current fundraising quarter, but we are falling short of our goal. Can you pitch in right away to help us hit this mark so we can prepare for the months ahead?
I didn’t take the typical path to public office.
Growing up in Barrio Logan, I had the privilege of being born in this country, but my parents did not. I saw how much they struggled in a system that was stacked against them. Working multiple jobs. At times, we couldn't even afford rent.
But we made the most of it, and it was that experience which led me to become a community organizer — working on environmental justice and land use decisions. It's what motivated me to run for office and become the first queer Latina elected to the San Diego City Council. And it's why I’m taking the next step running for Congress.
I know it won’t be easy now -- especially as we grapple with the coronavirus outbreak. But I know this community is ready for meaningful change to expand affordable housing, end poverty, achieve environmental justice, and ensure health care access for all.
And with that, I must ask:
I'm up against a big mid-quarter fundraising deadline on Friday, and right now we’re falling short. Can I count on you to contribute $3 to help us pick up the pace? I wouldn’t reach out like this if it wasn't important. If you've save your information with ActBlue Express, your contribution will be processed immediately.

75 Latinas have won their primaries across the country in their congressional races in the United States -- including our own Georgette Gómez, who would be the first LGBTQ Latina elected in Congress.
As Georgette said on MSNBC last weekend: ""We can't be what we can't see. If we're not at the table making sure we are shaping policies that are impacting our communities, then the conversations are not being had. This country has left our brown and Black communities behind.""
We can make history here in CA-53 -- but we won't just be making history, we'll be breaking down barriers for the future.
Let's make this possibility a reality -- watch Georgette on MSNBC and chip in to her history-making campaign for Congress today.

GeorgetteGómezfor Congress,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,The REAL Sara Jacobs,"#
Friend,
Who is Georgette's opponent, Sara Jacobs, really?
She's a millionaire heiress, currently spending millions of her family's tech fortune to buy her way into Congress -- for the second time! She couldn't buy her way past Congressmen Mike Levin in CA-49 in 2018, so she's trying again in CA-53.
Her FEC report shows that over 86% of the more than $5 million her campaign has spent has come from her trust fund. Her wealthy family is pumping huge amounts of money into her campaign -- an advantage that our grassroots, people-funded campaign doesn't have.
We have less than two weeks until Election Day, and we have to fundraise as much as possible so Georgette can keep up against her opponent's billionaire family fund. Will you chip in $5 or more today to help get us there?

Here's another fact about our opponent: Sara Jacobs supports Trump's tax cuts for corporations (the same corporations she's invested in!) that have made billions in the pandemic while ripping off families and laying off workers.
In contrast, Georgette knows we must repeal Trump's disastrous handouts to the wealthy which have benefitted no one but the super rich.
And in Congress, she will work against big money interests that try to influence politics for their own agenda. Instead, she'll advocate for the rest of us -- working families who are struggling to pay their bills, who need affordable housing and health care right now.
That's because Georgette Gómez stands for us, the working people of San Diego -- not the billionaire class. And that fighter is who we need in Congress.
If you want to see Georgette win this year and prove to everyone that you don't need a massive trust fund or corporate backers to win an election, contribute $5 or what you can to support our campaign today.
Thanks for your support, together we'll send Georgette to Congress to fight for the people who need it most.

Friend,
October is here, and that means Halloween is coming up. But what's even spookier? Election Day is in exactly 1 month from today.
When we emailed you at the 2-month mark, we had just learned about our opponent's huge amount of spending -- like the $841,000 she and her family put towards TV ads this month alone.
Now we're at the 1-month mark, and our opponent has yet to shy away from the big spending. With just 1 month left, we've got to fundraise as much as possible.
Not only that, but our opponent just released her tax returns. Her family wealth has given her the ability to pump huge sums of money into her campaign, and at over 300 pages, who knows what tax breaks can be found in her returns.
As we saw this week, Trump's tax records show he paid just $750 in federal taxes in 2017, and he paid no taxes for 15 years prior.
Once again, the wealthiest people in our country stay wealthy by working through tax loopholes that only benefit the 1%.
Most Americans have paid more in federal income taxes than Trump. Our tax system is set up to benefit the wealthy and keep money in their hands -- and Trump's presidency has allowed this rigged system to grow stronger.
It's time to prove that politics is for the people and by the people -- chip in $5 or whatever you can to our people's campaign today >>

As a people-powered, people-funded campaign, we could really use your support.
We can't match our opponent's spending, but we can raise enough to keep delivering this campaign's message to voters. When they know our message, we earn their support and their vote.
A grassroots campaign by the people is how politics should be \-- not by billionaires. Not by special interests. Not by corporate money or PACs -- but by the people.
Most people aren't born into rich families. Very few people have the resources to go to an Ivy League or to climb the political totem pole. So many people can barely afford their health insurance, the number one reason people are in debt in this country.
As someone who had a tough upbringing, I know how exhausting it is seeing the rich get richer. As an honest taxpayer, seeing the loopholes the rich use to exploit the working class to expand their bank accounts is why I'm in this fight with you.
A person's financial status should not determine their worth in society. We must work to close tax loopholes to make sure the wealthiest people are paying their fair share.
Friend, that's why we've got to keep the momentum up for this grassroots campaign until November 3rd.
That's why I'm reaching out for your help. Can you chip in today to make sure we can take our grassroots movement all the way to Congress?

Getting so close to Election Day is nerve wracking, but at the end of the day, I'm beyond grateful to be on this journey with you.

Team,
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren all agree: They need Georgette fighting alongside them in Congress.
That's because Georgette has spent her entire career fighting to better the lives of Californians.
Once she's elected to Congress, she will keep fighting to make health care a human right, address the housing crisis, work to fix our broken immigration system, and advocate to pass a Green New Deal.
She will advance policies that will uplift our community members every day.
On November 3rd, Georgette stands to join these incredible change-makers. We are one-third of the way to reaching our end-of-month goal of $75,000. Can you pitch in $5 to send Georgette to Congress?

When we first started this campaign a few months ago, we could not have imagined the incredible support this movement would receive. Our campaign's message is powerful -- and people across the country have taken notice.
Dolores Huerta, a champion of civil rights, women's rights, workers' rights, and immigrants' rights said of Georgette: ""She is going to be out there working for everybody in San Diego -- especially the working people -- so we need Georgette in the Congress.""
The California Democratic Party, along with labor unions at local, state, and national levels have also endorsed Georgette.
Now more than ever, we need a progressive leader who will fight for the issues concerning our district.
That leader is Georgette.
She will be a fighter for progressive legislation in Congress, but first she needs to get there, and she can't do it without your support. Will you chip in today?

Friend,
Last week, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away after a lifetime of serving her country and advocating for justice.
Today, Donald Trump announced his latest nominee for the Supreme Court.
She is anti-choice. Anti-Affordable Care Act. Anti-LGBTQ rights. You won’t believe this one: anti-Brown v. Board of Education, the ruling that desegregated our schools.
This is bad, team.
We need to fight back, and we need to fight back NOW. In Congress, I will work tirelessly to stop Mitch McConnell and Republican leaders from unfairly appointing a Supreme Court Justice. Chip in $5 or anything you can today >>

The hypocrisy of Republican leadership is astounding. The power that special interests, private insurance companies, and big businesses have in our country is astronomical, and with the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett, their power will grow stronger.
Not to mention the risks to our rights as women, as people of color, as members of the LGBTQ community, as people with pre-existing conditions, as workers, as HUMAN BEINGS.
Every day until the election, we need to do all that we can to stop this appointment. And as soon as I'm in Congress, I'll fight tooth-and-nail to make sure no extremist nominee ever makes it on to the Supreme Court. Chip in today.
Thanks for stepping up. This is too important to sit back on the sidelines.

Friend,
On this day, and every day, we honor achievements of our ancestors in the workforce who helped us secure fair wages, hours, and treatment by employers.
That work is never done -- our labor unions continue to fight for these rights.
Now more than ever, we need to celebrate and support our friends in labor. From the teachers going the extra mile to get students ready for distance learning, to the nurses taking care of our family and friends during a global pandemic, all the way to the essential workers who have made sure our store shelves are stocked and our take-out food is ready for pick up -- we owe so much to our workers.
In Congress, I have bold policy plans to make sure our workers get relief in the aftermath of this pandemic, to develop hazard pay for first responders, healthcare employees, and sanitation workers who are on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to repair our country's crumbling infrastructure.
Working hand-in-hand with our friends in unions, we will create a better working environment for millions of workers -- which will make our country better for us all.
So today, thank a member of a union for their hard work and dedication.
With love,
Georgette

Friend --
You’ve been an incredible supporter of my campaign, so I wanted you to be the first to know that we have formed a National Finance Committee tasked with helping our campaign raise the resources we need to win in CA-53.
Some of our leading co-chairs include State Senate President Toni Atkins, former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, and former State Senator Chris Kehoe.
As you’ve probably guessed, fundraising has been especially difficult lately. That problem is only compounded by the fact that our opponent is self-funding a significant portion of her campaign (82%).
We have a tall task ahead of us, but I’m humbled that these leaders, and many others, are coming together and digging deep to help us run a well-funded, winning campaign.
Of course, your continued support is going to be instrumental in our efforts too, friend. Money is not everything -- but it will matter in our race. And every dollar we raise increases our ability to share my progressive message far and wide.
To help us build momentum, I’m humbly asking if you can add a contribution of $3 to help us pick up our fundraising pace. Believe me when I say that every single donation will make a difference.
Thank you — from the bottom of my heart.

Friend --
I'm reaching today because we’re exactly one week away from our first -- and possibly most important -- FEC deadline of our General Election campaign.
As it stands, we’re pacing behind our fundraising goal and need grassroots support to pick up the speed.
Can you chip in a contribution of $3 to get us back on track before our June 30 deadline?
I have to admit, asking people to contribute to my campaign hasn't been at the top of my list lately. I've been so focused on city work -- whether it’s our continued efforts to address the health and economic impact of COVID-19, or implementing new policies like an independent commission to ensure oversight over our police force.
But missing this goal could potentially be devastating for our campaign.
As you probably know, I was outspent 4:1 by my self-funding opponent and the super PAC aligned with her campaign. Another nameless super PAC spent hundreds of thousands on illegal and unmarked mailers promoting a Republican candidate in my race to manipulate the vote count and box me out of the General Election.
Despite all that, we made it through anyway, friend. And that's because supporters like you stood with us. Right now, I need you to stand with me once again before this deadline hits:
Will you make a $3 contribution to my campaign for Congress? Help me send a message that we're ready to overcome the odds and advance real progressive change in CA-53.

I'll be direct, friend.
Friday at midnight marks the mid-way point of the current fundraising quarter, but we are falling short of our goal. Can you pitch in right away to help us hit this mark so we can prepare for the months ahead?
I didn’t take the typical path to public office.
Growing up in Barrio Logan, I had the privilege of being born in this country, but my parents did not. I saw how much they struggled in a system that was stacked against them. Working multiple jobs. At times, we couldn't even afford rent.
But we made the most of it, and it was that experience which led me to become a community organizer — working on environmental justice and land use decisions. It's what motivated me to run for office and become the first queer Latina elected to the San Diego City Council. And it's why I’m taking the next step running for Congress.
I know it won’t be easy now -- especially as we grapple with the coronavirus outbreak. But I know this community is ready for meaningful change to expand affordable housing, end poverty, achieve environmental justice, and ensure health care access for all.
And with that, I must ask:
I'm up against a big mid-quarter fundraising deadline on Friday, and right now we’re falling short. Can I count on you to contribute $3 to help us pick up the pace? I wouldn’t reach out like this if it wasn't important. If you've save your information with ActBlue Express, your contribution will be processed immediately.

Friend,
This Wednesday marks our final end of quarter deadline of the entire election. Whether we meet our fundraising goal of $50,000 or not could quite literally make or break the campaign.
Here’s what we’ve got on file with your email address for our official FEC filing:
OFFICIAL 2020 SUPPORTER RECORD

Email: [[EMAIL_REDACTED]]
2020 Donor Status: NOT YET
Suggested Action: Make your first donation RIGHT NOW
We know how ambitious a $50,000 end of quarter goal is for a grassroots campaign like this one.
But, what’s also ambitious is Georgette’s unconventional campaign. A first-generation American. A community organizer. A grassroots, zero-PAC, 100%-people-funded campaign up against a self-funded heiress. A person who’s set to be the first LGBTQ Latina in Congress.
The top 1% of this country doesn’t represent the rest of us. They don’t represent people like Georgette, and they don’t represent people like all of us. The working class. The teachers. Our food-service workers. Our firemen and women. The college student with a truckload of student debt.
We need someone in our corner. We need you, friend.
That’s why Georgette’s been working tirelessly to get to Congress, because she knows what it’s like to not have her voice heard.
Help us reach our ambitious $50,000 fundraising goal here by chipping in whatever you can to Georgette’s campaign -- because we need someone like her in our corner.

Friend, we'll get straight to the point.
Right now, we're about 63% of the way to our $10,000 mid-quarter fundraising goal. With the deadline set to hit tonight, that's further behind than we expected to be. The good news is we still have time to catch up:
If two supporters from 92176 chip in right now, we’ll be back on track to hitting our goal.
Will you be one of the two donors we need from 92176 to chip in before tonight's deadline? Any amount will go a long way.
Donate $3
We can't afford to come up short on tonight’s goal. Here are a couple of reasons why:
1\. We need to pick up our voter outreach efforts. We're picking up our phone-banking and texting programs. We also need to ramp up communication via mailers and digital advertising. That costs money!
2\. Our opponent is self-funding her campaign to the tune of several million. That's not an attack. That's not a smear. It's a fact. Our opponent spent $4.3 million getting through the primary and is poised to spend even more in the General. That doesn't include the millions being spent by the super PAC supporting her.
We have a huge opportunity to elect a progressive unifier in CA-53, but it depends on hitting these benchmarks. And since we’re refusing support from corporate PACs, we can't do this without your help:
Please chip in whatever you can to help us reach our $10,000 mid-quarter goal.
DonateThanks for your support!

WATCH OUR NEW AD: Georgette Gómez: First LGBTQ Latina Council President
WATCH NOW
Ballots are hitting mailboxes soon. Our heiress opponent has spent millions of family dollars to try and buy her way through the election while hiding where exactly this money is coming from -- by hiding her tax returns, just like President Trump.
This ad gives the voters of CA-53 the opportunity to see their choice in this election: Someone who will work to preserve family wealth and keep money hands in the rich, or someone who dedicates her life to fighting for working families.
We have to keep this ad on the air. And that’s where you come in, friend. Can you watch and then pitch in $5 so we can show the district what Georgette is about?

Friend,
Have you seen where we're at with our biggest fundraising deadline yet?
$50, 000 End of Quarter goal. Amount Left $17,382
It's so important we meet this goal.
We cannot let the self-funding millionaire candidate win, whose grandparents are bankrolling her campaign with a massive super PAC -- it's exactly what we're trying to prove should not be in politics. We are a democracy, and there is nothing democratic about buying elections. Nothing.
Even if Georgette were in the position to self-fund her campaign, the last thing she'd be doing is trying to buy her way up the political totem pole like her opponent, because big money doesn't belong in politics.
Georgette has a firm commitment to advancing our democracy -- and unlike her opponent, we're not pouring family money into buying an election.
Chip in whatever you can to Georgette's campaign -- because at Team Gómez, we’re committed to progressing our democracy.

Friend,
The day is here -- today is Election Day.
All of our hard work is culminating in this moment. San Diegans are casting their ballots as we speak, and voters are making their choice in this important election.
All morning, my team has been out at the polls, speaking with voters and showing our support for everyone taking part in our democratic process!
Georgette out with the team speaking to voters at the polls.
If you haven't voted yet, grab a mask and some hand sanitizer, and make your way to your closest polling place (go to [[URL REDACTED]] to find out where you can vote!).
Once this day comes to a close, we will be waiting for election results. As we are waiting for every ballot to be counted, I'll be thinking about you, friend, and all the people on Team Gómez who have supported our campaign.
It means the world to me to have earned your support, whether that be through a contribution, a volunteer shift, or a vote.
Plus -- today is my birthday! Nothing would mean more to me than seeing you out at the polls, showing your support for this campaign.
As we reach the final hours of voting here in California, I want to ask one more time if you can make a contribution to this campaign. Your support now will make sure every ballot in this district is counted.
Once again, thank you for all the support you have given me. This has been the journey of my lifetime, and I'm glad to have had you alongside me.
With gratitude,
Georgette

Hey team,
Alex here from Team Gómez's finance branch -- and I just wanted to let you know that today marks 50 days until Election Day.
Here's the scoop -- this next fundraising goal is big, and it will help determine what we can do in the crucial last 50 days of the election.
Our opponent is ramping up her campaign spending no problem (helps to have billionaire grandparents). But we've got the will and power of the people \-- and we've gotta keep our message going to bring our bold, progressive policies to Congress.
We need Georgette in Congress to represent working people and families in Congress.
We've got a goal of $7,500 to raise by Wednesday night -- can you rush a donation of $5 or anything you can to help get Georgette to Congress?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate $5
Express Donate $25

Donate Other Amount
This fundraising goal comes at a critical time.
Worst case scenario? We end up having to cut our spending -- in crucial areas like our phone banking, texting, ad budget, our mailing programs, and other programs to make this campaign successful. If we cut down any of these things, we reach fewer voters and could end up with a millionaire representing a working class district -- just another breach of democracy with a candidate that bought her seat.
Best case scenario? We reach our goal -- and maybe, we even outraise our goal. We increase our communication efforts on all fronts and reach twice as many voters than originally anticipated -- and Georgette wins the election in November. Then, we have a representative who pours her heart out for human rights, affordable housing, Medicare for All, and environmental justice.
I think we can all agree -- the best case scenario is what we want to see.
Chip in $5 or whatever makes sense to you right now and don't let another millionaire buy a seat in Congress.

Thanks for your help, team.

Friends --
I’m sure you and I share many of the same concerns right now.
We’re wondering when we will get through this unprecedented time safely, and hoping that we have the capacity and resources to take care of the most vulnerable among us. Many among us are concerned with how to pay the bills if this goes on much longer.
When functioning well, our federal government would have all these answers -- oftentimes before we even posed the questions. But right now, our government is not functioning well.
The truth is, we knew this well before the outbreak.
We knew the the federal government wasn’t functioning well with so many Americans unable to afford suitable housing. We saw flaws in our system when we heard about impoverished children in some parts of our country drinking poisoned drinking water. And we knew the government wasn’t functioning well when millions of citizens live in fear of getting sick because they lack health care.
If this crisis has made anything clear, it’s that a well-functioning government in Washington matters. Now more than ever, we need to fight with more urgency, more conviction, and more energy than ever before to correct course in this country.
I’m running for Congress to be a part of the change that we need to see in Washington. If (and only if) you can, please join the hundreds of individuals who have shown their support to my progressive campaign by making a monthly recurring donation of any amount today.
I'm ready to become a monthly donorI can make a one-time donation

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,Veterans,"#
Friend,
Both Democrats and Republicans talk about how important our veterans are and how critical it is that we support them in this country.
But far too often, it's all talk, no action. When I'm in Congress, I'll make sure we actually provide veterans with the services they need.
On this day six years ago, the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act was signed into law.
This act expanded resources and increased accountability for our veterans. From affordable health care to addressing homeless veterans populations, the act increased funding to help veterans across the country. But still, it's not enough. We need to do more to provide the resources our veterans need to survive and thrive during and after their service for our country.
Serving our country in its toughest moments and risking their lives to protect our freedoms is no easy task, nor is returning to civilian life after service -- just as so many of our friends and family members have done here in San Diego.
While the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act marked some advancements for the veteran community, there is much more work that needs to be done.
In Congress, I am committed to continuing this progress towards providing veterans with the programs and services they need, especially when it comes to their mental health and ensuring housing is provided. If you agree that this needs to be a priority in Congress, add your name to my petition.
SIGN THE PETITION
Our veterans are experiencing mental health issues at an all time high -- with an increased risk of suicide and PTSD, especially compared to the general population. We must address the discrepancies within the lack of mental health care accessibility for our veterans.
Veterans' homelessness continues to rise as well -- in California alone, 2018 homelessness data showed there were around 11,000 veterans reported to be struggling with homelessness. That's 11,000 too many.
I have said it many times before and will say it again -- the federal government needs to do more for our veterans. State and local funds are not enough to give our veterans all of the support they need.
The 53rd Congressional district of California is home to one of the highest concentrations of veterans in the country. As an organizer and as the City Council President, I've dedicated a lot of my work toward addressing homelessness in California -- specifically focusing on our veterans.
When I'm elected to Congress, I will prioritize expanding affordable housing and health care initiatives to address mental health concerns.
Veterans need to be a priority. Sign on to our petition committing to focusing on resources for veterans in Congress.
Thank you for joining me in the fight for our freedom fighters. As they stand up for us, we will ALWAYS stand up for them.
In solidarity,
Georgette

Friend,
The fight for social, racial, and economic justice has never been more urgent.
The time is now.
We're just under 3 months away from Election Day -- and we're seeing a movement of support for progressive candidates like Georgette.
Now is not the time for incremental change -- we need to act NOW to fix our health care, save our planet from climate change, and lift working families up. That takes bold, progressive change -- and that's what Georgette will bring to Washington.
Can you chip in $5 or anything you can to help our efforts in making Georgette our progressive champion?
DONATE
This is a campaign by and for the people. We know what it's like to have to choose between being sick or going to the doctor -- and amidst a deadly pandemic that's plaguing our country, this should not be a decision we are forced to make.
Just as no person should have to choose between medication and food, no person should be kidnapped by a secret police force.
We should be elevating our public schools and empowering our educators -- not cutting corners in their budgets and salaries or forcing them back to work while conditions are still unsafe.
The list goes on and on.
We must elect a progressive champion to stand up for what is right. A progressive who's faced similar hardships and experiences like the exact people she is fighting to represent. Georgette's demonstrated history in public service proves that when you stand up for what you believe is best for the community, change can and will come when we work together for the greater good.
We must come together for the greater good and elect a representative who will do the same. Donate to Georgette's campaign here.

Hi friend,
In a race with two Democrats going head to head, sometimes it can be hard for folks to decide who they plan to vote for.
So, we figured it might be helpful if we broke down the two candidates and what they've been up to.
(In case you don't want to scroll all the way down, the point we are making clear here is that Georgette is the real leader in this race. If you know that, chip in $3 to her campaign today.)
DONATE
First, here's what her opponent, Sara Jacobs, has been up to:
The San Diego Union-Tribune
""Big money flows into San Diego congressional contests despite pandemic""
Times of San Diego
""San Diego Democratic Party Accuses Sara Jacobs of Misleading Voters on Endorsement""
The Hollywood Reporter
""Equality California to Honor Pete and Chasten Buttigieg, 'Disclosure' at Angelica Ross-Hosted Virtual Event""
""Amazon, Facebook, Gilead, Sara Jacobs, Lyft, Molina Healthcare and United Airlines are Presenting Sponsors of the Golden State Equality Awards.""
(That she is listed as a sponsor among multi-billion dollar corporations… is interesting.)
And now, here's what Georgette has been up to:
Times of San Diego
""Nation's Largest Labor Union Endorses Georgette Gómez for Congress""
Kusi News
""San Diego City Council President Georgette Gómez pushes for extended rent payment period""
California Globe
""San Diego City Council Votes to Oppose, Condemn Federal Intervention""
Look, it's abundantly clear that one candidate in this race walks the walk -- while the other dumps millions of her own money to buy this seat. The choice is clear: We HAVE to elect Georgette this November.
We have a mid-month fundraising goal of $5,000 to meet by Monday night. Can you pitch in $3 to make it happen?
DONATE
Thanks for supporting this people-powered campaign. It's so much more than just a money race -- it's about action.

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,A grassroots campaign ,"#
Let's talk about money, friend,
When it comes to campaigning for an election, it's not just about the amount of money that is made, but about where the money comes from.
My opponent funds her campaign with money from her trust fund. The latest FEC report shows that more than 86% of the over $5,000,000 she has spent has come directly from her trust fund. But that's not all -- a super PAC backed by her billionaire grandparents is dedicated exclusively to her and her campaign, all the while our campaign is doing the hard work and raising every single dollar invested.
We're running a 100% people-powered campaign. Will you spare $5 or whatever you can to our campaign today?

Our campaign has been funded by grassroots supporters like you, and I'm very proud to be a candidate that relies on our community to be able to communicate.
At the end of the day, the amount of money we raise from now to November 3rd is crucial -- which is why I am reaching out to ask for your support right now.
This campaign is not, and should not be, about the person with the most money getting elected. This should be about what values people want in their next representative. This campaign is about progressive policies, working tirelessly to make health care for all a human right, lowering the cost of education, and forming a government that is fair for everyone, no matter your zip code, your income level, who you love, or what you look like.
So much is on the line this election. We just can't let this campaign be another one won by the person with the most personal wealth.
I'm not running for Congress in CA-53 to advance my political career, I'm running to advance our community and our values. I'll be a leading voice in the fight to take money out of politics, because in a democratic society, voters choose the leaders -- not wallets.
So, what do you say? Can you spare $5 or anything else so I can fight to take big money out of where it doesn't belong?
DONATE
Thanks for your support -- let's continue fighting for a just future.

Friend --
Did you hear the news? Senator Elizabeth Warren has just endorsed Georgette Gómez for Congress!
Now more than ever, we need experienced and ethical leaders who will help struggling families and rebuild America with bold new investments in people, public health and jobs. Senator Warren knows that Georgette has the courage and conviction to fight for big, structural change in Congress.
This is a game-changer, friend! And right now we need to build on this momentum:
Will you chip in a contribution of $3 to help us celebrate this HUGE endorsement? Just like Senator Warren, Georgette won’t take a dime from corporate PACs and we’re depending on grassroots support to bring progressive change to CA-53.
Donate $3This endorsement is another reminder that Georgette is building a broad and truly historic coalition in this race. Labor unions, environmental groups, the California Democratic Party, local elected leaders, and leading Democrats like Senator Warren are all unifying behind our campaign.
We’re humbled by the support, but we’re still up against our self-funding opponent’s millions as well as her personal super PAC.
Because of her massive spending, our opponent was the top vote winner in the March primary election. Overcoming that in November is going to require overwhelming grassroots energy.
We need you, friend: Join Georgette and Senator Warren in our fight for real progressive change in San Diego. Chip in $3 to help us win in CA-53.

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,An update on San Diego’s COVID-19 response:,"#
Friend --
I wanted to take a moment and share the latest updates regarding our city’s response to COVID-19.
But I want to start off by saying thank you.
From the beginning, the city council and our mayor came to the shared conclusion that if our response was going to succeed, we’d all have to work together. That includes with other cities in our region, county officials, the state, and of course, residents like you.
We’ve followed every recommendation and implemented some unique changes of our own to keep each other safe and do our part to flatten the curve. And with your support it’s working.
As the weather heats up, it's only natural that we want to head for the San Diego beaches, parks, and trails that we all know and love.
The good news is that we were able to do a soft opening of some city parks to provide an outlet for people to be physically and mentally active. But it’s critical that we maintain our social distance — even at parks. We’re hopeful that residents will continue to take the measures seriously so this soft opening can continue.
Here’s some of what I’m keeping an eye on this week:
\- Limited Reopening of Beaches: Today, San Diego's beaches are open to surfers, swimmers, and runners on the sand. Please note that group gatherings and lying down on the beach are not allowed.
\- CARES Act Funding: Last week, I sent a letter to Mayor Faulconer urging him to maximize the $248 million in federal CARES Act funding that we’ve been allocated. As City Council President, it’s my goal to make sure our most vulnerable are not left behind.
\- Otay Mesa Detention Center: I’ve called on Gavin Newsom to join me in calling for a drastic reduction in the number of people held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center where a COVID-19 outbreak has infected detainees and staff. Detaining people in these unsafe circumstances is cruel and must end.  You can add your name to the petition to join this effort here >>
I’ll continue to keep you up to date. In the meantime, stay safe — and as much as you can, stay inside.
Georgette Gómez
We understand this is a difficult time, so please take care of yourself and your loved ones. We have a crucial end-of-month fundraising deadline coming up, and need some support. But please only chip in to my congressional campaign if you can afford to do so right now.

"Alex, TeamGómez",teamgg@georgettegomez.org,Playing it safe ,"#
Friend,
It's no secret that Georgette's self-funded billionaire opponent has a lot more money to spend than our campaign. She has several offices, TV ads on the air, a fancy website -- all the fixings of a well-funded campaign.
But nothing can compare to a people-powered campaign.
Across the country, progressive candidates like Georgette are overwhelmingly winning their elections. Voters are tired of business as usual and are ready to see real change. Tired of electing the “safe” candidate who simply isn't willing to go the extra mile for the working people.
The time has come -- we're done “playing it safe.”
There's too much at stake this election. We're more than halfway to our mid-month fundraising goal of $5,000 -- can you chip in $5 to help make Georgette our progressive champion?

The progressive movement has made some major strides -- between the primary wins of Ritchie Torres, Cori Bush, Rashida Tlaib, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, progressive candidates who live and breathe their communities are winning -- and Georgette is one of them.
With the progressive movement growing throughout all parts of the country, Georgette has the momentum to win this.
It's long overdue that we shift the Democratic party away from corporations and big businesses -- it's time for Democrats to move towards protecting the working class. From initiatives like Medicare-For-All, the Green New Deal, police reform, and investment in our communities, progressives have the bold ideas and solutions to bring our country forward and make it a better place to live for everyone.
We can't afford to play it safe. You, your family, your neighbor, or your coworker's life may truly depend on it.
It's time for us to root for the fighter we truly deserve -- and that fighter is Georgette. Chip in to Georgette's campaign before midnight tonight so we meet our mid-month fundraising goal and have what it takes.

We've got 77 days left to make our mark before the election -- and that's exactly what we're going to do, together.

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,"Much has changed, but the reasons I am running have not.","#
Friend --
When we launched this campaign, I never would have imagined that we'd be campaigning during a global pandemic.
I haven't seen my campaign staff in-person in weeks. I have to admit, the disconnect of conference calls and video chats is beginning to wear on me. We've also had to cancel all of our in-person events like group phone banks.
As a grassroots campaign, we're still processing how our volunteer efforts will look in the next couple of months.
Much has changed, but the reasons I am running have not.
San Diego is my home. I grew up in Barrio Logan, and my life's work has been centered around addressing injustices and improving the quality of life for our communities. It's what I've been devoted to since day one on the City Council.
This campaign is about truly addressing the issues we face -- whether we’re talking about this pandemic, expanding affordable housing, ending poverty, achieving environmental justice, or fixing health care access for all.
I'm up against a big end-of-month fundraising deadline in 24 hours, and right now we’re falling short. Can I count on you to contribute $3 to help us pick up the pace? I wouldn’t reach out like this if it wasn't important.
I'll be blunt: my least favorite part of campaigning for Congress has been the fundraising. And I don't believe for a second that money is the most important factor in winning this race.
But when you make a donation, you're doing more than just funding our efforts. You're sending a message that this San Diego community is resilient and is ready for some home-grown, progressive change in Washington.
That, to me, is much more powerful, and it's why I value your support so much -- especially right now.
Before this deadline hits, please add a donation of $3 to help us hit our goal. We can get there if all work together to do it.
Thank you — from the bottom of my heart.

Friend,
We're not a campaign that celebrates the NRA ever. Georgette supports gun control and wants to see the power of the gun lobby diminished with campaign finance reform.
We never thought we'd be proud of something the NRA handed to us -- but we do agree with their report card for Georgette: The NRA gave her an F rating. It’s a badge of honor.
According to them, Georgette is a ""True enemy of gun owners' rights. A consistent anti-gun candidate who always opposes gun owners' rights and/or actively leads anti-gun legislative efforts, or sponsors anti-gun legislation."" You're damn right she is.
If you support gun control and commonsense legislation to keep firearms out of dangerous hands, chip in to Georgette's campaign for Congress today.
The NRA has consistently bankrolled efforts to block commonsense gun laws that would save lives in our country. I want nothing to do with them. Proud of my F rating. This one is going on my fridge.

GeorgetteGomez.org,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,Breaking: Voter Manipulation in San Diego,"#
Friends --
We have some breaking news: Our opponent, Sara Jacobs -- heiress to the Jacobs family billions -- just dropped a new, expensive ad campaign designed to manipulate San Diego voters into voting for a REPUBLICAN.
Using hundreds of thousands of dollars in profits from Wall Street and drug companies, Sara Jacobs is now running TV ads to promote a Republican candidate in the race for CA-53. It’s an attempt to BLOCK Georgette Gómez from reaching the run-off.
Will you chip in $3 to help us counter Sara Jacobs cynical ploy to manipulate voters by boosting a Republican candidate?
Promoting a Republican that otherwise would have never gotten their message on the airwaves highlights that Jacobs is worried about her chances against a true progressive leader like Georgette.
It also shows that Jacobs will do anything to win this race.
» She lied about her experience working in the Obama Administration.
» She misled voters into thinking she had the Democratic Party endorsement (Georgette is the only candidate officially supported by the Democratic Party)
» Now, she’s dropping massive sums in order to manipulate the vote outcome.
Will you help keep this election honest by making an urgent $3 donation to Georgette right away? We now run the risk of being blocked from the General Election.
Thank you so much for any help you can provide,

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,Quite the journey,"#
Friend,
We are in the home stretch. The election is just over a week away -- and what a journey this has been.
When I announced I was running for Congress to become the first LGBTQ+ Latina in this 231 year old institution, our country and economy were fully open, we had nine Supreme Court justices, and we were not in the midst of a horrific pandemic. A LOT has changed since then.
This year has been difficult. We've lost over 220,000 of our loved ones to the COVID-19 pandemic. Civil rights hero John Lewis passed away in July, and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away just over a month ago.
We have record unemployment. Our students and teachers are adapting to learning remotely or teaching with masks on. Families are struggling more than ever to make ends meet, and our Congress has not passed a relief bill to get us through this crisis for months.
While this situation seems dire, we have drawn so much from our collective strength. In the face of pain and struggle, we have shown our resilience. It is this strength and resilience that motivates me every day to be the next representative for CA-53. Without you, team, this would have been so much harder.
Now, more than ever before, we see the need for bold, progressive policies to bring our country forward.
With just 5 days left in the month, our team has set an ambitious goal of $75,000 to raise by Oct. 31st to make sure this campaign of love, strength, and bold progressivism wins. Chip in $5 or anything you can today.

Hey, there. It’s Alex, Georgette's Deputy Campaign Manager.
I’m reaching out with a quick update on our end-of-quarter fundraising push. Our FEC deadline hits in 5 days, and we still have some work to do if we're going to submit our strongest fundraising report possible.
But there is some good news. I’ve been crunching the numbers, and it looks like we have an opportunity to reach our goal of raising $35,000 from online donors to send progressive Democrat Georgette Gomez to Congress.
Hitting this mark would send a HUGE message about the strength of our grassroots campaign. That's especially important because our opponent is a self-funder with the vast majority of her funds – 82% per the latest FEC reports – coming in from her own personal bank account.
With that in mind, will you add a $3 donation before our FEC deadline? Remember, it's not about how much you give, it's about sending a message about the breadth of support in our first reporting deadline of the General Election.

It’s been an incredible week for progressive candidates like Georgette.
Democrats like Georgette who have been endorsed by Senator’s Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and groups like Justice Democrats made waves in competitive primaries.
We have an opportunity to keep the momentum going, but it’s going to take a groundswell of grassroots support to make it happen.
Thanks in advance for chipping in.

Team,
This whole campaign has led us to this moment. What happens in these next seven days will affect our country and our community for years to come.
I just took a look at what we have left to spend this cycle -- and we need to step it up.
To get our ads on the air as much as possible over these final days, we need to meet our end-of-month goal of $75,000. Otherwise, we'll have to cut corners somewhere.
Can you chip in $5 or whatever you can to make sure we're prepared for anything in the final week of the campaign?
DONATE
We're up against a wealthy opponent with billionaire family members who are funding super PACs and attack ads against us. We have the momentum we need to win, but we need resources.
This week, we plan on getting a final batch of ads up, doing the last round of voter outreach, and continuing to help district residents make their voting plans.
I don't want to have to scale back these programs. We have the passion, the talent, and the team to make them work -- but we're up against very real financial constraints.
Team: This campaign is 100% people-powered, and it's going to take everything we have to beat our opponent. Can you step up and donate today to help reach our $75,000 end-of-month fundraising goal?

Hello friend.
I’m Alex, and I’m excited to introduce myself as Georgette's new Deputy Campaign Manager.
I’ve been working with Georgette closely over the last couple of weeks, and it's been remarkable to see her passion for service up close.
She's laser focused on guiding San Diego through the COVID-19 crisis. But she also has some bold ideas for how we can use this opportunity to reinvest in our future like never before. It’s a difficult time, but I'm excited to be on this team.
I’m reaching out today to make sure you saw the news that we formed a National Finance Committee to help our campaign raise the resources we need to win.
Some of our leading co-chairs include State Senate President Toni Atkins, former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, and former State Senator Chris Kehoe.
Running against an ultra-wealthy self-funder is no easy task, and the success of this committee is going to depend on your continued support too, friend.
So to kick things off on strong footing we set a goal of raising $15,000 before the end of the week:
Can I count on you to add a donation to our campaign today? It’s not about how much you give -- it's about chipping in to say that you're with us in this fight.
Thanks so much,

“Georgette Gómez Releases Taxes, Urges Congress Rival Jacobs to Do Same”

It's been nearly 1 week since Georgette released her tax return, but we're still waiting for her opponent -- who is trying to buy a seat in Congress -- to do the same.
Chip in here to Georgette's campaign -- because she's the candidate that's got nothing to hide. Make sure we hit our last end-of-quarter goal.

Friend,
Have you heard the news?
Last week, Georgette released her tax returns, showing the district that she has nothing to hide. She urged her opponent to do the same. Unsurprisingly, we're still waiting.
We all know how the richest people in this country operate. Just ask the President of the United States why he refuses to release his taxes -- we're sure the reasons are similar to our heiress opponent's.
Our opponent just released her plan for a “non-corrupt” government -- but guess what isn't mentioned? Tax information being made public.
Thankfully, we don't need to settle for a representative like that.
Georgette has been a constant advocate for transparency in government and politics -- urging congressional candidates to do the same is just a small portion of her dedication in exposing corruption and demanding our elected officials to do right by the people.
We need her in Congress -- because she's a voice of the people and not anyone else.
Donate $5 or whatever you can to Georgette's campaign today -- it's the biggest fundraising deadline of election season, and we’ve got to show up for her like she’s shown up for us.
DONATE
Thanks for your support. Together, we'll elect Georgette and get the government transparency that's long overdue.

We've got to be honest -- our tails have never wagged faster when it comes to our Mom and her campaign. 12/10, would elect.
Georgette's dogs, Canela and Totoro
We see her less, but we love her even more -- she puts everyone before herself and is always working her hardest to make a difference in EVERYONE'S lives!
She sacrifices so much for other people -- she taught us that no matter how many bones we have, we should always share. That's exactly what she does, and more.
We wanted to help so bad, and that's why we're WOOFING at you to see if you could BARK up $5 to give to our Mom's campaign today?

The other day, we overheard Mom talking about her millionaire opponent -- and WHAT THE WOOF?
When she mentioned that her opponent was spending millions on ad buys and her self-funded campaign, our tails came to a full stop. That NEVER happens. Totoro even started to growl -- and he’s the nice one!
We know we can't do much for our Mom's campaign, and that's why we stole her computer to send you this email.
Can you woof up a little change to help out our Mom in her campaign?

Mom's gonna find out we hacked into her email sooner or later, so we'll bark at you all later!
Remember to spread the word and howl as loud as you can to elect our Mom, Georgette Gómez, for CA-53! If any of our fellow dogs and humans are supporting Georgette, share a photo on social media with the hashtag #WOOFS4GEORGETTE so we can bark from afar!

Friend,
In the age of coronavirus, more CA-53 voters will be casting their ballots by mail than ever before.
With budget cuts to the USPS and constant partisan attacks on this critically important government service, folks are being encouraged to cast their ballots early.
This all means we have a limited time to remind voters why Georgette Gómez is the candidate and progressive fighter we need in Congress.
So, can you pitch in $5 or whatever makes sense to you so we can ramp up this campaign's operations to 150% for the next month?
DONATE
In the next few weeks, we'll be getting our ads in front of voters, yard signs on front lawns, and mailers sent to mailboxes across the district.
We're going against an opponent with unlimited resources -- a luxury we don't have. But we have a secret weapon: We have grassroots supporters like you, team.
Together, we know we can win this -- but we're going to need you to step up in these critical moments. Can you chip in now to help us finish this campaign stronger than ever?

Good morning, friend.
It's Election Day. Before I hit the doors, I wanted to take a moment and give you one last update from the campaign trail.
But first, I’d like to start by saying thank you.
It means the world to me to have your confidence, and I’m proud to say that this campaign has been a community-led effort from the very start. Thanks to you, we are heading into the day with momentum, and our campaign to enact meaningful, progressive change for our communities and our working families is stronger than ever.
I’m also so proud that we’ve been able to build an incredibly broad coalition behind our campaign. Our endorsements include:
\- The California Democratic Party (We’re the only official nominee)
\- The California Federation of Teachers
\- The California Labor Federation
\- The California Nurses Association
We’ve picked up support from national progressive figures:
\- Senator Bernie Sanders
\- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
\- Rep. Pramilla Jayyapal
\- Rep. Ro Khanna
We also have support from local elected leaders:
\- State Senator Toni Atkins
\- Assemblymember Shirley Weber
\- Assemblymember Todd Gloria
\- Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez
\- County Supervisor Nathan Fletcher
\- National City Mayor Alejandra Sotelo-Solis
\- Councilmember Barbara Bry
\- Councilmember Monica Montgomery… and many more
To view our full list of endorsers, click here >>
We’re two days from Election Day, and there are still ways you can help our campaign:
1\. Volunteer and help us turn out voters. We are calling voters and knocking doors around the clock until polls close. This is probably the most impactful action you can take to make sure we emerge victorious. Join us here.
2\. Vote! Make sure that you, and everybody you know, submits their ballots as soon as possible or gets to the polls before they close tonight at 8:00pm (Tuesday March 3rd). For information on voting, click here.
3\. Spread the word. Forward this email to five or more friends and family that live in the area. Explain why you are supporting my campaign, and direct them to my website for more information about my policies and experience.
4\. Share your story. Spread the word about our campaign on Facebook and Twitter, and be sure to tell your story about why you are supporting our campaign.
I’m ready to deliver for this community -- on universal health care, ending the climate crisis, housing, comprehensive immigration reform, and so much more. But I cannot do this alone. Taking our locally-grown, progressive vision to Washington is going to require this whole community coming together.
Thank you for your vote today, and for helping us make history in our San Diego community.

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,"Today, we celebrate ALL students ","#
Friend,
Growing up, my primary means of transportation was a public bus. Like many others, I traveled to a district with greater funding and resources to help aid my academic and career trajectory. From an early age, I saw the economic, racial and social disparities between communities. The school in my home district did not have the funding for equitable resources to equitably support students.
This opportunity helped pave the path for my college degree. My parents and I worked multiple jobs to get me through college, and I graduated as a first-generation student at San Diego State University.
I became a community organizer. Then, I eventually became City Council President. Now, I'm running for Congress.
But my experience should not be the norm. In the richest country on earth, there is no excuse. Our schools are underfunded, our teachers are underpaid, and so many of our students don't easily have access to resources needed to achieve their best self. Communities bear the brunt of these inequities.
It's why I am running for Congress. But I can't get there without your help, especially because I am going toe-to-toe with a wealthy self-funder. Can you chip in $5 right now?
On this day 46 years ago, the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 became federally recognized in the United States, prohibiting discrimination of students, faculty, and staff on all fronts. It was a step forward in making schools more equitable for every student. However, we have so much more to do!
On this year's EEOA anniversary, we celebrate all students, and we promise to create equitable opportunities for all.
In Congress, I will continue to be a champion for schools and for our students -- so that every child, no matter where they live, has the opportunity to succeed and thrive. If that's a mission you can get behind, chip in $5 to my campaign today.
Everyone's voice is valued and deserves to be uplifted and that must start early. The educational environment and resources given to children have impacted their childhood and economic mobility. We must ensure all students have equitable resources, no matter what their socioeconomic status is and no matter whether kids are learning in classrooms or online.
These beliefs I hold make the endorsements of this campaign by the California Federation of Teachers and National Education Association more meaningful. Having the backing of the biggest teachers' unions means they believe in what we stand for: Better pay and facilities for our educators and better education for our children. The support of Congress to let the teachers get their jobs done.
If you want to see our students succeed, help elect a leader who navigated a system stacked against kids like me to see success. Chip in $5 to this campaign today.
In solidarity,
Georgette Gómez

Team,
We wanted to give a quick breakdown of what our opponent has been up to in the final days of this race.
First: Our opponent's FEC report showed that over 86% of the whopping $5,000,000 she has spent in this race came directly from her family fortunes.
Then: She released multiple ads attacking Georgette in malicious, untruthful ways. Plus, the super PAC funded by her grandparents did the same just days later. They're coming at Georgette from all sides with huge sums of money.
Now: With just 4 days left, we've got to keep our ads up and running. We need to reach as many voters as possible before Tuesday, and we need to share the truth about Georgette and the type of congresswoman she will be for our district.
The time has NEVER been more urgent -- will you donate $5 or whatever you can to help fund Georgette's campaign in these final days?

Georgette doesn’t have the same inherited wealth that our opponent is relying on to fund her campaign. Even though we can’t match our opponent's spending, with your help, we can raise enough money to deliver our campaign's message to voters and win.
We have the support of our grassroots donors like you -- which is just how politics should be, a grassroots campaign supported by the people.
In our final days, Georgette is going to need as many donations as possible. This is our last chance to reach voters so we can get Georgette, the people’s candidate, to Congress. Your donations, no matter how big or small, are what keeps this campaign going -- and at this point in the campaign, they help keep our ads running. Our ads tell the actual truth of our campaign's message and combat the lies our opponent is spreading in her ads.
We can win this race, but we need the resources to do that -- rush a donation today and help us out in this final stretch to Election Day.

Hi friend,
Georgette here -- and I'm writing to let you know that we're facing our final -- our biggest, our most important fundraising deadline of the entire election cycle.
People are always going to talk -- especially when an unconventional candidate like myself is running head-to-head with a self-funder. So, let's give them something to talk about.
They'll especially be talking when they hear our final end of month fundraising goal -- $75,000. We'll hear it all \-- “You can't raise that kind of money without PACs and big money donors...” or “The first LGBTQ+ Latina in Congress? She'll never win against a millionaire.”
Let's show them that there's no power like the people -- and our power as the people can't be stopped.
Chip in to this historic, grassroots campaign to help us meet our $75,000 goal by this weekend's deadline.

But here I am, thanks to you.
Every retweet and Facebook share, every virtual town hall, every lawn sign, and every donation, no matter how big or small, has shown me that we can make history. We will make history. I could be the first LGBTQ+ Latina in Congress -- thanks to you.

Friend --
I am writing today to share the news that I have just endorsed Georgette Gómez for Congress in California’s 53rd Congressional District. I hope you will join me in supporting Georgette with a donation, but first let me explain why:
The truth is, this is the most important election in our lifetime, and we need representatives like Georgette who understand that real change comes from the bottom up — not the top down.
Georgette was born and raised in Barrio Logan to immigrant parents who worked multiple jobs and barely made ends meet. But that did not stop her from pursuing a career of activism to achieve environmental and health justice for her community.
Her commitment to justice led her to run for the city council where she became the first LGBTQ and Latina City Council President in San Diego’s history.
Look, when Georgette says she committed to standing up to Donald Trump on issues like climate change, affordable housing, and poverty -- it’s not just a talking point. She has lived these struggles. And I know she will fight a system that is rigged against the working class.
If you’re with me, let me know right now. Make a contribution of $27 to Georgette’s campaign. She won’t take a dime from corporate PACs so please know that your donation will make a huge difference to her campaign. If you've save your information with ActBlue Express, your contribution will be processed immediately.

And as long as we continue standing together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish.

Hey team,
There are just 21 days left until the election!
That means 21 days to spread Georgette's message, get our ads on the air as much as we can, and reach every single voter possible.
We've built an amazing team since the start of this campaign, and I'm confident we have what it takes to win. But I won't lie to you, friend -- it's hard work, and it takes a lot of resources. We don't want to run out of funds too early, which is why I'm asking for your help right now.
Can you donate $21 or whatever you can to make sure we finish strong? We have a midmonth fundraising goal of $20,000 to hit by Friday night -- so we need you to step up now.

This is the home stretch. The entire campaign has led up to this moment -- the next few weeks are a mad dash to Election Day (for us and for our opponent).
If you have the means, would you consider making your $21 donation weekly? There are just 3 weeks left of the campaign.

Friend, yesterday Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away.
Our country lost a hero, a fearless advocate for justice and righteousness, and a trailblazing woman who suffered no fools.
The notorious RBG spoke out about the injustices in our society, and every day, she worked hard to make this country a better place for everyone.
But the truth is, Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump are going to give everything they've got to dismantle the work she did and to erase her legacy. They will violate their own standards to push through a Supreme Court justice who will be anti-choice, anti-Affordable Care Act, and anti-who knows what else. We can't let that happen.
In Congress, I'll work tirelessly to protect RBG's legacy and keep on pushing for justice and inclusion.

We hope you are not among those who have suddenly found themselves facing unexpected difficult times. If you are... this email is not for you.
This email is only for those fortunate enough to have a steady income during these tough times. These are not easy words to write at this moment, but the truth is we need your support -- now more than ever.
As you can imagine, we have radically shifted how we are operating our campaign for Congress. Most notably, we have cancelled in-person fundraisers. That has required us to rethink how to raise the funds we need to continue to fight for the progressive, humanitarian values we believe in.
So much has changed, but the amount required to make a successful bid for Congress has not. And right now, running a competitive, well-funded campaign means raising another $45,000 before our end-of-quarter deadline hits on Tuesday.
So we have to ask:
If you are able, can you please contribute $3 or more to Georgette’s campaign today? Not only will you help us meet our FEC fundraising goal, you’ll help us send a powerful message that we’re still as committed as ever to our shared progressive values.

GeorgetteGómez.org,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,A huge victory for LGBTQ rights. ,"#
GREAT news to kick off the week, friend.
The Supreme Court just ruled that under federal law, employers can no longer fire or discriminate against workers for being LGBTQ.
It’s hard to understate how big this is in the fight for equality. Yesterday, it was legal to fire employees for being LGBTQ in 27 states. Under today’s landmark ruling -- it’s now illegal in all 50.
This is an historic win, but there’s still a lot of work to do:
Last week, the Trump Administration revoked nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people in health care and health insurance. This ruling doesn't change that. But, the Equality Act -- which is still sitting on Mitch McConnell’s desk -- would put an end to all LGBTQ discrimination.
We need to continue our work, and one big way to do that is by electing the most LGTBQ Congress in history. And that starts in CA-53 by electing Georgette Gómez.
Tonight is our mid-month deadline and we’re falling short of our goal. Can we count on you to contribute $3 to elect Georgette so we can make history for LGTBQ equality?
Thanks for your support!

Breaking News: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Courage to Change PAC has just endorsed Georgette Gómez for Congress!
AOC and Courage to Change are working to elect a new generation of progressive leaders — community leaders, activists, and working-class candidates.

Friends -- here’s a quick Sunday update from Team Gómez HQ:
Tuesday night is our end-of-quarter fundraising deadline. As a quick reminder, this deadline is especially important because it’s the first one in our General Election matchup against our self-funding opponent.
We’re hoping to send a message of grassroots strength but we need to raise another $2,351 before midnight tonight to stay on track. Can you send a donation to Georgette’s campaign today?
FEC DEADLINE: Donate Today! Donate $3
We’re gearing up for what promises to be one of the most expensive races in the country:
- On one side, you’ve got Sara Jacobs who has self-funded two congressional runs in different districts to the tune of millions. She lost the primary in CA-49 in 2018. Now she’s spending big money to try and buy this district.
\- And one the other hand, you’ve got City Council President Georgette Gómez -- a community organizer who worked to improve this district her entire life. In her first City Council race she was outspent 3-to-1, but the power of the people won. Now, she’s fighting to be our next congressional member.
Cash is not everything, but you pitching in demonstrates that this seat will not be bought. Chip in now to help us build a strong, people-powered movement >>

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,"We ended carotid restraint in San Diego. Now, let’s end it nationally.","#
Friend --
Earlier today we saw a President continue to incite, demonize and divide. In San Diego, we’re going in the other direction – united, focused on fighting for justice and determined to keep the peace.
I’m proud to announce that San Diego is one of the first cities in America to take direct action to ensure that the tactics that led to George Floyd’s tragic death are never used here.
Today, the San Diego Police Department is ending use of the carotid restraint – a chokehold technique many of us have worked for years to ban.
This is an important step forward for police reform, building trust between communities and law enforcement and it’s long past time.
We’re putting the passions of the protests towards real progress for racial justice, fair policing and upholding the dignity of every San Diegan.
We need to take the next step. Please sign my petition calling on Congress to implement a nationwide ban on carotid restraint.
Chokeholds incite at a time when we need to de-escalate. A knee on the neck ended the life out of George Floyd. And in San Diego, we are determined to ensure that never happens here.
To the peaceful protesters: I know you’re angry – and I’m angry too. I want you to know that we hear your voices and we are taking action. And there’s more reform to come.
And to the San Diego Police: We need you to de escalate, not escalate, in these highly charged moments. And I want to thank our Chief of Police David Nisleit for helping implement this important reform.
San Diego – please stay safe tonight. Please stay united tonight. And please know that our work for justice, dignity and respect for all continues.
From the bottom of my heart,
Georgette Gómez

Hey team,
As a member of Team Gómez, we want you to be one of the first to know the exciting news: We have our very first ad of the general election coming out in just a few days!
With in-person events canceled and our field program moved to all-digital, we have to come up with safe ways to let CA-53 voters know who the best candidate for our district is.
Our new ad will do just that -- it will inform voters about the work Georgette has already done for our community here in San Diego and how she's going to keep up that work in Washington.
I got an early look at the ad, and it’s going to blow people away. But to get an ad on the air is expensive -- and we don’t have wealthy relatives to fund our campaign.
We need our strongest grassroots supporters to step up now to help us raise $10,000 by Monday night so we can get this critical ad in front of as many voters as possible. Can you chip in $5 or anything you can right now?

We know how important it is to elect the right leaders to represent our district in Congress.
Georgette has been working for years advocating for our communities, and that work will only intensify when she’s in Washington.
She has the guts, the work ethic, and the experience to get to work to make health care more affordable and accessible, to mitigate the climate crisis, and to help our country get back on its feet after the coronavirus pandemic.
Georgette is exactly the type of progressive representative we need and deserve -- and that’s why we need voters here in San Diego to see our latest campaign ad!
Pitch in $5 or whatever you can by Monday night so we can get our latest ad on the air >>
Thanks for stepping up, friend -- we know we can always count on you.

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,Money doesn't vote -- people do,"#
Hi friend,
When I first ran for San Diego City Council, I was outraised 3:1 -- but still, we won.
This spring, we came second in a crowded primary, coming up against opponents who spent heaping gobs of money to beat us.
And now, we're running against a self-funded candidate who has run for Congress twice in two different districts out of convenience.
My entire public service career is dedicated to the 53rd district of California -- and let me assure you, I'm not running here because it's convenient. I'm running here because this is the community that shaped me into the leader I am today -- I grew up here, I live and breathe this community. This is our home. These are our neighbors, our businesses, and our schools.
I know that we can bring about the change we need in the 53rd district, and that's why I'm fighting so hard to earn your support to get to Congress.
We're coming up just a little short of the end-of-month fundraising goal we set to be on track with all of our campaign's plans for August and beyond. Can you chip in $5 before midnight tonight?
At Team Gómez, we stand with the essential workers in our district and beyond, and they stand with us.
At Team Gómez, we empower teachers, students, and faculty -- and as we have their back, they've got ours.
And at Team Gómez, we know we have to earn your vote \-- unlike our opponent, who has literally spent millions of self-funded dollars to buy a seat in Congress.
As we continue to build a diverse coalition across our district, we are only set up to thrive. We are a grassroots, people-powered campaign through and through.
We may be underdogs because we don't have unlimited financial resources like our opponent -- but that only puts more fire behind us and will make this win even sweeter.
We're so close to raising the $15,000 that we need by midnight tonight, but we're short $3,376. Can you pitch in right now to make this election possible?

Our country is being challenged in 2020 -- by a climate change-induced global pandemic, a shattering recession, and a reckoning on race and justice.
We've learned once again that elections have consequences -- and having elected leaders with proven records of leadership and getting things done can make the difference between life and death. We need policies and big ideas, not just platitudes.
We need to strengthen America with bold new investments in people.
That's why I'm excited to publish my  Bold Agenda To Invest In America for when I am elected to Congress. Read our policy plans here, and share on social media to amplify this progressive campaign's mission.

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,Sign on: We need universal vote-by-mail ,"#
Hello friend,
I'm reaching out about an important problem we are now grappling with as a result of this pandemic -- ensuring that every American can still have their voice heard in our elections, and that they can do so safely.
We need to be clear from the outset: The Republicans' efforts to force in-person voting in Wisconsin yesterday was totally reprehensible. This is much bigger than politics, and we cannot force the American people to choose between their health and participating in our democracy.
I totally support the efforts of Governor Gavin Newsom to expand vote-by-mail in our state. I'm also proud that Democrats and Republicans in San Diego have led the way to grow vote-by-mail participation in the community. But there's much more we can do and must do as a country:
Can you add your name and say that you support nationwide, universal vote-by-mail in our coming elections? Every American should be given the opportunity to vote remotely during this pandemic. Add your nameAs you may know, a handful of states like Oregon and Washington already hold elections entirely with mail-in ballots. Unfortunately, mail-in ballot laws are not as friendly in other parts of the United States. It’s going to require an overwhelming, nationwide push to move this forward, and I need your help to get the ball rolling.
Add your name to say that you support universal vote-by-mail in our coming elections >>
Thanks for all you do,
Georgette

Friend --
Grassroots. It’s a word that gets thrown around a lot in politics, but what does a true grassroots candidate for Congress actually look like?
One thing it means for Team Georgette is that we’re people-powered, and won't take any contributions from corporate PACs. Georgette strongly believes that if we're going to level the playing field for working families, then we can't rely on money with corporate strings attached.
But that means we don't have much of a cushion to fall back on when times are unexpectedly tough like they are right now. As you know, we've had to pause all of Georgette’s in person events -- including our fundraisers.
No matter how you cut it, online contributions -- on emails just like this one -- are going to play an enormous role in our efforts to win this seat.  So today, we're humbly asking if you can make a grassroots contribution of $3 to help us elect a grassroots progressive in CA-53.
DONATE $3A fundraising dip can be especially detrimental in our race.
In our primary election, we were outspent by a 3:1 margin by our self-funding opponent and a super PAC that formed to support her. We're expecting more of the same in the General Election.
The truth is, money isn’t everything -- but it does matter. And every dollar we raise increases our ability to share Georgette's positive message. We really don't want to rollback our paid outreach efforts due to a cash shortage. So we’ve got to ask:
If you’re financially able, please help Georgette close the spending gap to get her progressive message out. Anything you can contribute today will go a long way.
DONATE $3Thanks for your support, and stay safe.

Team,
Let's keep the momentum going.
We've been working tirelessly to spread Georgette's message by speaking with voters over the phone, sending mailers out, and hosting interactive Zoom events.
We're proud of our progress.
But in order to run a full operation for the next month, we must do more. It is imperative that we get in touch with as many people as possible before they cast their ballots.
And that's not easy -- especially when our millionaire opponent is self-funding her campaign and has a super PAC supporting her, courtesy of her billionaire grandparents.
Georgette's campaign relies on grassroots contributions from everyday people like you. We're still $7,493 away from reaching our Thursday night fundraising goal. Will you donate $5 or whatever you can to help us pay for crucial voter outreach resources?
Chip in for:
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
$5: Voter contact software
$15: Video conference subscription
$25: Phone plan
$75: High speed internet
Other amount
The stakes have never been higher, and we need to ramp up our campaign efforts if we want to win this thing in November.
Since we can't do our normal door-to-door canvassing, we are getting creative with how we reach out to voters.
We're proud of the way we've adapted, but we can't rest on our accomplishments -- we need to expand our voter outreach efforts now that ballots are coming in the mail.
Pitch in $5 or anything you can so we can reach as many CA-53 voters as possible before all ballots are cast.
Thanks for your continued support. We couldn't do it without you.

Friend --
Here’s the good news: Our momentum is growing. We’re communicating Georgette’s message across the district, and we have more authentic grassroots enthusiasm than any other campaign in this race. The best part is, it’s all happening right as voters are beginning to make their decision about who to vote for.
But there is some bad news: Remember that super PAC the spent over $670,000 to support our opponent? Well, we just got word they're dropping another $250,000 against us for good measure. That's in addition to the $1.2 million that our opponent already spent on TV ads. Their ads are on TV as often as Mike Bloomberg's!
We are being outspent, and this race has gotten more expensive than we ever imagined. The truth is, we’re NOT going to compete in the money chase with our billionaire, self-funding opponent. But we need to meet our own goals. So we're asking:
Can you make a contribution to our campaign today? Help us close the week with $50,000 for voter outreach, mailers, and digital ads to get Georgette across the finish line.

Hi friend,
I wanted to talk to you about my good friend, Georgette Gómez, and why it's so important that she makes it to Congress this November.
Not only will Georgette be an advocate for the bold, progressive policies we need to move our country forward, but she'll be making history while doing so!
Georgette would be the first LGBTQ Latina elected to Congress -- and that kind of representation matters. When I won in 2012, representing the Inland Empire, I was the first openly gay person of color elected to Congress. I'm so excited that 8 years later, we can continue to make history with your help.
Join me in supporting Georgette for Congress today -- chip in $5 or anything you can to her campaign.
DONATE
Not only will Georgette be a part of a historic class of newly-elected members of Congress, but she'll bring with her bold, progressive policy ideas. I can't wait to work alongside her.
We're still grappling with the coronavirus pandemic across the country -- and we need leaders like Georgette in charge helping steer us towards a path forward.
From making sure educators are equipped to teach remotely to making sure our workers have the benefits and care they deserve (especially those on the front lines of the pandemic) to the families struggling to make ends meet with higher unemployment rates than we've seen in years -- there's a lot to fix.
I know that the outcome for San Diegans, Californians, and everyone in this country will be better with Georgette working in Congress to come up with solutions.
Team, we HAVE to make sure Georgette is elected this November. Can you join me in supporting her historic campaign for Congress by pitching in today?
DONATE
Thanks for stepping up. I'm proud to call myself a friend of Georgette's, and I can't wait until she's my colleague in Congress as well.

Hey team,
Did you catch our message from earlier this week?
We want to make sure you see it, because right now, we're in a critical moment of this race.
Election Day is just three days away, and we're just $14,763 short of our $75,000 final end-of-month goal.
If we miss this crucial fundraising goal, we won't be able to keep running our ads to combat the ridiculous falsehoods about Georgette in our opponent's shameless ads -- all paid for by the PAC that's funded by her billionaire family members.
Friend, will you rush $5 right now and help us close the gap?
DONATE
With your contribution, our people-powered campaign will make history next Tuesday -- and we will show our opponent that you can't just lie (and buy!) your way into public office.
Thank you,
Team Gómez

Hi team,
Georgette here -- and I'm writing to let you know that we're facing our final -- our biggest, our most important fundraising deadline of the entire election cycle.
People are always going to talk -- especially when an unconventional candidate like myself is running head-to-head with a self-funder. So, let's give them something to talk about.
They'll especially be talking when they hear our final end-of-month fundraising goal -- $75,000. We'll hear it all \-- “You can't raise that kind of money without PACs and big money donors...” or “The first LGBTQ+ Latina in Congress? She'll never win against a millionaire.”
Let's show them that there's no power like the people -- and our power as the people can't be stopped.
Chip in to this historic, grassroots campaign to help us meet our $75,000 goal by this weekend's deadline.

Together, we're going to show the entire country the type of candidates that are able to win in 2020. I didn't expect to run for office. Growing up a low-income, first-gen Mexican American working multiple jobs to put food on the table -- people like me don't usually end up in politics.
But here I am, thanks to you.
Every retweet and Facebook share, every virtual town hall, every lawn sign, and every donation, no matter how big or small, has shown me that we can make history. We will make history. I could be the first LGBTQ+ Latina in Congress -- thanks to you.
Together, we can show everyone that we can win this -- but I need your help. Rush in $5 or anything you can so we can raise $75,000 for this critical fundraising deadline.

GeorgetteGomez.org,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,SIGN ON: COVID-19 relief for ALL “essential” workers.,"#
Friend --
Right now, hundreds of thousands of undocumented workers in California are considered ""essential"" by our government. They pay taxes, but were completely left out of the recent stimulus bill that passed in Congress.
We are asking folks to risk their lives and work during this pandemic, but are offering no help in return. That must change:
Will you join Georgette in calling on our state and federal governments to provide relief to undocumented workers in any upcoming stimulus package? Sign the Letter
Late last week, Georgette sent a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom urging him to adopt key measures to address the needs of our undocumented communities.
Here’s some of what she’s pushing for:
- Providing individuals with immediate cash relief like everyone else
\- Allocating $10 million to community-based organizations to deliver cash benefits for groceries, rent, medicine, and more
- Broadening eligibility for the Earned Income Tax Credit to immigrants
Undocumented workers are putting their health at risk and contributing greatly to our regional economy. We cannot leave them behind, so we’re asking you to sign on to help move this forward:
Add your name to call on the state government and Congress to provide urgent assistance to undocumented workers in any upcoming relief legislation.
Yes, I will sign on
Thank you,

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,My life’s work. ,"#
Friend,
My team has sent a number of emails this week, so I wanted to take a moment and explain why these emails are so important to our campaign.
The truth is, my life's work has always been about fixing injustices in our society and improving the quality of life for our communities. Public service was never about politics or just winning a congressional race. This is about truly addressing the issues we face -- whether we’re talking about expanding affordable housing, ending poverty, achieving environmental justice, or fighting for universal health care for all.
That's why I made the decision to refuse all corporate PAC money. In fact, the vast majority of the money we raise comes from lots of individual donors making small contributions. And that usually happens in response to emails just like this one!
This is why I'm asking once again:
Will you add a $3 donation before our FEC deadline? We're trying to raise $45,000 in online contributions before June 30, and any amount you contribute will go a long way in helping us reach this mark.
If you've save your information with ActBlue Express, your contribution will be processed immediately.

Friend,
Earlier this week, our team reached out to remind you that Election Day is just under two months away, and we're going up against huge amounts of spending by our opponent and her family.
I'm not going to let that spending stop me from running -- because I know who we need in Congress, and it's not someone who's buying this seat.
I'm fighting so hard to become your representative -- because you deserve a representative that knows you.
You deserve someone who'll best represent you in Congress -- someone who's familiar with financial hardships. Someone who may look like you. Someone who takes the same public transportation as you. Someone who's willing to fight the good fight because they know what it's like to struggle, even with working multiple jobs.
That someone is me \-- and because we come from the same community with similar experiences, in Congress, I'm beholden to you and only you -- never billionaires.
Chip in $5 or whatever you can to our grassroots campaign today.

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,Not your typical candidate ,"#
Friend,
You know, I'm not your typical congressional candidate.
I didn't come from a family with money. I wasn't born into a network of connections to get me to high places. I come from a Mexican-American family who had to work three times as hard as others to get by -- because of our immigration and socioeconomic status.
Employers exploited my parents' work ethic due to their immigration status. Financially, we could barely stay afloat. At one point, there were over ten of us living in a small apartment.
And as a first-generation immigrant, I had to work multiple jobs just to get myself through college -- and to be frank, at one point college didn't even seem attainable.
But here I am -- running for Congress to be your representative that will work to address the inequities we face. Can you help me get there by donating $3 to my campaign?
DONATE
As a “not so typical” congressional candidate, you surely know the things I am not (a career politician, a candidate trying to buy the seat, an Ivy league alum with billionaire grandparents) -- but let me tell you the things that I am.
I'm a proud, longtime community organizer. I had firsthand experience with environmental racism at a very young age, which is why I went to college to study how to address those inequities. As former associate director of the Environmental Health Coalition, I led the Toxic-Free Neighborhoods Campaign to protect kids from lead paint and keep polluting industries out of residential communities.
I've also worked as a victims' advocate for survivors of domestic violence and sexual abuse and have worked to activate low propensity voters in our district.
I'm so proud of what San Diego has enabled me to work on my whole life, as a volunteer or as the City Council President. We've expanded new transit options, increased affordable housing, and so much more -- and I know I can accomplish even more for our community in Congress.
I'm ready to keep fighting for the people, from a place where I can have a greater impact and give back to the community that shaped me. Chip in to our grassroots campaign for change today.

In her last congressional run, our opponent's grandparents contributed huge sums of money to a super PAC made just for her -- and they're doing the same this time around. They've already dropped over $800,000 to support their granddaughter.

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,I’m the daughter of Mexican immigrants. ,"#
I'm elated, friend.
This morning, the Supreme Court blocked the Trump Administration from cruelly putting to end DACA protections for over 800,000 young immigrants who grew up in the United States and call this their home.
From now on when Dreamers say “home is here,” it takes on a whole new meaning.
I'm a first generation Mexican American, daughter of immigrant parents, and I know first hand that immigrants have made our community and country great, and will continue to do so. And it's why I fought so hard to protect Dreamers from deportation as San Diego’s City Council President.
But we also need to be very clear that this decision is not a permanent solution. There's much more work left to do to ensure that Dreamers who call this country home can do so on a permanent basis. In Congress, I look forward to continuing the work done to pass the Dream and Promise Act which would create a pathway to citizenship.
With Trump and the Republicans at the helm, this fight will require all hands on deck. So today, I am asking you to join me in reaffirming your commitment to passing the Dream and Promise Act to provide a clear pathway to citizenship for our dreamers.

We're coming up on some tough budget decisions.
If we don't meet our fundraising goal of $50,000 by Wednesday night, we're going to have to put Georgette on the phone with donors, rather than connecting with community members to earn their vote.

It’s been an incredible week for progressive candidates across the country.
Democrats in Kentucky and New York like Georgette who have been endorsed by Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and groups like Justice Democrats made waves in competitive primaries. In some cases they won big.

Friends --
In a moment, we’re going to ask you to make a contribution to our campaign for Congress. Things have changed significantly in our race, so we hope you’ll let us explain why your support is so important -- especially today.
TONIGHT marks our first FEC fundraising deadline of 2020. This may not surprise you, but fundraising for our campaign has been difficult lately. Georgette has been extremely busy with city work, and several of our in-person fundraising events have been cancelled.
To keep Georgette on track, we need to raise $15,000 before our end-of-quarter deadline at midnight. And in order to catch up, we’re depending on supporters like you to step up with contributions to help us reach our goal. That’s just the hard truth.
We are humbly asking if you can you make a contribution of $3 or more to help fill our fundraising gap. We are only asking because this is so important to our campaign.
DONATE $3We can’t do this without you, friend. Thank you.

Friends --
As more cities and states mandate the close of restaurants and bars to slow the spread of COVID-19, low-wage workers and small businesses are facing a significant financial strain.
These Americans should not face the burden of foreclosures or evictions from their home or places of business due to lost wages and revenue during this state of emergency.
Last night, Governor Gavin Newsom announced an executive order halting all foreclosures and evictions in California. I support this as an important first step toward protecting families and small businesses during this unstable time. However, with nearly half of all Americans living paycheck to paycheck, we must think beyond our immediate community and take action as a nation.
That is why I’m calling on Congress to follow California’s lead and pass legislation to halt all foreclosures and evictions for families and small businesses nationwide. Will you add your name to my petition? I will be sending petition signatures directly to Members of Congress. Sign the PetitionHousing is a human right, and Congress must do everything it can to protect families as we come together and take steps to overcome this crisis.
Thank you, and please stay safe.

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,Trump has no authority to postpone ,"#
Friend,
Last week, the president sent the country into a frenzy with a tweet about postponing the November 3rd election.  Trump tweeted on July 30th, 2020: With Universal Mail-In Voting \(not Absentee Voting, which is good\), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRADULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safety vote???
Let's get a couple of things straight.
1. Voting by mail increases voter turnout, makes voting more accessible, and is a cost-effective way of voting. California has run successful mail-in elections for YEARS.
2. In a pandemic, vote-by-mail is the safest option -- it would be irresponsible to require people to vote in person.
3. The United States Constitution is beyond clear: Congress determines the time, place, and manner of federal elections -- NOT the President of the United States.
Our voting rights are under attack the week of the Voting Rights Act anniversary.
We need to defend every voter's right to safely cast their ballot this year and every year. Sign on to this petition calling for the passage of the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.
President Trump's efforts to move the election when the winds are against him proves what we've known all along: He was never looking out for our best interest, only his.
That's not leadership, that's voter suppression. But this is exactly what has been happening for decades: the Voting Rights Act has been picked apart piece by piece. That is a bill that John Lewis risked his life to pass. And now, it's incumbent on all of us to make some ""good trouble"" and pass this bill.
This is urgent -- the election is less than 3 months away, and we are still at risk of having unfair elections. Sign the petition: Demand Congress pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.
SIGN THE PETITION
In the words of the late Congressman John Lewis and VRA champion, ""The right to vote is precious and almost sacred, and one of the most important blessings of our democracy. We must be vigilant in protecting that blessing.""
In solidarity,
Georgette

Team,
It's safe to say that I'm not the traditional, cookie-cutter candidate for Congress -- and that matters.
I didn't come from a family with money. I wasn't born into a network of connections and opportunities to get me where I am today. My grandparents are certainly not billionaires pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into a super PAC to buy a seat for me like my opponent’s family.
As the first LGBTQ Latina elected at the local level in San Diego, someone who grew up in the barrio, daughter of immigrant parents, I have worked three times as hard as others to be here, running for Congress.
Voices like mine are needed in Congress now more than ever -- as we face a climate crisis, record unemployment rates, and unrest around the country because of the death of our Black brothers and sisters at the hands of the police. We need people with progressive values and lived experiences that will lift people through their troubles and force Congress to care more about progressive change, not legislative bandaids.
But to get to Congress, I need your help -- can you chip $5 or anything you can to my campaign before midnight tomorrow to help elect me to Congress?
DONATE
I’ve spent my entire life dedicated to improving the community where I grew up, the schools I attended, the housing I lived in, the public transit I rode, the small businesses I frequented -- because without them, I wouldn't be where I am today. But we can and should make them better.
From community organizing to sitting on the City Council, I've worked to accomplish so much for our district. In Congress, we can achieve even more together.
Chip in $5 or anything you can to our grassroots campaign for change by the end of the month so we have what it takes to win this campaign.

We’ll cut to the chase. Time is ticking, and we now have 18 days left to make history. Georgette stands to be the first LGBTQ+ Latina representative in Congress. The power and meaningfulness in this should not be taken lightly.
On November 3rd, this incredible campaign, with your support, could make history and redefine what American politics looks like for the next few years. We cannot and should not underestimate what this campaign could mean for minority communities, for labor unions and workers, for the unemployed, for the students in the district of CA-53.
But to make sure Georgette is that leader we need, to make sure we make history, we need to close the gap on our $20,000 fundraising goal by midnight TONIGHT. We're just $4,177 away, can you pitch in $5 to close the gap?

Georgette has dedicated her life to fighting the good fight.
From her role as an activist in our district, to her decades-long work as an organizer fighting for environmental and racial justice, to taking on the Trump administration as San Diego City Council President and WINNING against their dangerous agenda, Georgette has a proven track record of showing up and showing out for her community.
Georgette knows how important it is to fight for minority and working class families. She has plans to bring about change to these vulnerable communities, but she needs your help to do that.
Georgette’s opponent is a millionaire self-funding her campaign with help from her billionaire grandparents. Not only do we need progressive policies, we also need to take big money out of American politics.
We have a huge fundraising deadline tonight at midnight. Can we count on you so we can win this election and send a strong progressive to Congress?

Thank you for being a part of the good fight. Let’s send our progressive champion to Congress come November.

Folks on the ground are fired up to win this thing.
I gotta say, I’m fired up too.
When you’re born and raised in Barrio Logan -- and fought for justice for working families your entire career -- the fire in your belly to improve lives in your community burns every day.
When immigrants like my own mom and dad are maligned by Donald Trump? I get fired up.
When hard working families are denied medical help because of exploding health care costs? I get fired up.
And when I see so many San Diegans who can’t afford housing in the city they call home? I get fired up.
I’m ready to take our fight to Washington. If you’re ready to join me, today is your last chance to make a contribution before votes are counted.
Please donate $3 or more today. We’ll put your donations right to work on our last-minute voter turnout efforts.

When you're in a position to self-fund a campaign not once, but two times around, and run for Congress in two different districts, it's clear you're not running for the right reasons. It's clear that our opponent's campaign is not about the people of CA-53. It never was.
Big money degrades our democracy -- which is why our grassroots campaign is 100% people powered.
We'll never be able to match the spending of an opponent who uses billionaire family funds for a campaign -- but we will be able to send Georgette to Congress if you keep up the work by rushing a donation of whatever you can today.

Subject: The REAL Sara Jacobs
Who is Georgette's opponent, Sara Jacobs, really?
She's a millionaire heiress, currently spending millions of her family's tech fortune to buy her way into Congress -- for the second time! She couldn't buy her way past Congressmen Mike Levin in CA-49 in 2018, so she's trying again in CA-53.
Her FEC report shows that over 86% of the more than $5 million her campaign has spent has come from her trust fund. Her wealthy family is pumping huge amounts of money into her campaign -- an advantage that our grassroots, people-funded campaign doesn't have.
We have less than two weeks until Election Day, and we have to fundraise as much as possible so Georgette can keep up against her opponent's billionaire family fund. Will you chip in $5 or more today to help get us there?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Here's another fact about our opponent: Sara Jacobs supports Trump's tax cuts for corporations (the same corporations she's invested in!) that have made billions in the pandemic while ripping off families and laying off workers.
In contrast, Georgette knows we must repeal Trump's disastrous handouts to the wealthy which have benefitted no one but the super-rich.
And in Congress, she will work against big money interests that try to influence politics for their own agenda. Instead, she'll advocate for the rest of us -- working families who are struggling to pay their bills, who need affordable housing and healthcare right now.
That's because Georgette Gómez stands for us, the working people of San Diego -- not the billionaire class. And that fighter is who we need in Congress.
If you want to see Georgette win this year and prove to everyone that you don't need a massive trust fund or corporate backers to win an election, contribute $5 or what you can to support our campaign today.
Thanks for your support, together we'll send Georgette to Congress to fight for the people who need it most.

Subject: Proud to stand with Georgette Gómez
Hello,
It's no secret that we are facing a critical moment in this country. This is the time when we need real leaders with conviction and courage in Congress.
That's why I was proud to endorse Georgette Gómez for Congress. I'm committed to helping make sure she wins — but I can't do it alone. She's counting on strong grassroots support from this team. If you can, please chip in to her campaign for Congress today.
You don't have to look far to see all the reasons why we need big, structural change in Washington — and Georgette Gómez is ready to deliver that change.
We see how Donald Trump and his Republican cronies in the Senate wouldn't lift a finger for months to help out working families by passing meaningful coronavirus relief.
We see the effects of the climate crisis — severe storms and raging wildfires hurting vulnerable communities, while Republicans deny climate change and cater to their fossil fuel industry donors.
And now, we see Trump and his Republican enablers racing to steal another Supreme Court seat to gut Roe v. Wade and rip health care away from millions of people in the middle of a pandemic.
So, here's the urgent question we face: How do we take back our democracy from the hands of this corrupt, morally bankrupt administration this November?
By electing bold leaders with integrity in Washington who will undo this administration's disastrous policies and fight for the American people — not Washington lobbyists and special interests. Leaders powered by the grassroots, not the powerful.
Georgette is a leader with the courage and conviction needed to fight for the needs of working families in Congress. Her proven track record shows her enduring commitment to take necessary action on climate change, expand affordable housing, protect Social Security and Medicare, prioritize public health, and extend much-needed relief funding for small businesses hurt by COVID-19.
But first, we need to make sure she wins this race — and grassroots donors like you will make all the difference now that we're in the final days of voting. You can power the outreach that gets this campaign over the finish line.
So, friend, if you're able to, will you support Georgette Gómez and chip in whatever you can to see her through this election?

BREAKING:
New Super PAC launches in CA-53
Super PAC will spend $370,000 to prop up Georgette’s opponent. Stand with Georgette
* * *
This is bad, team.
We just got word that an outside super PAC -- funded with undisclosed dark money -- just dropped $370,000 to prop up our opponent ahead of the March 3rd primary.
This massive expenditure will benefit our one opponent who is a known billionaire and self-funder with a track record of trying to buy seats in Congress.
Will you make a $3 donation today to help us set counter this last-minute flood of outside cash?
The timing here is not a coincidence.
Our opponents know that Georgette has consolidated the most local support and has a strong and proven track record of standing up to Trump as San Diego’s City Council President.
But they have virtually unlimited sums of money to spend against us in these final weeks. We can’t let them drown out our voices.
We need our grassroots team to step up because Georgette isn’t taking a dime of corporate PAC money. Can we count on you for $3 today?
Thank you in advance -- we’re in this together.

I'll be direct, friend.
In just a moment, I'm going to ask you to make a contribution to my campaign. Things are heating up, so I hope you'll let me explain why your donation is so important -- especially today.
Earlier this week, we got word that a super PAC supporting one of my opponents dropped a six-figure ad campaign ahead of the March primary. This news came just after we learned that this same opponent also spent $1.2 million on TV ads.
Needless to say, we're being significantly outspent, and to be honest, it's likely that won't change. We know that TV ads alone can’t win an election, but it's so important that we send a message of grassroots strength and enthusiasm to respond.
Which is why I need to ask:
Wednesday marks our final FEC fundraising deadline before the primary. Can you chip in $3 today? Our goal is to collect as many individual donations as possible to prove we have what it takes to win this race. If you've save your information with ActBlue Express, your contribution will be processed immediately.

I'm humbled that we have overwhelming local support in this race. But because our opponent is so well-funded, we are expecting this race to be very close.
And I want you to know that despite the polls being pushed around by the media, our internal data looks great. But we can’t leave anything to chance.
We have to keep running a strong grassroots campaign, and it costs money to organize volunteers across the district.
So please, chip in $3 today, it’d make a big difference in helping me reach as many voters as possible in these final weeks.
Thank you -- from the bottom of my heart.

Did you see Georgette's email yesterday?

While we're getting closer to our goal, we've still got $3,872 left to raise.
The last thing we want to do this close to the election is cut our spending. We need to be increasing our spending to make sure voters in CA-53 know what Georgette's campaign stands for -- before they turn in their mail-in ballot.
If we don't meet this goal by TONIGHT, we'll have to cut corners -- meaning fewer lawn signs, less voter outreach, smaller ad buys.
But every time we've asked for support, you've pulled through.
If you stand with Georgette and you're ready to see her in Washington, chip in $5 or anything you can to our campaign so we can go into our budget meeting tomorrow with good news.

Here's my story, friend.
My parents left Mexico and settled in Barrio Logan, CA where I was born.
They worked multiple jobs, but we still barely made ends meet. To be honest, we were poor. At one point, we had to stay with another family because we couldn’t afford rent.
In junior high, I remember helping my mom clean offices at the buildings that stand across from San Diego City Hall. I never imagined I’d be presiding as City Council President just across the street from the buildings I once worked at as a young girl.
Friend -- when I say I’m committed to addressing issues like affordable housing and income inequality -- it’s not just a talking point. I’ve lived these struggles. I know what it’s like when people say they feel the system is rigged against them.

Big news, friend.
We’re proud to announce that we’re officially up on the air with our first TV ad ahead of the primary election! If you haven’t seen it yet, you can view it here >>
Watch the ad Georgette has an extensive and proven record of achieving progressive victories and taking on Trump as San Diego’s City Council President. That’s why she has consolidated overwhelming local support in this race.
Friend, this campaign -- and our ability to run ads like this one -- is funded almost entirely by individual donors like you. Georgette doesn’t have lots of wealthy friends to call on for support. Nor is she accepting any corporate PAC contributions to this campaign.
We need $10,000 before the end-of-the week to keep this ad running across the 53rd District through election day by chipping in a donation of any amount today?  If you've save your information with ActBlue Express, your contribution will be processed immediately.

Serving my community has been my priority for my entire career. From community organizing for environmental justice to serving on the city council with a progressive agenda, I've been able to bring people to the table and get real results on climate, on police reform, on COVID relief.
This campaign is making history in so many ways, and you and I both know how hard it can be for people like me to get to positions of power. I don't have billionaire relatives and unlimited resources.
But we do have something so much stronger: We have supporters like you.

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,Climate Change ,"#
Friend,
The climate crisis is accelerating -- and it’s time we address this issue as a nation.
As we’re faced with high unemployment rates, record-breaking natural disasters, a housing crisis, and more, it’s time we address the deeply rooted inequities within the climate crisis. Most of these impacts are hardest felt in underserved communities. This is not just an environmental emergency -- it's a nationwide disaster, and that's why I believe in the power of the Green New Deal.
I’ve dedicated much of my career to addressing the climate crisis. At a young age, I developed a passion for the environment when I realized the air my neighborhood wasn’t as clean as in other areas in town. Since then I’ve always believed that no kid should be forced to breathe polluted air just because of their zip code.
Passing the Green New Deal will take the immediate action that’s needed to address the climate crisis. Add your name to our petition if you want to see the Green New Deal passed.
SIGN THE PETITION
As San Diego grows, we can and should be a model for the nation with healthy, affordable, sustainable neighborhoods for all our families. The Green New Deal takes the meaningful steps needed to address the climate emergency, including renewable energy and transportation concerns. It also addresses the need for protection of those risking their lives working in the dangerous and harmful industries. Our workers will never be left behind. By shifting from reliance on fossil fuels to a greener industry, we can empower our workers and help them thrive in a safer work environment, providing advanced protections and wages that they’ve long deserved.
As part of the work I did with the Environmental Health Coalition and now on the City Council, I’ve worked to influence our environmental policies, pushing for more bold, progressive change -- that’s why in the city of San Diego, we’re well on our way to achieving 100 percent renewable energy and cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2035.
But we can do more. I’ve long pushed for the implementation of San Diego’s landmark Climate Action Plan, and that’s why I’m advocating for the Green New Deal. Bold reform and concrete plans are what we need to fix this problem.
In Congress, I’ll continue to push for the creation of jobs in clean energy, the increase of investments in energy efficiency and technology, the investment in world-class public transportation, and the transformation of the agriculture system for more sustainable farming.
I’ve always fought and will always fight to make sure our underserved communities are the first to benefit from implemented environmental policies. These communities have been on the front lines of pollution for far too long.
The types of changes proposed in the Green New Deal will create safer work environments and bring stimulation to our economy -- all while making the air safer to breathe for us and for future generations.
There's more work to be done here in San Diego and across the country. The time to act is now. Sign the petition: The federal government must invest in the Green New Deal.
SIGN THE PETITION
I will always choose to keep fighting for a brighter, greener, more affordable and sustainable community.

Elizabeth Warren,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,Proud to stand with Georgette Gómez,"#
Hello,
It's no secret that we are facing a critical moment in this country. This is the time when we need real leaders with conviction and courage in Congress.
That's why I was proud to endorse Georgette Gómez for Congress. I'm committed to helping make sure she wins — but I can't do it alone. She's counting on strong grassroots support from this team. If you can, please chip in to her campaign for Congress today.
You don't have to look far to see all the reasons why we need big, structural change in Washington — and Georgette Gómez is ready to deliver that change.
We see how Donald Trump and his Republican cronies in the Senate wouldn't lift a finger for months to help out working families by passing meaningful coronavirus relief.
We see the effects of the climate crisis — severe storms and raging wildfires hurting vulnerable communities, while Republicans deny climate change and cater to their fossil fuel industry donors.
And now, we see Trump and his Republican enablers racing to steal another Supreme Court seat to gut Roe v. Wade and rip health care away from millions of people in the middle of a pandemic.
So, here's the urgent question we face: How do we take back our democracy from the hands of this corrupt, morally bankrupt administration this November?
By electing bold leaders with integrity in Washington who will undo this administration's disastrous policies and fight for the American people — not Washington lobbyists and special interests. Leaders powered by the grassroots, not the powerful.
Georgette is a leader with the courage and conviction needed to fight for the needs of working families in Congress. Her proven track record shows her enduring commitment to take necessary action on climate change, expand affordable housing, protect Social Security and Medicare, prioritize public health, and extend much-needed relief funding for small businesses hurt by COVID-19.
But first, we need to make sure she wins this race — and grassroots donors like you will make all the difference now that we're in the final days of voting. You can power the outreach that gets this campaign over the finish line.
So, friend, if you're able to, will you support Georgette Gómez and chip in whatever you can to see her through this election?

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,What my campaign is about:,"#
Friend --
When I first ran for City Council in 2016, I remember being told that I didn’t have enough money to win. I was outspent 3:1 by my opponent, and many assumed I didn’t stand a chance against the other well-funded candidates in the field.
I won that race anyway.
I won because I elevated the real issues impacting our community -- affordable housing and poverty, transportation, jobs, and environmental justice. That won’t change now that I am running for Congress. This campaign is still about delivering results for San Diego families who deserve a fair shake.
There are a lot of parallels in my 2020 run. I'm running against a self-funder who -- in less than two years -- has run for Congress in two different districts spending millions. She lost her 2018 race, and now she's trying to buy this district.
Friend, I don’t have the wealthy donors to fund this campaign, but I have you. And it’s my promise that this campaign will always be about the change we can make together and for each other. That’s how we win, and it’s why your support is so crucial:
Can you chip in a donation of $10 today? I have a big end-of-quarter fundraising deadline at the end of this month, and I’m depending on grassroots support to fund this campaign.
With your support, I’ll go to Washington and keep fighting for our families, for our communities, for every single one of our residents who deserves the freedom and respect that this great country promises.
From the bottom of my heart -- thank you.

Friend,
The root of the progressive movement we carry on today comes from the work of organized labor unions and workers fighting for fairness and equality in the workplace. Today, on the anniversary of the Fair Labor Standards Act going into effect, we are reflecting on the long way we have come in establishing rights and standards for workers.
But we need to do more. This year especially, we've seen how important essential workers have been in keeping us safe, healthy, and prepared for a disastrous pandemic.
Georgette's been at the forefront of the fight for fair wages and workers' rights -- and as the candidate with a coalition of endorsements and support from labor groups across the state and country, it's clear that she's the candidate we need in Congress.
We have just TEN days left to elect our champion for workers to Congress. Chip in $5 or whatever you can -- because we NEED the labor candidate to represent us in Congress >>

There is no one more qualified to take on this fight. That's why Georgette is endorsed by the National Education Association (our nation's largest labor union), the California Labor Federation, the Laborers' International Union, and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees -- among so many others.
This fight is personal to Georgette -- she knows what it's like to have to work multiple minimum wage jobs just to get by. She's seen the difference between health care coverage for people in union jobs compared to non-union jobs. That's why she's fought long and hard for the strengthening of labor unions, pushing for quality-of-life benefits and for fair and livable wages.
Rush a donation of $5 or whatever you can so we can send Georgette -- THE labor candidate -- to Congress. We're running out of time to make this happen.

Subject: We ended carotid restraint in San Diego. Now, let’s end it nationally.
Friend --
Earlier today we saw a President continue to incite, demonize and divide. In San Diego, we’re going in the other direction – united, focused on fighting for justice and determined to keep the peace.
I’m proud to announce that San Diego is one of the first cities in America to take direct action to ensure that the tactics that led to George Floyd’s tragic death are never used here.
Today, the San Diego Police Department is ending use of the carotid restraint – a chokehold technique many of us have worked for years to ban.
This is an important step forward for police reform, building trust between communities and law enforcement and it’s long past time.
We’re putting the passions of the protests towards real progress for racial justice, fair policing and upholding the dignity of every San Diegan.
We need to take the next step. Please sign my petition calling on Congress to implement a nationwide ban on carotid restraint.
Chokeholds incite at a time when we need to de-escalate. A knee on the neck ended the life out of George Floyd. And in San Diego, we are determined to ensure that never happens here.
To the peaceful protesters: I know you’re angry – and I’m angry too. I want you to know that we hear your voices and we are taking action. And there’s more reform to come.
And to the San Diego Police: We need you to de escalate, not escalate, in these highly charged moments. And I want to thank our Chief of Police David Nisleit for helping implement this important reform.
San Diego – please stay safe tonight. Please stay united tonight. And please know that our work for justice, dignity and respect for all continues.
From the bottom of my heart,
Georgette Gómez

Friend --
Our nation’s health care workers still need urgent support.
Earlier this month, we sent an email letting you know that hundreds of thousands of nurses and health care workers in San Diego and beyond lacked the appropriate protections to keep themselves and their patients safe.
15 days have passed and unfortunately, we have not seen enough progress. Too many health care workers are still being forced to work in unsafe conditions -- many have been infected by COVID-19 due to a lack of protective equipment.
Will you please join us in calling on lawmakers to support policies that keep our front line workers safe? Protect Health Care Workers
Friend, we can’t let up in the fight to protect those who are protecting us, so Georgette is co-sponsoring a national petition demanding our health care workers receive:
» Protective gear (PPE) like N95 respirator masks and face shields
» Child care so they can do their jobs knowing that their child is safe
» Paid sick leave to ensure they don’t won’t lose pay if they need time off
Sign on to tell lawmakers to support policies that keep our front line workers safe >>

Friend,
One hundred years ago today, women earned the right to vote in this country.
In the century since then, women now vote at higher rates than men. Women are running for office at growing rates, increasing representation at all levels of government.
And as we celebrate this historic day and the massive impact it had on modern society, we must not neglect the raw and complicated history behind it.
The harsh reality is that the passage of the 19th Amendment was primarily to grant upper class white women the right to vote. The fight for the right to vote left out a significant portion of the country's female population -- lower and working class women, Trans women, Black women, Native American women, Latinx women, and Asian women continued to face various forms of voter suppression, even after the expansion of suffrage.
We are still living in a country in which women of color continue to be discriminated against, both inside and outside the voting booth. Multiple states have passed voter suppression measures to block the impacts of certain voting blocs, including women of color.
Besides the voting booth -- women of color continue to be paid significantly less than their white women colleagues.
We won't allow this to continue.
There is still so much work to be done to achieve equitable access, rights, and compensation for women -- especially women of color -- across the country. Can you pledge to support, empower, and elect women of color this year and beyond?
SIGN THE PLEDGE
With one of the most important elections of our lives coming up, we need to make sure we do everything in our power to lift women of color up and increase representation and inclusivity in our government.
As we continue to make our way through this campaign, we hope we can count on your support. We hope we can count on you to stand with all women of color -- especially those who are running for office!
In solidarity,
Georgette Gómez

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,SIGN ON: It’s time for national paid sick leave.,"#
Friends --
The public health emergency caused by the COVID-19 virus has put the spotlight on how we treat employees in this country who are forced from work due to medical reasons.
Right now, we are correctly encouraging workers to stay home if they are feeling ill, yet there is no recourse in place to make up for lost wages.
And this is not just about Coronavirus. Every year, millions of American workers still go to work despite being ill -- not because they want to, but because missing a paycheck could be devastating for their families.
The United States is the only developed nation without a national policy on paid sick leave. This would be a game-changer for our economy, and it would give families the freedom to care for themselves without risking their financial security.
Can you add your name to my petition? Tell Congress that it’s time to pass a national paid sick leave plan to support American workers and keep our economy strong. Sign the PetitionFriend, I think it’s shameful that President Trump is considering a $2 billion bailout for fossil fuel companies who have been impacted by this emergency.
The true victims are the millions of workers struggling without sick pay — not fossil fuel executives. Our country’s failure on sick leave is hurting American families and that is the true detriment to our economy.
Sign the petition and urge Congress to pass legislation to provide national paid sick leave.
Thank you,

Friend,
Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee is starting its hearings to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.
This is just plain wrong.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away just 24 days ago, and Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, and Republican leaders are trying to shove this anti-choice, anti-health care judge onto the highest court in our country.
She will make decisions that will affect our lives in ways we never could have imagined. Our rights are at risk. We can't stand idly by while this happens.
In Congress, Georgette will fight tirelessly to enshrine some of our most important rights into law and will stand up to Republicans trying to take away our health care and access to women's health choice. Chip in $5 or anything you can today to her campaign to get this progressive fighter to Washington.

In the midst of a pandemic in which so many of us have lost loved ones, that the Republican Party is continuing to chip away at our access to affordable health care is unacceptable.
If she makes it onto the Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett will work to repeal the Affordable Care Act. That's just the beginning of what a conservative Supreme Court will do.
We are living through a state of disruption, and we must not rest -- we have to do all we can to halt this confirmation. That means electing strong progressive leaders like Georgette who will pour her heart out to stop injustices like this.
Rush a contribution to Georgette's campaign for Congress today to have another bold champion for our rights and health care in Washington D.C. fighting for us.
Thanks for stepping up. We have to do all that we can to stop this threat to democracy.

Friend,
The countdown to Election Day is on -- and with just 63 days left to campaign and even fewer until ballots appear in voters' mailboxes, it means the world to me to see so many grassroots supporters powering this campaign.
This scrappy campaign is hard at work to prove that we deserve to be in Congress representing CA-53. Our bold progressive policy plans, our unshakable commitment to working families, and our love and care for this district are insurmountable.
There's so much happening in this country. Our schools are trying to re-open to let students back in. Our Black neighbors and friends continue to demand justice and respect from police. Our workers, both employed and unemployed, are trying to get our economy back on track. Everyone, especially my Latinx friends and family, is trying to survive the coronavirus pandemic -- despite being disproportionately impacted by this virus.
The one constant over the past few months is the will of the people and our grassroots efforts cannot be stopped. We've seen the wave of the progressive movement across the country, and we're going to see it here, too.
We only have a little bit of time left in this campaign -- and we have a lot of work to do.
Thank you for believing in me, the same way I believe in you. The same way I believe in us.
Talk soon,

Friend,
Serving my community has been my priority for my entire career. From community organizing on behalf of environmental justice to serving on the city council with a progressive agenda, I've worked SO hard to bring change, relief, and prosperity to San Diego.
This year alone, the city council has been able to pass bold, progressive policies during these difficult times.
We just passed new protections for workers in the midst of a pandemic. Expanded paid sick leave and efforts to rehire and retain staff that had been laid off due to pandemic-related closure are just some of the latest provisions we've put in place to make the lives of our hard-working San Diegans a little easier. Our workers, especially those on the front lines of the pandemic, deserve our support more than ever before.
We've also seen the San Diego Housing Commission allocate $46 million towards creating affordable housing, and we've worked to extend rent moratoriums to make sure no one fears losing their home during this economic crisis.
I'm so proud of what we've accomplished -- and I am more determined than ever before to bring my bold, progressive agenda to Congress. We will make our economy work for the people again.
But to get to Congress, I need your support. Chip in $5 or whatever you can to help meet one of our most important fundraising goals yet by midnight tonight -- so we can do even more together for CA-53.

I already have a bold agenda of policies I will start advocating for on day one on the job in Congress.
We should be investing in public health. The coronavirus crisis makes clear why it's so urgent to ensure affordable health care for everyone. We've seen the harsh impacts in underserved, underinsured communities who have felt the virus' vicious impact most severely, and we need to move towards Medicare-for-All to make sure everyone is covered.
We should be investing in jobs and infrastructure. Working families are struggling through the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression. This crisis demands urgent, bold investments in jobs, infrastructure, student debt relief, and a fair economy -- and that will be one of my biggest priorities when I get to Congress.
Together, we've been able to achieve so much for our community -- and we can do so much more when I get to Congress. Can you chip in $5 or anything you can by midnight tonight to help me get there?
Thank you for joining me in this fight -- because my name's not the only thing on the ballot. It's our future.

Hi there! I’m Naomi, Georgette's Finance Director.
My job is to make sure Georgette has the resources she needs to win this race.
I’m checking in today because Wednesday marks our last major FEC fundraising deadline before the primary on March 3. This deadline is big because last week we got word that a super PAC supporting one of our opponents dropped over $650,000 on TV ads.
That’s a ton, so we set a goal of collecting the most grassroots donations we possibly can before Wednesday's deadline in order to fight back. We still need some help reaching our goal:

That's a far cry from how our billionaire, self-funding opponent is financing their campaign, but we refuse to let that put us at a disadvantage.
We can keep up with the flood of outside cash coming to our district, but it's going to take all of us to do it:

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,Breonna Taylor,"#
Friend,
It’s with a heavy heart that I write to you in response to failure to charge police officers in Breonna Taylor’s death.
In anticipation of the decision and potential protests downtown, the mayor of Louisville had declared a state of emergency for the area just two days ago -- and like all of you, I felt the feeling of worry, the hope of justice for Breonna Taylor slowing fading.
Then today, what we feared happened. No charges for two of the officers, and charges for the third only on damage to Breonna Taylor’s neighbors’ apartment.
Justice has not been served. As we and our ancestors have chanted for years: No justice, no peace.
Lately, it’s been so difficult to keep our heads up. To have faith in our democracy. And today, it’s painful beyond words to find out that our justice system has shown once again that equal justice under law remains a powerful aspiration -- but not yet a reality for all in our country.
This is why we say #BlackLivesMatter. It’s why we #SayHerName.
We owe it to Breonna Taylor to keep fighting for justice. For her family, friends, and community -- we owe it to them to keep up the fight.
Condemning police brutality is not something I will ever be silent about -- that’s why right here in San Diego, I’ve introduced initiatives to move services out of police officer’s job descriptions and into the hands of social workers and to reallocate funding directly into our communities -- especially our Black and brown communities.
For too long, we’ve ignored the bias in our justice system. And Breonna Taylor’s case is one of the many that prove the injustices that exist within our system.
Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly, Detective Myles Cosgrove, and former detective Brett Hankison murdered Breonna Taylor. That’s exactly how they should be charged -- as murderers.
Demanding justice for Black lives is something I’ve never been silent about, and I don’t plan on stopping now.
I know this is tough \-- but we can’t allow Breonna’s death to be in vain. We’ve got to continue this fight for her and her family. She deserves justice.
Breonna Taylor, say her name.
I extend my deepest condolences to Breonna’s family and friends -- and though it will only be cold comfort, police accountability is something I tackled right here in San Diego and is something I’ll tackle on the national level when elected to Congress this November.
Wishing everyone peace and justice,
Georgette

This email is only for those fortunate enough to have a steady income during these tough times. These are not easy words to write at this moment, but the truth is we need your support -- now more than ever.
As you can imagine, we have radically shifted how we are operating our campaign for Congress. Most notably, we have cancelled in-person fundraisers. That has required us to rethink how to raise the funds we need to continue to fight for the progressive, humanitarian values we believe in.
So much has changed, but the amount required to make a successful bid for Congress has not. And right now, running a competitive, well-funded campaign means raising another $15,000 before our end-of-quarter deadline hits on Tuesday.
So we have to ask:
If you are able, can you please contribute $3 or more to Georgette’s campaign today? Not only will you help us meet our FEC fundraising goal, you’ll help us send a powerful message that we’re still as committed as ever to our shared progressive values.
We can’t do this without you, friend. Thank you.

Friend,
It’s been a tough year.
So many of us have lost friends and family due to the coronavirus. A couple of months ago, we lost Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights hero who brought so much to our nation. This past weekend, we lost Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
We’re here to remind you that it is okay to be sad. With Donald Trump rushing a new Supreme Court justice, with no end in sight for the coronavirus pandemic, with so much uncertainty ahead -- it’s okay to be afraid.
But what’s not okay is giving up. Losing hope. We can’t give up.
There are leaders in Congress leading the fight for social justice, for workers’ rights, for economic fairness for everyone. There are leaders who will be progressive champions for us all, who will stand up to Republicans trying to steal a Supreme Court seat from us. Georgette will be one of those leaders.
We need to get her to Congress to protect and continue John Lewis and RBG’s work. We’ve got a serious goal of $50,000 for the final FEC deadline of this election that we can’t fall short of -- chip in whatever you can here.

We cannot and will not give in. We won’t be discouraged -- because that’s what Donald Trump and his followers want. They want us to give up so they can plague the country with their misogynist, homophobic, racist agenda.
Georgette will not stand by and let that happen.
By giving to our campaign we can and will make sure that women’s rights, civil rights, LGBTQ+ rights, voting rights, and so much more are protected.
The time has never been more urgent -- and with our biggest FEC deadline yet, we can’t risk missing our $50,000 fundraising goal. Chip in $5 to this campaign so Georgette can uphold and protect our heroes’ legacies in Congress.
DONATE
Together, we’ll send Georgette to Congress and ensure that John Lewis, RBG, and all our loved ones lost to COVID-19 are remembered.

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,re: Elizabeth Warren,"Hello friend,
I wanted to make sure you saw the good news that I’ve been endorsed by Senator Elizabeth Warren!
It's been a somber couple of months. But our campaign is working hard, and Elizabeth Warren's decision to get involved in this race is huge. Senator Warren has been a fierce advocate for working people, and no one is tougher when it comes to holding big banks and Wall Street accountable.
I’m ready to join the fight for progressive change in Congress, but I can’t get there with endorsements alone. Winning this race is going to require an unprecedented, local grassroots movement.
We’re ramping up our voter outreach across San Diego. If you haven’t yet, help us build on the momentum of this endorsement by chipping in $3 today.

Friend -- It’s Naomi, Georgette’s Finance Director.
First, I want to thank you for supporting Georgette for Congress. With you, and thousands of other progressives in our community, Georgette is heading into Super Tuesday with incredible momentum. But with 6 days until primary day, Georgette still needs funds so our team can continue getting the word out about her historic campaign.
This request is more important now than ever. Yesterday, we got word that our multi-millionaire, self-funding opponent spent a massive sum on deceitful ads supporting a Republican candidate in order to hurt Georgette’s chances of advancing to the General Election.
We’ve set a goal of raising $60,000 in the next four days and I promised Georgette that we will reach it. This is essential if she is going to win on Tuesday, and we are counting on your support. Can you chip in today?
If you've save your information with ActBlue Express, your contribution will be processed immediately.

Right now, we are running a crucial communications campaign — on the doors, in mailboxes, and on computers and phones across the district.

Friend,
All I can say is: Wow.
As if 2020 wasn't hectic enough, these past few weeks have certainly felt like an emotional rollercoaster ride. Between losing RBG and Trump's nomination of a radical right-wing justice, as well as the failure to charge the police who killed Breonna Taylor, it’s easy to lose sight of the good things.
That's why I wanted to send you a quick email to thank you -- because amidst all the turmoil, you still took the time to support our campaign. Every time you chipped in and every time you watched our ads or attended a virtual event has helped our campaign efforts tremendously.
It can be hard to see the light with all the political chaos going on in our country, but it's amazing to see the power behind a people-powered, people-funded campaign.
Every step of the way, you've stepped up and helped us succeed. Which is why I'm making another ask of you: Can you sign up to volunteer with our campaign?
There's still plenty of work to be done -- so please, can you join us next Saturday, October 10th, for our volunteer rally?
RSVP
In the face of misogyny, racism, and hatred that Trump has fueled our country with over the years, we can't lose sight of what's most important.
November 3rd.
November 3rd is so close.
Until then, we've got to keep the pressure on the Trump administration -- they know that they're losing, and that's exactly why they're rushing a Supreme Court nominee, a lifetime appointment to pursue their dangerous agenda.
All the protests, all the petitions, all of the fundraising efforts for campaigns around the country -- we've got to keep it up.
Can you help our campaign by signing up to volunteer?
Yes! RSVP to the campaign rally on October 10th at 10 a.m. PT.
No, but I can donate to the campaign to power voter turnout efforts.
The future of this country and the future of our lives all depend on how these next few weeks play out.
Let's keep it up, team.

Friend --
We're officially two weeks from the March 3rd Primary Election, so I thought this was as good an opportunity as any to remind folks what I am fighting for.
I'm often asked:
“Why are you running? Why would you want to join a Congress that is so divided?”
The truth is, I feel a responsibility to run -- especially right now.
As San Diego's City Council President, we’ve proven that it’s possible for Democrats and Republicans to come together and get the job done -- on transit, affordable housing, and protecting our environment. And despite what some naysayers may want you to believe, we do not need to sacrifice our progressive values to do that.
I’ve made it my mission to keep the focus of our work squarely on the quality of life of all San Diegans. That’s something that we can ALL get behind. And that's the approach I'll take in our fight for progress on Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and a comprehensive immigration reform deal.
With two weeks left, I’m working overtime to make sure we’ve reached every voter with my message. As you know, your contributions are crucial to our efforts to reach voters in our community. Will you chip in a quick donation to help power our team?

Team,
Our moment is now. As I type, ballots are being sent out to millions of Californians.
It's time to show the country what type of candidates are able to win in 2020. Growing up a low-income, first-gen Mexican American who started working as a teenager to put food on my family's table -- people like me don't usually end up in politics.
Our campaign has hit a crucial point in the election cycle, and now more than ever, we need to get our message out to the voters who are sending out their ballots right now. When voters hear what this movement is about, what we stand for, and what we will do for them in Congress -- they support us.
But our time is limited, and we need your help to make sure that our efforts do not go to waste.
We're just $4,627 away from hitting our goal to make sure we can keep our voter outreach efforts up. Can you chip in $5 or anything you can today?

I am a daughter of Mexican immigrants, a first-generation American who was born in the Barrio, and I'm now president of the San Diego City Council, one of the largest cities in the country.
I am part of the immigrant community, which is a great honor and a great responsibility as a leader in politics. Representation is so important -- if we are not represented at the table, the issues that affect our community are not being addressed or resolved in Washington.
I'm ready to represent and ensure that the problems our community is facing are addressed, like immigration reform and economic issues, people living paycheck-to-paycheck.
But unfortunately, our campaign finance system is plagued by big money, and this race is a prime example with my wealthy opponent and her grandparents spending well into the seven figures to try and buy her a seat in Congress.
The good news is that when voters are informed about my background and plans, we win. And that's where you come in.
All the time we've spent has led up to this moment. Let's make the most of it -- chip in $5 or anything you can now so we can finish strong.

We don't have to tell you what's at stake this election, because every single person in this country has had to bear the burdens of Donald Trump's poor decision-making, his hateful stances, and his gross incompetence.
That's why it's more important than ever that we elect Georgette to Congress. We need leaders who will stand up for what's right, who will work for workers, for families, for everyone.
That is why Georgette has the support of such fearless advocates for progressive values, for economic and social justice, for workers' rights. It is a true testament to the type of leader she is. We need someone like her to stand up to the bullies like Donald Trump and his followers in Congress.

Friends --
We’re sure you have heard the news that unmarked and illegal campaign mailers from a “mysterious” outside group have been sent out to voters promoting one of our opponents.
What’s clear is that our opponent Sara Jacobs stands to benefit from these illegal mailers the most. Her campaign should denounce them, but it’s very likely it was orchestrated by the super PAC aligned with her campaign -- the one funded exclusively by her billionaire grandparents.
We don’t know about you, but we’re getting a little tired of billionaires throwing their weight around to buy elections. And we certainly never expect this to happen in our own backyard:
We only have a few days to fight back, so we set a goal of raising $60,000 for last-minute digital and field outreach before Super Tuesday. Right now, we are 32% of the way there. Can you help close the gap?
Donate
Trust us, Georgette would much rather be talking about the issues that matter most for our community in these final days:
Issues like improving transit and housing access in San Diego, and how we can leverage the federal government to protect our environment and keep polluters in check.
But right now -- in light of this news -- it is so important that we close the gap on this goal.

Right now, our worst-case scenario looks like this campaign cutting spending between now and Election Day. Voters won’t get to know the truth about this 100% people-powered, people-funded campaign. Then, we end up with a millionaire representing a working-class district -- another breach of democracy with a candidate who bought her seat.
Our best-case scenario looks historic. Because if we win on Tuesday, we will have another champion for bold, progressive policies in Congress. A champion for workers’ rights, for health care for all, for affordable housing, for all the policies that will make the difference in people’s lives.

Friends --
As we all adjust our lives to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, I understand that there is a lot of uncertainty. But I want you to know that I am doing everything in my power as Council President to keep San Diego families safe and prevent this crisis from getting worse.
Tomorrow, I'm calling for an emergency City Council meeting to officially ratify the Mayor’s State of Emergency Declaration in San Diego. This is an important step, but we must also act immediately to protect those facing economic turmoil as a result of this crisis. That’s why I have also proposed additional steps to protect our residents.
Some of the measures I am proposing include:
\- An immediate freeze on residential evictions due to nonpayment
\- A freeze on mortgage foreclosures on Housing Authority properties
\- A freeze on small business evictions from commercial leases
\- Providing relief to individuals and landlords suffering from loss of income
\- Ensure that we enforce paid sick leave and minimum wage ordinances
\- Stopping all utility shut-offs due to nonpayment
\- A halt on ICE operations in sensitive areas such as hospitals and clinics.
This is a difficult time, but I am so proud of the San Diego residents who have done their part to help mitigate the spread of this virus. Social distancing, practicing good hygiene, staying home — it’s a shared effort that requires everyone’s buy-in.
I will continue to monitor this situation closely, but in the meantime, I would like to direct your attention to the San Diego COVID-19 Community Response Fund, which is deploying resources to community-based organizations at the frontlines of the coronavirus outbreak in San Diego.
This fund is focused on three areas: food security, rental and utility assistance, and income replacement or gap funding. If you can, please consider making a contribution to support this urgent work >>
More soon,

Hi!
It’s Election Day.
So much at stake, and I know that you’re just as eager as I am to put and end to Trump’s hateful policies and to advance a progressive agenda to enact universal health care for all, a Green New Deal, and to secure affordable housing for all San Diegans.
A lot of the power to make these changes resides in Congress, which is why I’ve thrown my full support behind Georgette Gómez -- the progressive candidate running for Congress in CA-53. Will you join me?

Team,
With 8 days to go our opponent is running scared.
She is spreading lies left and right in a desperate bid to try to buy a seat in Congress. Attacks ads filled with misinformation and baseless assumptions that are straight up offensive are being backed by her and her family's super PAC. They're trying to undermine the momentum we've built by buying this seat, but we aren't going to let them.
Meanwhile, Georgette is putting forward bold, achievable policy plans that will make the lives of so many better. Her record as a community organizer and as president of the City Council shows what she is capable of -- delivering for the people on health care for all, affordable housing, climate change, and more.
We have just over a week left to reach as many voters as we can in CA-53 and set the record straight.
Now more than ever, it's crucial that we share Georgette's message with folks across the district so they know what our campaign stands for -- and not the lies being spread by our opponent.
Friends, chip in $5 or whatever you can so we've got the resources to fight back.

Unlike our opponent, Georgette does not have the advantage of being born into a rich, billionaire family, which is why we turn to you -- our grassroots supporters. Because Georgette's running for you, and no one else.
Even though we don't have the financial advantage in this race, we wouldn't change a thing \-- because we're running an honest, 100% people-powered, people-funded campaign. No amount of money can compare to our movement, our hunger, or our drive for change. Nothing can compare to our collective dedication to advancing this democracy to what it should have been all along.
It's never been clearer: Georgette is the candidate of the people.
We're gearing up towards the end of the month -- the final end-of-month fundraising deadline of the entire election, and we need to raise as much money as possible. Could you chip in $5 or whatever you can and help to reach our goal of $75,000 so that we can help Georgette finish strong?

These past few months have been quite the journey -- watching Georgette's historic run unfold and seeing her on the brink of becoming the first LGBTQ+ Latina in Congress.
This wouldn't be possible without you.

Folks,
This is it -- we are running out of time to connect with undecided voters in this district, and there are just a few days left to cast their ballots. Polls show a big chunk of voters in this district are STILL undecided.
We are spending the final days of this campaign reaching out to these crucial voters -- the folks we need to cast their ballot for Georgette in order to win this race and elect a bold, progressive leader for CA-53.
But to reach them all, we need a last-minute boost of campaign contributions. The costs of voter contact can add up, and if we want to get every voter out to the polls, we need your support now.
To make sure we can get in touch with as many San Diegan voters today and tomorrow as we can, we need to raise an extra $10,000. Can you pitch in $5 or anything you can today so that we can let these critically important voters know what Georgette stands for and why they should vote for her?

Friend --
As you read this, super PAC money is being dumped into the race for California's 53rd district at an alarming rate. It's likely this PAC’s funding is coming from a wealthy billionaire who is spending boatloads of cash to swing this election for my opponent.
Like it or not, that is the reality we are facing.
Friend, I don’t believe that's how we create meaningful change for working families in our community. If we want to advance our progressive values, that is a fight that needs to happen from the bottom up -- not the top down.
That is how I worked to end toxic lead exposure in Barrio Logan as a community organizer. It's how I overcame being outspent to win a city council seat and then become the first LGBTQ Latina elected as City Council President.
And with your help, it's how we'll make history and win the race for CA-53.
Tomorrow night marks our final FEC fundraising deadline before the primary. Can you chip in $3 today? Winning this race -- against the odds -- is going to take unprecedented grassroots support.
Thank you -- from the bottom of my heart,

“Betsy DeVos sued for seizing wages during pandemic”
Stand up to DeVos
* * *
285,000.
That’s the number of student loan borrowers in this country who had their wages garnished by Betsy DeVos in March because they fell behind on making loan payments.
This was happening despite the fact that Congress called for suspension of wage garnishment during the COVID-19 crisis. DeVos initially announced she’d implement Congress’ wishes, but new evidence -- and a lawsuit filed against DeVos -- shows that garnishments continued during the crisis.
At a time when millions are out of work and struggling, the idea that wages are being garnished is cruel and highlights the need for bold student debt reform.
Can you sign our petition calling on Betsy DeVos and the DOE to return all garnished wages and end this practice immediately?
Stand up to DeVosThis pandemic has exposed the need for new investments in the American people.
It also highlights how important it is that we continue fighting for progressive policies such as cancelling all student debt outright to help jumpstart our economy.
We can get this done, but it starts with holding bad actors like DeVos accountable.
Sign the petition to stand up to DeVos >>

We’re approaching the most pivotal moment of this entire campaign.
We’ve got 20 days until Election Day, and our opponent has poured her and her family’s millions of dollars into funding her campaign.
That's not the way Georgette is running her campaign.
She knows what it’s like to have to work multiple jobs to pay for college. She knows what it’s like to think about having to choose between going to the doctor or paying rent. She knows what it’s like seeing the rich getting richer while the little guys are barely making ends meet.
That’s why it’s so important that we get her to Congress -- because she gets it. As she has for her entire career, she’s going to fight the good fight until the people in this country get what they deserve.
It’s crucial we have a progressive champion to stand up for us in CA-53. Rush a donation of $5 or whatever you can RIGHT NOW so we crush our midmonth fundraising goal of $20,000 >>

I just wrapped a City Council meeting where, in partnership with Mayor Faulconer, we unanimously passed a sweeping legislation package to mitigate the financial hardships facing San Diego citizens and small businesses due to the COVID-19 crisis.
The package includes the following five pieces:
* A temporary moratorium on evictions of residents who cannot pay rent
* A temporary moratorium on evictions of small businesses that cannot pay leases
* A prohibition on evicting tenants who reside in San Diego Housing Commission controlled apartments
* A pledge to work with banks and lenders to halt foreclosures on properties whose owners are unable to pay mortgages
* Establishes a $6 million Small Business Relief Fund to support local businesses
I will continue to keep you informed of any other developments. I also encourage you to follow us on Twitter and Facebook where I post regular updates about how you can do your part to keep your city safe.

Friend,
Can you believe it? Election Day is TOMORROW.
For over a year now, we have been working tirelessly to show this district why we are the campaign best suited to serve our district in Congress.
This has been a grassroots campaign through and through. We are powered by grassroots contributions -- people chipping in $5, $15, $50 because they believe in the power of this progressive campaign.
The broad coalition of supporters we've built is inspiring. From local, state, and national labor unions, to progressive elected champions like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, to the California Democratic Party -- the movement behind this campaign is powerful and diverse.
Not to mention all the press attention we've gotten nationwide. Appearing with other candidates who could make history on MSNBC, Univision, and NBC News has been an incredible opportunity as well. In 2020, we have the opportunity to make our Congress even more diverse and representative of our country's electorate than ever before.
All of this is to say, thank you, team, for being on this incredible journey with us.
For one of the last times this election cycle, I want to ask -- can you chip in to this 100% people-powered, people funded campaign, before the polls close tomorrow?

This year has not been easy -- but still, we came together to work for a better future. Thousands of people across the nation came together to demand institutional change and justice for our Indigenous, Brown, and Black communities. Amidst the coronavirus pandemic, we've practiced social distancing and worn masks to protect our family, friends, neighbors. We've run community food banks and distribution centers across the district, and on the City Council, we've worked to ease the burdens of San Diegan small businesses and families.
With a President who's done so much to divide us, we still came together in ways we never knew we could -- and that is something to be proud of.
Even in this campaign alone, you proved that the people do have the power. Thousands of you have made contributions these past few months that allowed us to push for the progressive change we need. Whether it was advocating for the Green New Deal, pushing for Medicare-For-All or LGBTQ+ rights, the thousands of you have done more for change than any million-dollar donor or corporation could do.
We're so close to the finish line, team, and we've come so far -- that's why we can't slow down now, not with so much on the line. We can't have any regrets.
I'm overwhelmingly prepared to fight for the issues that affect working families and people like you when I'm in Congress -- never beholden to giveaways from corporations who want me to vote in their interest. Because that's how politics should be: by the people, for the people.
Our historic and progressive campaign can and will win this thing tomorrow -- we just need your help one last time. Chip in before it's too late.

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,Let’s set the record straight ,"#
Friend,
My opponent released an attack ad last night comparing us to Donald Trump and accusing us of using “Trump tactics.”
Here’s what we’re not going to do: Attack her back using false claims and accusations.
Here’s what we are going to do: Talk about reality. The truth. Where I stand as your candidate and about the campaign that we’ve built, together.
Let’s get one thing straight -- I have nothing in common with the President of the United States.
Donald Trump has done nothing but protect big corporations and the top 1%, helping the rich get richer while the poor stay poor. He is a misogynistic, homophobic, racist individual who uses his platform to advance an agenda of hatred and divisiveness.
But me? I am a proud, first generation Mexican-American with humbling life experience. From growing up with immigrant parents and adapting to a completely new way of life here, it’s a unique experience with life-changing moments -- an experience that immigrant families face across the entire country.
Donald Trump doesn’t know what that’s like. My opponent? She doesn’t know what it’s like either.
I didn’t grow up wealthy. I wasn’t born into a rich family. I worked multiple jobs from the time I was in high school to put food on the table and afford my tuition at San Diego State University. Donald Trump, however, was privileged enough to attend an Ivy League and was “gifted” $1 million to start his own business. My opponent was also fortunate enough to attend an Ivy League school, lives off the passive income generated by her family’s wealth, and is claiming the same real estate tax write-offs that let Donald Trump only pay $750 in taxes.
But guess what? I wouldn’t change a thing. I wouldn’t change anything about my life experiences because then I wouldn’t be where I’m at right now -- running to be your Congresswoman in CA-53.
If things were different, I wouldn’t know the struggles of so many working-class people who get manipulated by the millionaires and billionaires of this country. Who wonder where the next meal may come from, or if their parents will come home from work or be taken by the border patrol -- I’ve been there. But people who’ve known money their entire lives? Once again, they don’t know what it’s like.
But still, I wouldn’t change a thing.
Today, I’m proud to be running for CA-53 and set to be the first LGBTQ+ Latina in Congress. Although I’m an unconventional candidate, unconventional is what we need -- not more politicians who have only come to Congress to play partisan politics.
I’m different, and I’m here to represent you and only you.

TeamGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,🚨 POLL ALERT 🚨,"#
Hey team --
We have breaking news -- an internal poll of CA-53 shows that when voters hear about Georgette's record and her story, they support her and she wins.
We have the tools to succeed and win this -- but we need your help.
To make sure voters know about Georgette's bold policy stances, her proven record, and her story as a first-generation LGBTQ Latina, we need to raise $10,000 by August 31. Chip in $5 right now!
Here's a bit of insider information for you, because you’re a part of this team: Right now, our opponent is polling a few points ahead of us -- until we let voters know about Georgette's record. Then Georgette wins.
It's simple -- we know what it will take to win this seat, but it's going to take a huge fundraising push to give us what we need for the next 2 months.
So, what do you say? Can you chip in $5 or anything you can to this people-powered campaign?

TeamGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,We have a choice ,"#
Friend,
Our election is all about choices.
Choices that could literally shift the current system in place -- a system that has for too long disadvantaged communities of color, our queer friends and family members, our immigrant and migrant communities, and many more.
This election, you have a choice -- do you want someone with a long and distinguished progressive record working for us every day in Congress, or do you want someone with a record of flip-flopping on these issues?
Do you want someone who knows this district, grew up in this district, cares deeply about this district, or someone who moved here because it was the next politically step up the ladder? Yes, we said it -- our opponent is shopping for a seat.
There's a lot at stake here -- and that's why Georgette should be your choice.
We have a steep end-of-month fundraising goal of $15,000 to raise by Friday night. Can you chip in $5 to help us smash this goal?
DONATE
Here at our campaign headquarters, we also have some choices to make within our campaign -- and most of them come down to money.
We ask ourselves things like:
* Do we have what it takes to raise enough from grassroots supporters this month, or do we need to pull Georgette from online campaign events and into call time?
* Do we run our new ad now, or do we wait until we get closer to the election, losing precious time talking to voters that will be voting early by mail more than ever before?
* Do we order a new batch of yard signs, or do we send out campaign flyers? (Hopefully both!)
These are choices we might have to make if we don't meet our goal.
Our campaign believes in a strong grassroots campaign that is built one person at a time. Our campaign is able to thrive thanks to you and your neighbors that chip in $5 here and $15 there. Georgette is so grateful for the support she's been receiving from grassroots supporters like you.
There are tough choices, and we hope you make the choice to help us meet our end-of-month goal. Can you chip in $5 or anything you can to help us get to $15,000 by Friday night?

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,The United States should not have secret police ,"#
Friend,
The United States should not have a secret police force.
Federal agents from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Marshals Service should not be stoking protests and unrest in cities across our country.
For weeks, Portland, OR, has seen demonstrations in favor of removing federal agents from their city. Donald Trump, instead of backing down from calls to remove these forces, is threatening to send agents to more places.
Let me be abundantly clear: I stand in solidarity with the thousands of you who have taken to the streets to demand that our government make meaningful progress in addressing the root causes of police brutality and systemic neglect of communities of color. And Trump needs to remove the federal agents from Portland immediately.
The murder of George Floyd has exposed a crumbling faith in government and mistrust of police that must be addressed immediately -- addressed with substantial, comprehensive reform of our criminal justice system, NOT by “sieging a city” with outside forces that local officials did not ask for.
Here in San Diego, I led the city council in taking swift action to fight discrimination by successfully banning police chokeholds and giving the voters a choice to establish an Independent Police Practices Commission to restore trust between communities and police.
Building trust between communities and law enforcement is just the beginning -- the public should have complete faith in police oversight -- we need to see more police oversight. We need to address the reality that many communities of color have been treated unfairly by police and have nowhere to turn to correct injustice.
The answer is certainly not by forcing secret police into cities -- that's why we're calling on Trump to remove these forces. Add your name to our petition telling Trump to put an end to mobs of secret police.
SIGN THE PETITION
Our broken criminal justice system is a civil rights issue. We need more community policing, more trust between neighborhoods and police, and real, meaningful, criminal justice reform. And as we’ve seen over the past few months, we won't stop until we achieve our plans.
Change will come from these mass mobilizations.
Change will come in numbers.
Let’s tell the Trump Administration to put an end to the mass mobs of secret police.
Sign the petition: Tell President Trump to put an end to mobs of secret police.
SIGN THE PETITION
My commitment to change is unwavering. I’m determined to continue doing the work to create a system that uplifts our communities of color, not a system where secret federal police.
The time is long overdue to create real dignity and respect for our communities.
Let’s keep up the good fight until justice is TRULY served.

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,National Coming Out Day ,"#
Friend,
Today, we celebrate National Coming Out Day!
I remember coming out to my own family and friends -- and the mixed emotions and reactions to telling loved ones how you identify can certainly feel overwhelming. And while folks around the world use this day to “come out” to the people closest to them, remember how strong you are, how beautiful you are, and how loved you are just the way you are!
Friend, the fight for LGBTQ+ rights is one of the many reasons why I'm working so hard to be your representative in Congress.
Just last week, SCOTUS Justices Alito and Thomas volunteered to eliminate same-sex marriage rights enshrined in the landmark Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges. And with the Amy Coney Barrett nomination advancing in the Senate, the threat to our hard-earned rights is only increasing.
We have got to do better.
From the FDA's ban on gay and bisexual men donating blood to Don't Ask Don't Tell and the trans-military ban, the United States has a stained history on rights for LGBTQ+ folks. In 2020, we must do better. We must do better -- to each other, for each other.
This fight is personal to me because I've experienced the discrimination firsthand, as have so many of you. In Congress and beyond, as the first LGBTQ+ Latina, I'll be a leader in the fight for full lived equality -- because in our democratic society, homophobia and discrimination have no place.
But I need your help to get there. Will you chip in $5 or more right now?
Whether you're an ally or a part of the LGBTQ+ community, let's make the 2020 National Coming Out Day one for the books. And in a time of heightened divisiveness, extend a hand of kindness and support, today and every day.

Friend --
There’s no doubt we’re facing many challenges.
The administration’s reckless handling of COVID-19. Institutional racism. An unemployment crisis. And a climate emergency threatening all life on our planet.
Despite how bad things look, I remain encouraged and hopeful about the future of our country. And I owe that to you.
We’ve faced difficulties here in San Diego, but I’m proud to have had your ongoing support for taking bold, progressive action on issues like climate change, immigration, and housing. It’s clear that our community is ready to lead in the fight for economic, racial, environmental, and social justice in Washington.
It gives me hope knowing that we have an opportunity to continue our work in Congress, and I look forward to what we can accomplish together.
This is the FINAL DAY to make a donation to my campaign before our end-of-quarter deadline. I need your help because we’re still short of our goal. Will you chip in $10, or whatever amount you can afford, to help us hit our mark?
Proud of the movement we’re building,

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,A blunt email about my race.,"#
Friend -- my opponent and the super PAC aligned with her campaign spent millions of dollars trying to defeat me in the March primary.
In addition, a nameless super PAC (likely the same one aligned with my opponent) spent hundreds of thousands on illegal and unmarked mailers promoting a Republican candidate in our race. It was a shrewd attempt to manipulate the vote count and box me out of the General Election.
We were outspent 4:1. But we outperformed expectations and made it to the General Election anyway. That's because supporters like you stood with us every step of the way:
Sunday marks our end-of-month fundraising deadline and we set a goal of generating 1,500 online donations to help us keep pace with our opponents’ spending. Can I count on you to contribute $3 today?
Donate $3
We're building an unprecedented coalition in CA-53.
Labor unions, environmental groups, the California Democratic Party, local elected leaders, even leading Democrats like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are unifying behind our campaign.
The truth is, we’re never going to compete in the money chase with our self-funding opponent and her super PAC. I still have a good feeling that our grassroots momentum can overcome her millions, but that’s impossible unless we must meet our own internal goals:
I’m asking personally. Will you make a $3 contribution to my campaign for Congress? Help me send a message that we're ready to overcome the odds and advance real progressive change in CA-53.

When hard working families are denied medical help because of exploding health care costs? I get fired up.
And when I see so many San Diegans who can’t afford housing in the city they call home? I get fired up.
I’m ready to take our fight to Washington. If you’re ready to join me, today is your last chance to make a contribution before votes are counted.
Please donate $3 or more today. We’ll put your donations right to work on our last-minute voter turnout efforts.

Folks,
I've been doing a lot of reflecting lately.
One of the thoughts I often ponder about is how it would feel to become the first LGBTQ+ Latina in Congress -- and that I just may get to know how it feels in a few days.
I may not have the inherited wealth or big money donations that my opponent benefits from -- but I have an unshakeable drive to protect and uplift this district.
That’s why I’m personally asking you to donate $5 or whatever you can towards our $75,000 end-of-month goal to help fund the campaign in these final days.

Representation is everything. Growing up, it would’ve been empowering beyond measure if I had seen people like me in positions of leadership. Now, I have the chance to be that role model for this generation and future generations.
That's what makes it all worth it. Because I'm here, against all odds. I'm an unconventional candidate, and people with backgrounds like mine rarely ascend to public office because we have to work twice as hard to get half as far.
But, here I am today. Here we are, 4 days from Election Day. And no matter what happens, I couldn't be prouder of the movement we've built.
This is bigger than me -- we’re creating history together. If we want bold, progressive change, we must stay energized until the very end.
That’s why I need you to chip in $5 or whatever you can spare before tomorrow night.

Team,
We've got some news to share, and it's not good. Our opponent's grandparents have funneled millions of dollars into a super PAC that solely exists to benefit her, and they just reserved $841,000 of TV ad time for October.
Let's make one thing clear: This is what it looks like when a billion-dollar family tries to buy a seat in Congress.
And we won't stand for it -- especially when we have a candidate who is SO right for the community. Georgette grew up here, went to school here, and has spent her entire career working to improve the district she knows and loves.

Alex O. via GeorgetteGomez.org,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,This month’s deadline is different. Here’s how: ,"#
Hey friend. Alex here -- Georgette's Deputy Campaign Manager.
We have a big fundraising deadline coming up on Sunday, so I wanted to give you a quick rundown on where things stand:
- Fundraising has ticked down after moving our in-person fundraising events online.
- So we set a goal of 1,500 online donations before Sunday to get back on track.
\- We've made good progress since Georgette reached out, but we’re still a bit short.
The good news is this month's goal is based on the number of people donating — not hitting a specific dollar amount. That’s because we need to send an important message about the strength of our grassroots movement in the face of our opponents' millions and super PAC support.
So with that, I must ask:
Will you please make a donation of $3 to our people-powered campaign? No matter how much you're able to give, know that it'll make a big difference.
We can do this,
Alex Obolensky
Deputy Campaign Manager
Donate $3

Team,
Once again, our opponent in this race is spreading the false claim that she has the endorsement of the California Democratic Party.
She doesn't. ONLY Georgette has their endorsement in this race.
This is not the first time she has made this claim -- and it's not the only lie she has spread during this campaign. She's embellished on her record, padded her resume, and stretched the definitions of truth.
If we can't trust our opponent to tell the truth about her endorsements, how can we expect her honesty if she gets elected?
Georgette Gómez doesn't need to lie: She lets her endorsements and her record speak for themselves. If you value honesty and trust in your representative to Congress, donate $5 or anything you can to help meet our end-of-month fundraising goal.

GeorgetteGómez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,I have you to thank ,"#
Friend,
I am so proud of you -- of your grit and determination in the face of a lawless and feckless administration and the worst public health crisis in a century.
This month, we've seen coronavirus surges across the country, all while Congress refuses to act swiftly in order to help the millions of people who are about to face evictions, foreclosures, or the loss of unemployment benefits.
But this didn't stop you from fighting.
We've seen unidentified federal police forces inciting violence within our communities as we continue to fight for racial equality.
But, even this didn't stop you from fighting.
As a people-powered, grassroots campaign, everything you've contributed to the campaign so far has directly impacted the progressive movement for change. And for that, I'm thanking you.
My opponent, however, cannot say the same.
While I have you, the people, to thank for our campaign's success, my opponent has her billionaire grandparents to thank, as they have funneled millions into a super PAC exclusively for her.
Across the entire country, this is the case. As one of the many progressives running against wealthy or corporate-backed candidates, you and I both know what's at stake this election.
As progressives, we fight. We stand up for what's right. We are constantly uplifting the voices of our marginalized communities, while we defend our earth by constantly addressing the climate crisis. We are no strangers to the fight for workers' rights -- and we are no strangers to promoting socio-economic equality on all fronts.
We are no strangers to the progressive coalition that will take Congress this November.
As we get closer to the election, I am here to thank you -- but also to remind you that we have work to do. As the people. For the people. We the people \-- not corporations -- will fight until November and beyond.
I am looking forward to another month of fighting for our progressive values alongside you, friend.
In solidarity,
Georgette Gómez

Date: Wednesday, September 23
Subject: People's movement
Hi friend,
Georgette here -- and I'm writing to let you know that we're facing our final, our biggest, and our most important fundraising deadline of the entire election cycle.
Our numbers will be published by the FEC for everyone to see. People are always going to talk -- especially when an unconventional candidate like myself is running head-to-head with a self-funder. So, let's give them something to talk about.
Chip in to this historical, grassroots campaign to help us meet our $50,000 goal by the 9/30 deadline.

Across California, mail-in ballots are going to be arriving in the coming weeks -- it's time to start casting your vote already!
Let's show the country what type of candidate is able to win in 2020. Growing up a low-income, first-gen Mexican American working multiple jobs to put food on the table -- people like me don't usually end up in politics.
But here I am. I'm here thanks to you.
Every retweet and Facebook share, every virtual town hall, every lawn sign, and every donation, no matter how big or small, has shown me that we can make history. I could be the first LGBTQ Latina in Congress -- thanks to you.
Together, we can show everyone that we can win this -- but I need your help. Rush in $5 or anything you can to this campaign so we can take our fight to Congress!
Thanks team, talk soon!

Friend --
In just a moment, I’m going to ask you to make a donation to Georgette Gómez’s campaign for Congress. But first, I hope you’ll let me explain why I’m asking, and your support is so important.
Working families across the country are being squeezed to their absolute breaking points. Young people are drowning in student debt. Parents are out of work and struggling to afford rent. Single moms are worried about paying for prescriptions or putting food on the table.
If it wasn’t clear before, this crisis has highlighted the need for big, structural change in this country. Right now, that means stemming the outbreak and ensuring economic relief in the short term. But in the long term, we need to restructure our economy to work for our working families -- not giant corporations and special interests.
Which brings me back to my friend Georgette:
As San Diego’s City Council President, Georgette has a proven track record on key issues like fighting to expand affordable housing and taking action on climate change. She’s spent her career in public service, and has shown great courage and foresight amidst this crisis. I know she’ll be an incredible ally in Congress.
I am proud to add my voice to the broad coalition supporting Georgette. Will you join me in supporting her campaign for Congress by chipping in $3 today?
If you've save your information with ActBlue Express, your contribution will be processed immediately.

Folks,
We're so close.
As I type this email, thousands of ballots are being returned in CA-53, and dedicated citizens across the country are standing in line to make their voices heard.
So far, more than 93 million votes have already been cast -- which is record turnout for this point in the election season. The message is clear: People are ready for change.
The citizens of CA-53, and our country as a whole, are ready for climate action, affordable health care for all, worker protections, and a pandemic response that adheres to the advice of public health officials.
We don't want to just “get back to normal” -- we want to be better than that. We want to create a new normal where every person -- regardless of gender, race, or sexual orientation -- is treated with the dignity they deserve.
That's what I'm here to do.
But the clock is ticking as we approach the eleventh hour. I am asking you personally, friend, will you donate $5 or whatever you can to help fund our final campaign efforts and win this race?

The constant election coverage can be overwhelming -- and you might even feel fatigued.
But we can't become indifferent. This moment requires a real sense of urgency and a commitment to staying engaged until the end.
Like you, I'm tired of the divisive rhetoric that dominates our current political climate. We need to elect leaders that will cut through the noise and work towards meaningful solutions to the issues that affect us every day.
As a community organizer and City Council president, my life has always centered around serving the people and fighting for justice. There is no greater honor, and I hope to continue that work as the first LGBTQ+ Latina in Congress.
I can't stress enough how much I need your support right now -- it's people like you that are the lifeblood of this campaign. Without grassroots contributions, we wouldn't be able to compete against a campaign self-funded by a millionaire like Sara Jacobs. Please, rush a donation of $5 and lead me to victory on November 3rd.
This is history in the making. I appreciate each and every one of you, always.
Let's do this thing,
Georgette

Team Gomez,teamgg@georgettegomez.org,Our teachers are modern day superheroes,"#
Great news, team: The National Education Association (NEA) just endorsed Georgette for Congress.
The NEA joins the California Federation of Teachers (CFT) and other labor organizations and educational groups in supporting Georgette -- they know that she will be a progressive champion fighting day-in and day-out for our students, faculty, and staff every day.
Far too often, our teachers are overworked, underpaid, and underappreciated for their work -- especially during these turbulent times in which they are supporting students remotely.
Not to mention the attacks they are facing from the president. Just a few weeks ago, Trump claimed that public school teachers are teaching children to hate their country. And now, he wants teachers to risk their lives by going back to school with no plan, equipment, or budget to ensure the safety of our teachers and their students.
Georgette will never let the president bully schools into reopening nor teachers into unsafe working conditions, and that's why we need her in Congress. Can you chip in $5 or anything you can to make sure we have a fighter for teachers and students in office?
Teachers deserve more than just recognition for their work: They deserve fair wages for their work. They deserve proper support from nurses, counselors, funding for school supplies and protective equipment to keep them safe, as well as proper benefits and health care.
We ask so much of our teachers, and it's time we gave them what they are due. That is exactly what Georgette is going to fight for in Congress, and that's why she's earned the support of the NEA, the CFT, and so many other organizations who also have the backs of educators.
Will you help Georgette make it to Washington to keep up the fight for teachers by donating $5 or more to her campaign?
DONATE
Thank you, friend.
Together, we will fight for our teachers and give them what they have long deserved.

Friend,
I hope you and your loved ones are safe.
From the coronavirus to high unemployment rates, we are all facing struggles during these times of uncertainty. What doesn't help is having a president who denies science and facts and spends more time getting angry on Twitter than working on solving our country's biggest problems.
If one thing is clear from what we have seen this year, it's that who you elect to represent you and their values matters more than ever.
Friend, that's why I want to hear directly from you -- what's on your mind during these challenging times?
As your representative, your needs will ALWAYS come first. That's why I am reaching out to find out how you and your family are doing during this time.
Will you take two minutes to fill out the campaign's issue survey to let us know how you're feeling?
TAKE THE SURVEY
When we elect representatives to Congress, we expect them to do just that -- represent constituents and their needs. I will always be the leader that represents you and only you.
Please add your thoughts to the survey -- I am willing to do whatever it takes to ensure I can be there for YOU.
Thank you for your participation. I look forward to hearing from you!

Friend,
Today is the start of Hispanic Heritage Month -- and a special time to be a part of Team Gómez, where we're working on a historical campaign to elect the first LGBTQ Latina to Congress!
But this campaign isn't just about making history -- it's about building a stronger future for everyone.
From the COVID-19 pandemic to our climate crisis to a nationwide movement to achieve justice, we need to meet the moment and elect leaders who will solve these problems with progressive policies. We need someone who has been in the trenches as an activist and an organizer for decades, fighting for environmental justice and battling against the Trump administration. And someone who has never forgotten her Barrio roots.
By electing Georgette, we are breaking down historical barriers, and we can keep that up when she's in Congress. We can't afford to wait for progressive policies -- we need Georgette in Congress now.
We've got a goal of raising $7,500 by tomorrow night in grassroots donations, and we're a little over halfway there. Can you chip in to help elect our progressive champion, Georgette?

There's no time to waste when it comes to health care reform -- over 700,000 Californians have been infected with the coronavirus. We must ensure every single person has access to affordable health care WITHOUT worrying about paying the bills.
There's no time to waste when it comes to climate change -- not with massive wildfires raging across our state causing incredible damage that can't be undone. We desperately need the Green New Deal to finally confront climate change with a solution that is scaled to meet the problem.
There is absolutely no time to waste on social, racial, and economic justice.
Our district represents a diverse community that looks out for one another. We wear masks to protect one another, buy local to support one another, and elect leaders who will support us through good times and bad. Leaders like Georgette.
Donate to Georgette by midnight tomorrow night to help us reach our fundraising goals. With your support now, we can elect the progressive champion we need to Congress.

There is an ugly two-headed monster ruling our country who is destroying our economy, invading our privacy, and eating away our rights...
This two-headed monster is of course the two-party system... the monster represents the erosion of our liberties, crony capitalism, and the dangerous powers of the state.
I am asking you to help me slay this beast in November.
Alex, I am preparing to deploy a voter contact and media blitz our movement has never seen before. For this reason, I am launching an end-of-month online fundraising goal of $500,000.

Thank you so much for joining our campaign.
It means so much to me knowing I have your support.
However, I must ask you for a personal favor... I hope you will sincerely consider this request and act quickly.
Here is the reality: We are quickly running out of time.
It is already August and we must do EVERYTHING in our power to spread our message of liberty and win the hearts and minds of Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and Libertarians who are sick of candidates like Trump and Biden.
I believe we can do it.

Alex, you may not realize it but we actually split test many of our emails to determine if it's more effective to ask for a single donation or a recurring gift.
We've done the math, and while we do raise more funds by asking for recurring donations, it will NO LONGER be effective mid next month.
Which is why it is so important you choose to act quickly.
You and I have a grand opportunity in 2020.

They fear her message of civil liberties, peace, and free markets. It’s a message they will not hear from Trump and Biden. It’s the message that truly makes our country great.
Now, the Democrats and Republicans are trying to use state laws and rules to prevent Jo from appearing on the ballot in all 50 states.
We cannot let this happen. We have to get Jo on all 50 states. Please rush your donation today to help Jo reach our important fundraising goal of $206,208 before June.

Jo Jorgensen for President
Alex,
I talk a lot about laws I want to repeal and bills that I would veto as President. However, there are three bills, already introduced in Congress, that I look forward to signing into law.
Here is why we need to work together to pass these bills:
I think Congress should not be able to cluster unrelated bills into one package.
I think Congress should have to read every word of every bill they pass.
I think there should be a waiting period before every congressional vote so that citizens can also have a chance to read the bills and comment.
I think every regulation bureaucrats write must be read, debated, and voted on by Congress. No more rule-making by unelected bureaucrats!
Restore the separation of powers! Only Congress can legislate!
I think courts should be prohibited from enforcing any rules or laws enacted in violation of these requirements.
That's why I favor these three bills created by a great organization called Agenda Setters...
* The One Subject at a Time Act
* The Read the Bills Act
* The Write the Laws Act
As I said, these bills have already been introduced in Congress!
How many libertarian organizations can you name that have good legislation introduced in Congress? Agenda Setters by Downsize DC has done it repeatedly, in both the House and Senate.
This is why I want you to sign-up with Agenda Setters by Downsize DC right now. But there's more...
Should you be able to sue cops who violate your rights? Agenda Setters is working to make this possible by supporting the Ending Qualified Immunity Act by Rep. Justin Amash.
Please sign-up with Agenda Setters right now! But beware...
If you skip doing this, or put it off, you'll miss learning about ""the 300"" and ""Option Activism."" These are powerful strategies that could change the political landscape. These ingenious ideas will allow you to set the agenda. But only if you JOIN!
I am supporting Agenda Setters' bills every day on the campaign trail. You can support me by supporting them. I look forward to hearing that thousands of you have done so.

Jo Jorgensen for President
Alex,
In 2008 and 2012, Dr. Ron Paul ran for President exposing the truth about the Federal Reserve to millions of Americans.
All the sudden, Republicans and Democrats started showing support for an ""Audit the Fed"" bill. This bill would require the Federal Reserve to be audited (something that has NEVER happened by an independent committee) and reveal where the TRILLIONS of dollars in bailout funds were distributed.
Wall Street insiders, big banks, international central banks, and governments across the globe would be exposed for ripping off the American people...
Naturally, Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell did everything in their power to stop it from passing.
I believe it is time we finally elect a President willing to Audit the Fed and put an end to the money-printing debt machine.
Alex, do you support auditing the Federal Reserve? Please sign my petition to Audit the Fed >>>
Let's show the establishment the American people support a full audit of the Federal Reserve and an end to crony capitalism.

Full Logo
Alex,
Over the past week I've been asked several questions from both Republicans and Democrats regarding where I stand on the issues.
Donald Trump and Joe Biden's records of policy failures, racism, and inappropriate behavior are making many traditional voters reconsider who they will cast their ballot for.
Allow me to briefly tell you what I am fighting for:
* Healthcare Freedom: We can reduce the cost of health care 75% by allowing real price competition, and by substantially reducing government and insurance company paperwork. This will make health care affordable for most Americans, while also reducing the cost of legacy programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA.
* Criminal Justice Reform: As President, I will use my Constitutional authority to end federal civil asset forfeiture prior to conviction, and pardon persons convicted of non-violent victimless crimes. I will also work with Congress to end the failed War on Drugs and other victimless crimes.
* Auditing the Federal Reserve: Our reckless monetary system threatens to destroy the value of the U.S. entirely and must be stopped. As President, I will audit the Federal Reserve and begin shutting down the money printing machine.
* Peace: I believe we should turn America into one giant Switzerland -- Armed and Neutral. It's time to bring our troops home and engage in free trade with our neighbors across the globe.
* Spending & Debt: As President, I will draw a line in the sand. NO MORE DEBT. I will use my authority to block any new borrowing and veto all new spending increases.
Alex, I believe 2020 has become a pivotal year for our movement.
The demand for criminal justice reform has never been greater... the two-party system has utterly failed to produce candidates worth voting for... and Americans are desperate for a leader with real solutions.
I hope you will consider joining our campaign. Please consider making an online contribution of $20.20, $35, $50, $100 or whatever you can afford by clicking here.

Alex,
The founding principles of our country are firmly rooted in liberty.
From the Declaration of Independence to the Constitution, there is no denying that the Libertarian Party and our campaign encompasses those principles.
However, I fear liberty is under attack.
You have Republicans and Democrats consistently chipping away at our freedoms. They both support the endless wars. They both support the Federal Reserve and corporatism. They both support reckless spending.
Let's declare our independence for the corrupt two-party system.

With less than a month to go until the election, voters are more tuned into campaigns.
This is a huge opportunity for Jo and our Libertarian movement!
Voters are now deciding who they are voting for and pulling the trigger. If we can increase our reach to voters, then this can be the biggest year yet for the Libertarian Party.
We broke down the numbers for you. Each $1 raised means we reach roughly 7-11 voters with our message of liberty, peace, and prosperity.
Now more than ever, your support is needed. Can you click here to donate $5, $20.20, $250, or any amount you can invest in voter outreach?

Donate $250 to Reach 1,750 Voters

Alex, your help today could mean we reach 70,000 voters this week if we raise $10,000 by tomorrow.
These voters will now get to hear Jo's message - bring the troops home, free market healthcare reform, criminal justice reform, defending the Constitution, and taking on the Federal Reserve.
You can help us build our movement into the future.

Alex,
I have exciting news to share with you.
Last night, we successfully met ALL of our fundraising goals before the FEC quarterly campaign finance deadline!
We set fundraising targets for email, social media, text, new first time donors, recurring donors... and I am thrilled to tell you we exceeded all of these goals.
I have been blown away with the support we have received. To date, our campaign has received contributions from over 20,000 individual donors, over 2,250 monthly contributors and an average contribution of $35.
I am also proud to share something with you I believe will leave you speechless...
I'm told our campaign will report over $635,000 cash on hand... this amount is greater than what Gary Johnson reported in 2016 on his first campaign finance report after winning the nomination.
This is a historic moment for our campaign, the Libertarian Party, and the liberty movement altogether.
While we take a moment to celebrate this victory, we still have a fight in front of us...
The corrupt, two-party system and their mega-donors are doing everything they can to keep us off the ballot and silence our campaign with the help of the main stream media.
Our goals will become bigger. We simply cannot keep up with their fundraising otherwise.
But, Alex, our campaign has worked hard to keep our overhead as low as possible so we can make sure your hard earned money goes to fighting for ballot access and spreading our message of free people and free markets.
In the meantime, I will work tirelessly to make sure our campaign is doing everything we can to get on the debate stage and make sure YOUR VOICE is heard.
You showed last night we are a force to be reckoned with and I am beyond proud to have your support.

These are also great tools to get people out for local campaign events. The number of voters we reach depends on the number of volunteer texters and callers we have. Here’s where to sign up to join our texting/calling team:

Alex,
Wow.
Did you see Jo's email this morning?
I am beyond thrilled to see Jo polling above Gary Johnson's 2016 numbers. We have the chance to FINALLY break 5% of the popular vote and begin tearing down the two-party system.
Jo asked me to resend you this email and include a personal donation link you can use:
[[URL REDACTED]][[EMAIL_REDACTED]]
I encourage you to read Jo's full message below. However, here is a quick summary:
\- Our overall goal is to raise $350,000 to fund all voter outreach efforts to turn our supporters and earn 5% of the popular vote
\- We must hit $50,000 TODAY to start with a bang.
\- Facebook is banning campaigns from placing ads after October 26th... this means we must FULLY fund our Facebook budget beforehand.
Here is your donation link again. Please consider chipping in $100, $50, $20.20, $10, or even $5.

Jo Jorgensen for President
Read Jo Jorgensen's official campaign message & announcement below:
Alex, you and I have a grand opportunity in 2020 no one is talking about...
Recent polls in Alaska and Virginia show I am polling over Gary Johnson's numbers in 2016. Even better, Libertarian candidates in Arkansas and Indiana are polling high in their races which will help fuel voter turnout for our campaign as well.
We have a real opportunity of securing more than 5% of the popular vote this year.
What does this mean? Any party that secures more than 5% of the popular vote is eligible for public funding and would make ballot access FAR easier in several states.
This would be a BIG step towards defeating the two-party system for good.
Alex, this is a major call-to-action. I have instructed all volunteers and campaign staff to do EVERYTHING in our power to achieve this 5% threshold.
But I need your help. I am launching our GOTV (Get-Out-The-Vote) fundraising goal of $350,000 and am asking you to consider making the biggest donation you can today.
Stand with Jo: Donate $20.20
Stand with Jo: Donate $50
Stand with Jo: Donate $100
Stand with Jo: Donate $250
Stand with Jo: Donate $500
Stand with Jo: Donate $1,000
Stand with Jo: Donate any amount!
We have a big problem though...
We must immediately raise $50,000 today or we could be in big trouble. Facebook is preventing all campaigns from placing ads after October 26th. Which means, I must raise funds quickly in order to fund our voter outreach efforts on this platform.
Let's start with a bang.
I am setting our goal to raise $50,000 by the end of the day to ensure we continue reaching voters as they are deciding to vote.
Alex, I'm counting on your help to make this possible.
Help me spread our message of free markets, a peaceful foreign policy, criminal justice reform, putting an end to the failed War on Drugs, and defending the Constitution.
Winning hearts and minds with the message of liberty is not a battle that will be won in a single election. However, I KNOW we can move the needle and make the Founding Fathers proud of us.

Steve Dasbach - Jorgensen for President,steve_dasbach@jo20.com,Breaking: New polling for Jo is going to change everything,"We've got big poll numbers and competitive races. Get ready for exciting news...
Jo Jorgensen for President
Alex --
We've got big poll numbers and competitive races. Get ready for exciting news...
Jo Jorgensen is polling at 8% in Alaska (Oct 16 Sierra College/NY Times poll)!
That's way higher than what Gary Johnson received four years ago!
But it gets better...
Jo Jorgensen is also polling 8% among people who have ALREADY VOTED in Virginia!
And 4% among those who are still planning to vote! (Oct 15 Roanoak College poll)!
Both numbers are far higher than in 2016!
And good things are happening in down-ballot races too.
* Libertarian Donald Rainwater is competitive in the Indiana governor's race. He even has a chance to win!
That's right! A Libertarian is competitive in a race for GOVERNOR!
Rainwater also has more cash on hand than the Democratic challenger and he's running radio and TV ads, unlike the Democrat! Meanwhile...
* In Arkansas, Libertarian Ricky Harrington is the sole opponent for Senator Tom Cotton, whose support has fallen below 50%! Get this...
Harrington is only 11 percentage points behind Sen. Cotton, with 13% undecided! But it gets better...
Cotton dodged a scheduled TV debate with Harrington, so Harrington got the stage and the TV screen all to himself for an entire hour!
Reporters asked him questions and he did an amazing job answering them! The coverage was phenomenal!
I’ve been active in the Libertarian Party for forty years, and this is the first time we've had competitive candidates for Governor and the U.S. Senate! Things are definitely moving our way!
But the national media still refuses to admit there's anyone in the presidential race but Trump and Biden. So millions of voters still think Trump and Biden are their only choices!
We only have two weeks left to reach these voters!
And given the pace of early voting, we must reach them now – before they cast an uninformed vote for a candidate they despise. And there's good news on that front too...
We have volunteers texting hundreds of thousands of independent voters!
And we have many more volunteers reaching voters in their community!
But advertising is still our best way to reach the tens of millions of voters who dislike having to choose between Trump and Biden.
You’ve probably heard how social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are restricting political activity and blocking people who present alternative viewpoints. This has happened to several Jorgensen staffers and volunteers! We've been able to beat back these challenges, but other obstacles must still be hurdled.
PLEASE REALIZE>>> All ads on Facebook must be placed and running by October 26th. There will be no ads placed after that! Seize this moment or lose it!
And TV advertising must be paid for in advance! We need your donation now to book our Facebook ads before the deadline, and to buy our TV ads NOW!
We can achieve record results! We can send a message that more people want things to move in a libertarian direction. And we can secure ballot status in more states than ever before!
This is a people's campaign, fueled by individual donors like you. You are the power behind this movement and the great results we're getting. Please help us realize all the remaining potential!

Jo asked me to send you an email this morning, Alex.
I'm crossing my fingers you receive this, open it, and consider our message because so much is on the line.
Your name is on the list of supporters I am reaching out to asking for help before the midnight FEC deadline. You see, the FEC has a ""Pre-General"" campaign finance filing and we must show strong numbers on this report.
If we fail to do so, the mainstream media could entirely black out our message...
It is ESSENTIAL Jo's voice is heard in the following days.
Do you remember what happened during/after the last debate?
Google search queries for Jo Jorgensen's name skyrocketed! As did our website traffic. The more people listen to Donald Trump and Joe Biden, the more they bleed support.
Jo is picking up those voters.
It's our job to reach those voters to win them over with our message of liberty!
Alex, can you help me reach these voters by funding our persuasion and GOTV (get out the vote) efforts? You can click here or use one of the buttons below to make a donation of $20.20, $50, $100, $250, or even more:

Stand with Jo: Donate $100
Stand with Jo: Donate $250
Stand with Jo: Donate $500
Stand with Jo: Donate $1,000
Stand with Jo: Donate any amount!
Our country needs Jo's voice now more than ever.
Four more years of Donald Trump or handing the reins over to Biden will not advance the cause of freedom. Neither of these men support a peaceful foreign policy, gun rights, civil liberties, or revolutionizing our healthcare system via the free market.
Jo's message is popular when voters have an opportunity to hear it.
You can be the DIRECT reason why Jo wins new voters to our side.
Please consider making the most generous donation you can before our midnight deadline, Alex.
Thank you,

P.S. The goal is to raise $50,000 before midnight. Jo is counting on your help and asked me to email you this morning. Please consider donating ANY amount today.

Alex,
This weekend Jo and I completed a deep dive into the campaign's fundraising numbers to determine where to allocate resources. Do you want to know something shocking we learned about our fundraising numbers?
If the 100,000+ supporters we have 0n our email list, that have not donated to our campaign yet, would contribute $32.80 (the average size donation) we would EASILY beat our goal, raise over $3,280,00, and be able to TRIPLE our advertising budget.
This means reaching millions of voters with Jo's message of free markets, reducing the costs of healthcare, civil liberties, criminal justice reform, and bringing the troops home.
Alex, I can see from our records you have not donated to Jo Jorgensen's campaign yet.
Jo is counting on your help.
She asked me to write this email and reach out to you as soon as possible. Alex, you have indicated you support for Jo for President and she is counting on your help to make this all possible.

Jo Jorgensen 2020
Do you want to know what I've learned about Jo during this campaign?
Jo is deeply concerned about the future of our country and creating solutions to help people's livelihoods, health, and happiness.
It goes beyond simply believing in the ideas of liberty.
It goes beyond having read books on free markets, the Constitution, growing the Libertarian Party, or election results.
Jo wishes to spread the message of liberty because our ideas have the ability to lift people out of poverty, unleash innovation, reduce the cost of healthcare, and free people from our draconian criminal justice system.
Jo is running because she wishes to help people.
I admire her for everything she's done on the campaign trail. Not many people will ever fully realize this but... running for President isn't easy.
Jo is a tireless worker and one of the greatest messengers of the ideas of liberty I have ever seen.
Alex, recent polling has indicated Jo has the opportunity to earn the biggest vote total a Libertarian presidential candidate has ever received.
If Jo earns 5% or more of the popular vote, it means ballot access for future Libertarian candidates will be made FAR EASIER and we can focus more of our resources on spreading our message.
Please help Jo reach more voters with our message by using one of these links below to donate:
Stand with Jo: Donate $20.20
Stand with Jo: Donate $50
Stand with Jo: Donate $100
Stand with Jo: Donate $250
Stand with Jo: Donate $500

Stand with Jo: Donate any amount!
We have our mission.
You and I have a chance to earn the highest vote total a Libertarian candidate has ever received.
What we do over the following weeks will impact the liberty movement and future campaigns against the two-party system for the next decade.
Jo and I are counting on your help.
Thank you, Alex.

Alex,
Sorry for the late night email. There's too much on my mind and a lot riding on this election.
I am overwhelmed by the progress we have made so far.
However, I am anxious about this upcoming fundraising goal and the July 31st deadline. My team gave me an update - $162,000 left to raise and only three more days to go.
Every election, politicians promise change. But who really benefits from those changes?
They do. Politicians – their friends – special interests – they reap the benefits.
Not you.
Let’s try something different this election. Let’s take money and power away from politicians, and return control to you, your family, and your community.
* Reduce the cost of healthcare by 75%
* Grow our economy, creating more jobs
* Eliminate injustice and bring peace to our cities
* End involvement in foreign wars & bring our troops home
* Reduce the cost of education
* Safeguard future generations by ending deficit spending
* Keep more of what you earn
Real Change – for Real People.
But I can't do it without you.
Please click here to donate tonight or tomorrow at your earliest chance.
Thank you so much, Alex. I'm glad to have you on our team.

Jo Jorgensen 2020
Good morning Alex,
Did you watch the debate last night?
Donald Trump and Joe Biden refused to answer any of the hard hitting questions and proved, beyond a shadow of a doubt, neither of them are fit to serve in the White House.
It's no wonder they were so desperate to keep Jo off the debate stage, she would have wiped the floor with them.
The sad reality is Trump and Biden actually agree on many issues:
\- Endless wars overseas
\- The War on Drugs
\- The erosion of our 4th Amendment rights & privacy
\- Unlimited bailouts
\- Supporting the Federal Reserve's money printing machine
Jo is now experiencing a post debate SURGE in website traffic and new supporters. The American people are waking up!
Alex, Jo is fighting back and bringing voters a real choice. But Jo is counting on your immediate support today. Can you donate $5, $20.20, $50, or even $100 before midnight?
Tonight marks the deadline for the important FEC deadline. Jo is looking to raise $300,000 today. We have less than $31,200 left to go!
Why does it matter?
The FEC deadline will be reported publicly. Biden and Trump's teams will be watching the results closely - so will the media. We need to have a strong showing of support.
Now is the time to increase your support for Jo as we approach the final stretch of the campaign.
Jo is watching the results carefully today. I will be updating her personally. Please use one of the embedded links below to give.

I'm getting worried about reaching this goal by Monday.
We are still short $176,900. Please follow up with everyone today and see if they can respond.
Please provide me with the updated list of donors tomorrow as well. I like to keep track of who donates, see any new names, and remember those that have given more than once.

Hi Alex,
Tonight is Jo's final day to reach $500k before midnight.
As a special ""thank you"", Jo will be reading out the names of donors who give today on a Facebook livestream. Jo only has $53k left to raise!
Before the livestream begins, I will provide her with a full list of donors to thank on the livestream.
The Facebook live will begin at 7:00 p.m. ET. I hope she will get to read your name, Alex!
Please rush your support today by clicking here and donate $20.20, $50, $100, $250, or any amount you can afford >>
Why is this goal so important?
As you may know, Jo is fighting against a two headed monster - the Democrat and Republican establishments. They are doing everything in their power to silence our movement and keep her out of the media and off the ballots.
The campaign has put together a strategy for both ballot access and getting her name out there to voters with new ads.
All of this requires immense resources.
I am personally hoping we cross our $500,000 goal and bump it to $600,000 today! I know how happy that would make Jo.
She is counting on your help today, Alex.
Can you donate today and get your first name and last initial read out loud during Facebook live? Select an amount below.

Steve Dasbach - Jorgensen for President,steve_dasbach@jo20.com,Alex? Checking back here.,"Jo asked for an update and I wanted to reach out to you first.
Jo20-Logo
Alex,
Democrats and Republicans are colluding to keep Jo out of the debates. They control the Commission on Presidential Debates. Yet, Jo is a fighter. She's not giving up. Jo has a plan to get into the debate.
Did you see Jo's last email? If not, then I highly recommend you go read it and respond as soon as you can.
Jo is planning to raise $1 million before the Presidential Debates. This is our most ambitious goal yet!
Alex, our movement and campaign relies on hardworking supporters online. We do not have the establishment on our side like Trump and Biden. Can you click here and donate $20.20, $50, $100, or any amount you can generously afford?
As Jo mentioned before, ALL donations online will get your first name and last initial added on the side of my tour bus as a special thank you!
I have to give Jo an update tonight. I wanted to check in with you before update Jo. Please respond before then and reserve your name spot on the tour bus.
Please send an urgent donation to help get Jo in the debate >>
We have exceeded all our expectations so far, despite the current economy being shut down and COVID-19 preventing normal campaign operations. In fact, we had to cancel several major fundraising events due to COVID-19. That is why it is critical for you to donate online.
I have embedded several links for you to give online. Please do not hesitate. Select an amount below to donate.
Donate $5
Donate $10
Donate $20.20

Donate $100

Donate $1,000
Donate Any Amount
We are all worried about the future of our country. If we've learned anything in 2020, it is that we cannot rely on the Democrats and Republicans to get us out of a crisis.
There is a clear lack of leadership in our country. And Jo is the candidate who can unite our nation behind commonsense principles of liberty.
I'll be sure to tell Jo of your support tonight.
Thank you,
Steve Dasbach
Campaign Manager
P.S. All online donations will get your first name and last initial honored on the tour bus. I am hoping to raise $1 Million to get into the debates. Please click here to donate now >>

Alex, I sincerely hope this reaches you in time or I may be in trouble.
I am working through the weekend and my campaign manager gave me an update that I want to share with you.
Please respond before Monday with a generous contribution of $5, $20.20, $50, or any amount you can spare >>
We're looking to raise $20,000 by Monday in order to reach up to 140,000 new voters with our message of liberty. However, our campaign is falling short. There's still $4,000 to go.
Why does this matter?
I've instructed all campaign staff to scale voter outreach efforts.
We are witnessing a tremendous surge of support since the debate because voters realized how awful Trump and Biden both really are. They want someone who resonates with them - not an out of touch celebrity and career politician.
Your support has a greater impact than ever before:
As my campaign prepares for the final two weeks, your support will become even more important. Undecided and swing voters are weighing their options and we MUST reach them during this critical juncture.
Not only are we winning new support, we are building a Libertarian movement together.
And I believe we are the future.
I do not have the corporate media, the billionaires, nor the military industrial complex backing my campaign. I rely on hardworking Americans who believe in liberty.
Please, Alex, help me reach more voters in the final two weeks by click here to donate or the button below >>

Jo20-Logo
Alex,
I want your input before I present the latest numbers to Jo tonight. Can you please read through and respond with your support?
Here's where we stand.
Our campaign has raised $80,942.16 since Monday.
That leaves us with $169,057.84 left to raise by midnight on August 31st.
There's no other way to put it, Alex, but if we don't raise $42,264.46 a day then we will fail to reach this critical goal.
Can you click here to donate $5, $20.20, $50, or more?
Your financial support will mean our movement will reach another 2,750,000 voters in September. With the corporate media and their cronies trying to silence Jo, your support becomes even more important to our plan of reaching millions of voters by election day.
It comes out to be roughly 11 voters per dollar (factoring in our reach on social media, streaming ads, and the bus tour).
Imagine reaching an additional 2.75 million voters with our message...
* Jo exposing Donald Trump and Joe Biden's support for the War on Drugs.
* Teaching Americans how we can reduce healthcare costs over 75% by unleashing the free market.
* Enacting REAL criminal justice reform - We must put an END to injustices happening in cities like Minneapolis, Kenosha, Chicago, Baltimore, and across the country.
* Finally bringing our troops home.
* And giving voters a REAL choice in November.
Our message is powerful and resonates with voters. But none of it will be possible without your immediate support.
Select an amount below to rush your support today.

Alex,
As you may have already heard, Jo's mother passed away on Wednesday. Please keep Jo, her family, and her friends in your thoughts and prayers over the coming days as she grieves this unexpected loss.
Naturally, Jo is taking some time off of the campaign trail to be with her friends and family members.
However, she instructed me to ensure the trains keep running on time, we continue reaching voters, and the campaign does NOT stop. I admire her grit and her desire to spread the message of liberty even in difficult times.
She also asked me to inform you she will return shortly and will not allow anything to stop her from serving as the voice of liberty in the 2020 election.
If you would like, please reply to this email with any words of encouragement you would like me to share with her.

Alex,
Do you know why I decided to run for President of the United States?
I am not seeking to wield some kind of almighty power, rule people's lives, or simply beat Team Red or Team Blue...
Voters need a real choice.
In 2016, the American people were forced to choose between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Millions were frustrated and chose to vote who they viewed as the lesser of two evils.
Now?
Well, the two-party system has yet again chosen to nominate two disastrous candidates for the most powerful position in the world.
My desire is to provide the American people with a viable third choice this election. I am not offering bailouts to big banks, massive contracts to members of the military industrial complex, favors to lobbyists, or selling access...
What is my offer?
Liberty.
I wish to be elected President of the United States and do the following:
* Order our troops home the moment I enter the Oval office.
* Pardon all non-violent and victimless crimes.
* Unleash the free market and allow capitalism to revive our economy and reduce the cost of healthcare.
* Authorize a FULL audit of the Federal Reserve and put an end to the money printing machine.
* Demand Congress send me legislation to enact TRUE criminal justice reform.
* Begin rolling back the unconstitutional spying apparatus the NSA, Homeland Security, and CIA have built to creep on everyday Americans.
Alex, today is the very last day of my August online fundraising goal. I have roughly $120,000 left to raise today.
I am really counting on your help, Alex.
There's no way I can do this without your help.
You and I have a powerful opportunity to spread the message of liberty in 2020, defeat the two-party system, and change the direction of our country.
You can click here to donate ANY amount. A gift of $20.20, $50, $100, $250, $500, or even more makes a big difference.
Once you complete your donation, reply back, ""Done!"" and I will do my best to thank you throughout the day (I receive over 1,000 messages a day so please forgive me if it takes a little time!).
Thank you so much, Alex.
Please act ASAP.

## Liberty or Treat!
by Jennifer Imhoff
Some have made the claim that Halloween is an example of socialism, where the many arrive at the doors of the few demanding favor. However I'd argue that Halloween is the exact opposite and instead a great opportunity for children to participate in a free market.
9vWp6ZiszZSjfYNzQ3RYf37FYVvZfSmvCpb2r4DUx1ohhk2GFzwxLRewb3cUN5pjDWzZw4jJuaU66vjxGACrCXQ6pajX5AVjb69TJPvddKfzYBmngvnnTSJRPFEqcjF25Dc3qDYfc63A4RsSe
Halloween is one of those holidays that can be enjoyed by any child - regardless of social class. With some hard work and ingenuity a box, a sheet, or any combination of mundane household items can be turned into a clever costume that can be rewarded with one form of payment agreed upon by children around the world; candy. For one night, candy becomes a universal currency paid out to those who showed up and were willing to put in the work of production and marketing.
Halloween brings out a healthy competition among children and allows them to experience both product design and marketing. Maybe your costume is not as clever as the other kids in school but you are willing to knock on more doors. Maybe a child is clever enough to target just the homes that give the king size bars or they figured out that people give more candy to emptier looking bags, hiding their haul from view. Whichever tactic is used there is a lesson gained and with each year they participate in an opportunity to engage in those self taught lessons.
Some will choose the costume they want, forgoing the candy for self satisfaction - some will choose the costume that pleases their peers, forging candy for social status, others will choose a costume that appeals to the parents, targeting the candy giver. There is a whole childhood of opportunity to try each one
Unfortunately this year, many children will be denied the opportunity of learning economics this year; but there is still an opportunity for you to have a little fun with decorations!
You are cordially invited...
Join us as we celebrate the end of the campaign and all that we have accomplished this cycle. The venue will be at the Tower Club, in Dallas, TX.

The election night party begins at 8:00 pm at the Tower Club, in Dallas, TX with hors d'oeuvres throughout the evening and a cash var. Dallas Cowboys' official DJ, DJSC (a fellow Libertarian) will spin the vinyls for us throughout the evening as we watch the election results!

How to Talk to Christian Voters: Liberty And Care For The Poor
By Nick McRae
This probably goes without saying, but Libertarians have a bit of a PR problem when it comes to Christian voters, despite the fact that many Libertarians—including high profile liberty-lovers like Ron Paul—are themselves outspoken Christians. Indeed, Libertarian values are often misunderstood by Christians in general, who may think libertarianism encourages personal immorality and discourages care for the poor and marginalized. As a pastor in Texas, I run up against these two misunderstandings all the time.
If we Libertarians are going to reach more Christian voters with Jo Jorgensen’s message of freedom, we need to learn to talk about our values in a way that the average Christian will understand and connect with. I don’t have space in this Jorgensen Insider article to discuss both personal morality and care for the poor, so at this time I’ll simply tackle the latter. Below are some thoughts that I hope will help you frame your discussion about liberty with any Christian voters who may come across your path.
Whether they realize it or not (and Republican-leaning Christians in particular may not), many Christians support big government out of well-meaning concern for the poor and marginalized. It’s natural for Christians to care about the least, the last, and the lost; it’s built right into the religion. Some will assume that because Libertarians oppose taxation for government programs, Libertarians must not care what happens to the poor and marginalized.
It’s important to assure Christian voters that this isn’t the case. Libertarians do care for the poor. We simply believe that local communities made up of caring individuals know better how to care for their real, flesh-and-blood neighbors than do politicians and bureaucrats in Washington, DC.
Republicans and Democrats want to convince you that the best way to care for your neighbors is to take your tax money to Washington, come up with a one-size-fits-all plan for 330 million people, and then enforce their plan on every American everywhere, whether it actually makes sense for your neighbors or not.
They propose to do this without ever setting foot in your neighborhood. They expect to do it without ever looking the poor and marginalized people of your neighborhood in the eye and asking them what they actually need. Libertarians believe that you and your neighbor know better how to serve one another than do politicians and bureaucrats in Washington.
The even bigger problem with tax-funded, one-size-fits-all, big-government programs intended to remedy poverty and oppression is that these programs convince people like you and me that we’re off the hook for taking care of our own neighbors. Sending off our tax dollars to the government too often makes us Americans—Christians and non-Christians alike—feel like we’ve fulfilled some moral obligation toward the poor without really having to do anything.
You’re busy people, these government programs tell us. Let us figure out how to help the poor. No need for you to actually meet your neighbors. No need for you to look them in the eye and ask them how you can help. No need for you to decide for yourself when to open up your wallet to help with the groceries, or the rent, or to help buy a suit for a job interview. Let us handle it for you. We know better than you.
Jesus said, “Love your neighbor as yourself.” He didn’t say, “Pay the government and let them love your neighbor for you.” Invite Christian voters to imagine how much of a difference they could make in their actual neighbors’ lives with the money they normally have to send off to Washington.
A vote for Libertarian Jo Jorgensen is a vote for an America where Americans are free to love our neighbors ourselves. We don’t need Washington to do that for us.

## Why You Should Vote for Dr. Jo Jorgensen, Libertarian Party Candidate for President.
By Les Deffner, State Director, Illinois for Jorgensen-Cohen Campaign
The Libertarian Party (LP) speaks both languages of the liberal left, and the conservative right. We have the best elements of both, and as such we have the greatest position to help bridge the gap between the camps pushing the culture wars to its boiling point. The LP is uniquely qualified to help heal our nation politically and bring back balance and sanity. I am grateful the LP chose Dr. Jorgensen to represent us as our POTUS nominee.
People tell me “I am honestly not a fan of Trump or Biden; I mean is this really the best this country has as a representation of our potential leadership and the face of the people right now? These two are the best?! It makes me sad and disappointed."" This problem is a direct result of all the people who have said ""I would vote for the better third party candidate, but they have no chance of winning, so I'm going to vote for the lesser of two evils because they 'at least have a chance'.” People kick the can down the road out of fear-based voting, and then wonder why things keep getting worse. They ought to stop and consider how they have contributed to this national problem of our national political culture wars and be painfully honest with themselves.
I believe this country is, and always has been greater than the best (and greater than the worst) political candidates. We will survive the 2020 election, but the slide to furthering bitter acrimony and resentments pulling Americans apart, will continue. Neither Trump nor Biden can stop that. A vote for Dr. Jorgensen allows people to save face, retreat to their corners in a form of political time-out, and to cool off.
Around 138 million Americans voted in the 2016 presidential election. However, those 138M only make up 58.1% of our voting-eligible population. In 2016, nearly 42% of adults eligible to vote chose not to do so. People do have another choice. If all who are upset at Trump or Biden , or who had chosen to stay home and not-vote in 2016 (and are considering doing the same again in 2020) would vote for Jo Jorgensen, she would win. People need to shake off the fear and apathy that has gripped them and to vote with real courage. Real courage is needed when faced with what seems an impossible task. Just ask any combat soldier.
Dr. Jo Jorgensen understands that the contest is not about Democrats vs. Republicans. The real fight is between those who support an overbearing government that is filled with fraud, waste, abuse, corruption, and cronyism, and those who choose true liberty, returning the power back to The People: Libertarian candidates.
To restore the political balance and improve the discourse in America is with our votes, and Jorgensen will be on the ballot in all 50 states. The Federal Election Commission considers just 5% of the vote to be significant for their purposes, and most states offer things like ballot access at that 5% mark. This is also part of why we run Presidential Candidates: to improve the chances of our down-ballot candidates. When the LP spends 80 to 90% of our time, money, and effort just to get on the ballot, time to raise money and campaign, or win, becomes extremely hampered. This is by design. This is deliberate disenfranchisement done by the Democrats and Republicans via Ballot Access laws.
Democrats and Republicans have made it clear that their number one priority is to obtain or retain control so they can pass laws to tell other people how to live. Since 1971, the LP has been the most consistent in its platform. Dr. Jorgensen has been part of that effort for 40 years.
It may be cliché, but it is true: my road to libertarianism began around 2005 when I began reading Lockean philosophy. John Locke’s writing was the foundation of Thomas Jefferson’s understanding of government leading to writing the Declaration of Independence and his initial drafts of the Constitution. Additional reading of economists F. A. Hayek and Murray Rothbard, Ayn Rand, and the reasonings of Congressman Ron Paul accelerated my understanding.
As a Navy veteran, it pains me to see my military brothers and sisters returning from Endless Wars, and from unjust deployments that do nothing to keep America safe. I did not serve my country only to return and allow politicians to continue to erode at American’s rights to pursue their life, liberty, and happiness. My vote is with Dr. Jo Jorgensen.
Les Deffner is currently serving the cause for Liberty as: State Director, Illinois for Jorgensen-Cohen Campaign; Campaigns Coordinator, Libertarian Party of Illinois; Chairman, Lake County Libertarian Party; State Central Committee Rep, IL 10th District, and Precinct Committeeman.

Donald Trump: Trump is counting on fiscal conservatives to fall in line and vote Republican on election day. The reality is, Trump has nearly matched Obama's entire 8 year spending record in 4 years.
Conservatives concerned with the national debt, spending, and deficit are NOT happy with the President.

As you can see, we are not receiving donations from big crony capitalists, friends of the Federal Reserve, lobbyists, or insiders.
No, our campaign is funded by hardworking people in all different jobs, career fields, and industries.
It's difficult to convey over email, but I wish you knew how grateful I am for everyone's support. It's impossible for me to thank the THOUSANDS of people that have stepped up to fight for liberty.
It really does mean a lot to me and I know how hard these supporters are working, trying to feed their families, put gas in the car, and pay bills.
Alex, this campaign (our campaign) is fueled by supporters like you chipping in $20.20, $50, or $100 at a time.
I am counting on your help to reach our $300,000 end-of-quarter FEC campaign finance goal.

Why is this FEC goal so important?
* These funds are being used to contact voters over the phone, online, via text, and through paid TV and streaming ads. Your donation helps us spread our message!
* The media is monitoring how much money we raise... if we fail to reach our goal it could embarrass the campaign.
* This is our big chance to recruit millions of new voters to the side of liberty in 2020.
Let's show Donald Trump and Joe Biden the American people are tired of their failures and want a REAL solution.

Imagine Jo Jorgensen on the debate stage with Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
Imagine Jo speaking truth to power in front of millions of viewers.
Imagine Jo calling out the corruption to Trump and Biden's face.
Imagine Jo demanding our troops come home from overseas.
Imagine Jo making the case for ending the war on drugs, ending corporate socialism, and bringing freedom back to our country.
Help get Jo in the debates, Alex. Can you send an urgent donation of $5, $20.20, $50, $100 or any other amount? Click here to donate >>
The reality is Democrats and Republicans are desperately trying to keep Jo out of the debates.
Trump is an insufferable narcissist and Biden and complete full sentences! It goes to show you just how corrupt the system has become that both Trump and Biden are propped up by a cabal of special interests.
There's only one real, hardworking American running for President - that's Jo. That's why they do not want her in the debate.
Imagine Biden failing to answer for his record on the drug war and our failed foreign policy... Imagine Donald Trump being exposed for the big government spender he truly is. Jo could NOT lose that debate!
We don't need the gatekeepers. Jo can go directly to voters to get into the debate. But it will require a lot of resources.
Jo is looking to raise $1 million before the Debates. It's her most ambitious goal yet.

Jo Jorgensen,jo_jorgensen@jo20.com,the ATF is corrupt,"Alex, the ATF recently made sweeping changes to the gun laws.
Jo Jorgensen 2020
Alex,
Your rights are under assault. Republicans and Democrats are doing nothing about it. This is an urgent update on the ATF's most recent assault on the Second Amendment.
""Long barreled pistols"" are now banned.
This includes everything from long barreled AR pistols to revolvers. There's no telling how this will be enforced and it opens the door to more gun control.
Make no mistake: This administrative rule change will be backed with the full power of the government. Armed men will confiscate your Second Amendment rights.
This sweeping legal change did NOT pass Congress.
Unelected bureaucrats simply changed administrative rules. This is COMPLETELY unconstitutional.
I am the only candidate serious about defending your rights, Alex. Can you please help us make a bigger impact on this election by donating $20.20, $50, or more today?
Donate $20.20

Donald Trump will not protect your 2nd Amendment rights. Joe Biden will also slowly squeeze your rights away. We need someone who is serious about this important issue.
I would abolish the unconstitutional government agency, and toss them into the ash heap of history. That's how committed I am to your right to bear arms.
If you support freedom and the Bill of Rights, then I hope I can have your immediate support today. The election is around the corner.

Jo Jorgensen,jo_jorgensen@jo20.com,The WORST President in history...,"It's not Donald Trump. It's not Barack Obama. Neither of them even come close. In fact, it's not any modern President.
Jo Jorgensen 2020
Alex,
I am sometimes asked ""who is the worst President in the history of the United States?""
It's not Donald Trump. It's not Barack Obama. Neither of them even come close. In fact, it's not any modern President.
No, the worst President in the history of the United States is Woodrow Wilson.
Woodrow Wilson is responsible for two great financial evils: the 16th Amendment establishing the Federal Income Tax and the Federal Reserve Act.
These two pieces of legislation, both passed or were ratified in 1913 under Woodrow Wilson, set in motion the ability for the Federal government to spend ourselves into financial ruin at taxpayer expense.
Without these we likely would not be able to ""afford"" our endless wars or the broken welfare system.
As President, I would work to undo the horrors of 1913 by abolishing the income tax, auditing the Federal Reserve and put our country back on the path to prosperity with a commodity backed currency.
Alex, will you chip in $19.13, $191.30, of even $1,913 to help me continue our fight against the two-party system responsible for the harm caused by the legislation passed in 1913?
We're so close to our Get-Out-The-Vote goal with a little under $140,000 left to raise!
The supporters of this campaign know the impact of reaching these crucial undecided voters with our message of liberty goes beyond the votes tallied on November 3rd.
No, the impact our supporters have means we come one step closer to freeing the hearts and minds of the American electorate who have long been fed up with the two party system.
Please contribute $19.13 or whatever you can to show we don't have to live with the mistakes of the past but instead we can work together to fix them.

Your support will go directly to voter outreach efforts via ads, texting, the bus tour, and more.

Alex,
How do you feel about last night's debate?
Does it give you more confidence in our country's leadership? Or does it give you more doubt?
Why are two career politicians with horrible records being forced down voters as the only choices?
What if voters learned about another choice?
Alex, that's why I am emailing you with an urgent request. You can help us give voters another choice. They only need to know it's possible and you'd be surprised how many come our way.
Voters don't want to vote for the lesser of two evils anymore. Americans are getting sick of career politicians like Pence and Harris who say one thing and do the opposite.
You can help us reach voters and give them a choice in November. Here's how.
October 14th is the final FEC deadline before the election. We can't wait until the end of the month. The time to act is now. Will you donate $5, $20.20, $50, or whatever you can?
I'm hoping to raise $10,000 before tomorrow. Your support will go directly into reaching voters through our ads, volunteers, texting, and more.
This is our moment, Alex. Help me get our message out to voters.

Alex--
Let's not forget why Jo is running.
1\. The War on Drugs
Roughly 1,500,000 Americans are arrested each year for possession charges only.
Over $47 BILLION a year is spent fighting the war on drugs, which especially targets the poor and communities of color.
Trump and Biden will do nothing to lower this number.
2\. The Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
At least 216,733 U.S. and civilian deaths have occurred since the start of these unconstitutional wars.
The economic costs are equally staggering - $6.4 TRILLION.
Trump has failed to keep his promise of an ""America First"" foreign policy.
Meanwhile, Joe Biden has been endorsed by a slew of Bush's foreign policy advisors
3\. The War on Our Economy
The U.S. Dollar has lost 96% of its value since the creation of the Federal Reserve.
Government shutdowns put over 1 million small businesses at risk of failure. This will permanently eliminate millions of jobs.
The unemployment rate is quickly approaching Great Depression levels while nearly 25% of Americans have no emergency savings.
Trump and Biden will continue to destroy the middle class and America's economy.
We need support from FL today.
Jo is hosting a friendly competition to see which states raise the most money. It will also be calculated per capita so smaller states do not lose out!

Alex,
We are entering two decades of war in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Children are growing up under a constant state of war. Fathers and sons are serving in the same wars.
Where are Joe Biden and Donald Trump on this incredibly important issue? They silently support the military-industrial complex and secretly feed the war machine.
The costs of the warfare state are mind-blowing.
* 31,952 wounded in action.
* 480,000 total deaths.
* 14,771 U.S. service members and contractors have been killed.
* 244,000 civilian deaths.
* Over $6 Trillion wasted.
Alex, this is why we must fight. We are fighting for liberty, peace, and prosperity. This is why I am counting on your immediate support to help our message reach voters.
Can you donate $5, $20.20, $50, or any amount today? You can donate by clicking here >>
What is the message we are sending voters when an overwhelming majority want to leave the Middle East, yet politicians do nothing? Where are the anti-war Democrats? Where is this ""America First"" foreign policy we were promised?
Democrats and Republicans have abandoned you on this important issue. I won't. My immediate priority as President is to bring our troops home.
Help me stop the bloodshed and get this message out to voters. Help me remind voters we can change the direction of our foreign policy.
Send an urgent donation today to help me reach $250,000 by Monday at midnight >>
The only way we can restore a peaceful foreign policy to America is by electing a new leader with the will to smash the war machine to pieces.
I know this is a winning message and it resonates with voters.

The next train-wreck... errr... Presidential debate is happening on Thursday evening. We're waiting in anticipation, but not for the reasons you may suspect...

Jo Jorgensen 2020
Alex, the battle lines have been drawn...
Donald Trump and Joe Biden have chosen the side of crony capitalism, socialism, and big government.
You and I have chosen to fight for the Constitution, free market solutions to healthcare costs, bringing the troops home, and enacting REAL criminal justice reform the American people are crying out for.
Last night proved neither of these men are fit to serve in the White House.
It is up to you and I to fight for liberty and give the American people a choice they can be proud to vote for in November.

Jo Jorgensen (personal),jo_jorgensen@jo20.com,Do NOT delete - Important #LetHerSpeak Update,"Alex, I hope you can take a moment to read the entire email and respond today.
Alex,
I have some time to give you an update from the campaign trail.
I apologize for how long this email is but I hope you can read it and respond immediately.
If you have been watching our video updates on social media, you will know just how busy we are touring the country on the bus! It's been a non-stop effort and the support has been tremendous.
However, I am now faced with our biggest campaign challenge yet... getting on the debate stage!
We have overcome many challenges already. States have tried to deny us ballot access forcing us to collect signatures during a pandemic. I am proud to report we've overcome all of these challenges to date.
Now, I need to make it onto the debate stage. In order to do that, I am counting on your immediate support.
Alex, I do not have the billionaires nor D.C. insiders supporting me like Trump and Biden. Can you Donate $5, $10, $20.20, $50, or more today? Click here to rush your urgent support >>
For the rest of this month ALL donations online will get your first name and last initial added on the side of my tour bus as a special thank you!
My campaign team informed me that you have not donated yet. I hope you can join my campaign with a contribution today, because without more support, I do not know if we will make the debate.
Here's the plan to get in the debates.
In order to make the debate, we need to poll 15% in national polls.
There are two challenges. One, the Commission on Presidential Debates has been corrupt since the 1980s when the two parties took over the debates. It used to be run by non-profits. That is no longer the case. We cannot control this. So they set the threshold very high.
The second challenge is building name ID with voters. Most Americans WANT a 3rd option. A Gallup poll revealed that 57% of Americans say a third major political party is needed.
So why aren't more voters choosing a third party in polls?
I'm being kept out of many national polls as an option and voters do not realize they have another choice.
Here's the solution. It is an obvious one but it won't be easy.
Alex, it's ambitious but I must raise an additional $1 MILLION to reach more voters with ads, gain in the polls, and make the debate. Click here to send an urgent donation >>
I must reach more voters with my message of individual liberty, a peaceful foreign policy, and economic prosperity through free market solutions.
I hope you can make your first time donation by selecting an amount below to donate.
Donate $5
Donate $10
Donate $20.20

Donate $250

Donate Any Amount
Any amount you can urgently send to the campaign will get you your name on our tour bus. I cannot wait to see ""Alex"" on there.
Without sounding too alarmist, the liberty movement in America will depend on what we do now. 2020 will be a historic year for us. We cannot pass up this opportunity. Liberty must win or else our country will fail.
Please send an urgent donation today and help support the campaign. I rely on generous donors online and now is the best time to give in order to have the biggest impact on our movement.
Thank you so much, Alex.
Dr. Jo Jorgensen

Alex --
This is a quick update on two big dates this week.
* October 14th is the final FEC deadline before the election. Jo is looking to raise $50,000 online before Wednesday. Can you send your urgent support today?
* The next debate is on October 15th. We want to make sure we have a big showing for this final FEC deadline before the debate.
After the last debate, we saw a surge of support. A lot of it was new supporters who witnessed a disaster of a debate.
We know voters are looking for an alternative to Trump and Biden. But we need to reach them. Your support will make that possible.
Jo doesn't have the corporate press. She doesn't have the Military Industrial Complex on her side. She only has us - hard-working Americans who believe in liberty.
Please act quickly and help us reach more voters in this final month.

Jo20-Logo
Alex,
I have another campaign update for you! A lot has happened since I last sent you an email about the bus tour, ballot access, fundraising, and media attention.
In case you haven't heard yet... Jo is OFFICIALLY on the ballot on all 50 states!
Alex, this is a massive accomplishment.
We could not have done it without your help. Jo told me to thank all of the activists who helped collect signatures and fought with government bureaucrats to make it all possible.
Thanks to you, the American people can proudly cast their ballot for a candidate they can be proud of.
Liberty is officially on the ballot in November.
Thanks again, Alex. Here is the rest of the campaign update for you:
Bus Tour:
Jo's bus tour across the country is a resounding success and is generating lots of press, locking in support from voters attending events, and rallying our base!
Recently, Jo visited Alaska (no we did not haul the bus through Canada haha) and made a big splash.
The state of Alaska typically does not see Presidential candidates during campaign season so she received a lot of attention. In fact, stories were printed in Alaska Public Media, the Juneau Empire, and The Frontiersman about her campaign stops.
Now, we are embarking on another tour across several western states to meet voters in areas we believe are more likely to cast their vote for Jo.
Please remember to check out the campaign calendar to see if Jo is visiting your state any time soon!
Voter Outreach:
Jo is reaching millions of voters with her message of free markets, healthcare reform, a peaceful foreign policy, and criminal justice reform.
Currently, the campaign is serving ads online and on streaming services to voters with a greater likelihood of voting for Jo in November.
Have you seen our new videos we're using to reach undecideds? You can watch them by clicking here and here.
Support for Trump and Biden is falling apart and Jo's campaign is growing every day. I hope you are proud of everything we've accomplished together!
Fundraising:
Alex, momentum is on our side.
Jo is gaining new supporters every day while Biden and Trump's campaigns are devolving into nothing more than public dumpster fires.
We MUST sustain our campaign's growth and keep fighting. I hope you'll consider making a donation to the campaign today and celebrate our 50 state ballot access victory.

Alex --
Do you realize we have officially reached $27 trillion in federal debt?
This happened under President Trump's watch (the man who promised to ""eliminate"" the debt during his 2016 campaign), however he can't be blamed entirely.
The two-party system has been breaking national debt records administration after administration. Thanks to Trump, Obama, Bush Jr., Bush Sr., and their economic advisors, we have found ourselves in so much debt we cannot possibly repay it.
It's time to dramatically cut spending.
Do you agree?
If you agree with Jo that we must cut spending please add your name to our petition below!
🚨Add Your Name: Stop The Reckless Spending! 🚨
Jo believes we should first start by bringing the troops home and ending corporate welfare entirely.
Where do you think we should cut spending?
Our goal is to find 5,000 signers in the next 48 hours.
Here is how you can help:

It never ceases to amaze me how corrupt the two-party system is. However, I am blown away by the support our campaign is receiving. This is our chance to grow the liberty movement to new heights.

Team Jo,jo_jorgensen@jo20.com,Did you see what Michelle Obama said about Jo Jorgensen?,"Did you see what Michelle Obama said during her DNC convention speech?
jojo-obama
Alex,
While the corporate media were fawning over Michelle Obama's speech at the DNC, we noticed something alarming.
The Obama family is actively pressuring those considering to vote for a third party candidate, including YOU, to vote for Biden. The quote is directly from her speech at the DNC. She made it a point to attack our campaign and others running.
“But this is not the time to withhold our votes in protest or play games with candidates who have no chance of winning.”
Who do they think they are? The arrogance is astounding. The truth is, they are afraid of our message.
They are afraid if the American people hear our message and know they have another choice, then voters will leave both major parties in droves!
That's why we must get past the establishment gatekeepers.
Jo’s supporters have been rallying to “Let Her Speak” all across the country – demanding Jo be included in all presidential debates. However...
* We cannot rely on the rigged Commission on Presidential Debates, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Democratic and Republican parties.
* We cannot rely on the mainstream media, which refuses to cover Jo’s campaign or include Jo's name in polls – which the rigged debate commission uses to decide who “qualifies” for their phony debates.
Instead, Jo is making her case directly to voters online, on the ground, and through TV ads.
But she cannot do it alone and we hope you can send your immediate support today.
Can you please make a recurring donation of $5, $10, $20.20, $50, or even $100 a month until the election?
This is one of our last opportunities to receive monthly gifts as we head into the final months of the race.
Jo does not have the billionaires or corporate media behind her. But she does have your support.

Each dollar raised will go towards reaching voters with Jo's message of liberty.

Subject: Official Ballot Access Update
To: Alex
Jo20-Logo
Alex,
Our fight against the corrupt two-headed monster (the two-party system) is escalating.
Here is the official update on our fight for ballot access:
These are the states we have left to lock in ballot access: Maine, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arkansas, New Hampshire, Iowa, Minnesota, Alabama, Virginia, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Minnesota.
Alex, we are facing an unprecedented ballot access fight that no other Libertarian candidate has had to deal with.
Many of these states have SHUTDOWN public spaces, are forcing people to stay indoors, and making it difficult to collect the signatures needed to secure ballot access.
The establishment is using the COVID19 crisis to keep our campaign off of the ballot.
I am REFUSING to let them get away with this.
I am deploying paid petitioners and running online ads to collect signatures in these KEY states. Please click here to donate $5, $20.20, $50, $100 or more to secure ballot access in all 50 states >>

Alex, my team's records indicate that you have yet to contribute. Time is running out for us to get on the ballot in these critical states. Now is the best time to give.
The fight against the establishment is ramping up and I'm worried I will not reach our goal of $500,000 before the end of the month.
I don't want to alarm you, but Trump and Biden are expected to raise millions! Voters deserve another choice. Our future depends on another choice.
If we do not make it on the ballot, then many voters will be left without a real option.
Please make your first time donation today by clicking here.
I know with your support we can take down the corrupt establishment that controls our nation.
Thank you!

Alex,
We are officially 90 days out from the election.
56 days until the first Presidential debate.
And I am building a historic campaign in less than 6 months.
In order to qualify for the debates, I have to be on enough state ballots to win a majority of electoral votes. Check! ✔️
Here's the challenging part. I must receive 15% in 5 national polls.
Building up my name ID with voters is the key. My campaign team is working on this day and night, but frankly, I am asking them to double down and increase their efforts. I am doing everything possible to ensure I am in the Presidential Debates and give Americans a REAL choice in November.
1. I am touring the United States in key battleground states. You may have seen the bus tour officially begin in Pennsylvania.
2. My team is DOUBLING ad spend on streaming services and we have Tripled ad spend on social media compared to the end of July.
3. All of this requires immense resources - staff, bus expenses, advertising, mail, etc. I am hoping you can donate today and help get me into the debate.
I am building a multi-million dollar organization in less than 6 months! I am incredibly proud we've raised over $1 million so far. However, in order to scale, we'll need a $1 million month in August.
Alex, can you please send an urgent donation to help get me in the Presidential debate? Click here to donate $10, $20.20, $50, $100, $250, $500 or more >>
Voters deserve another choice. It should NOT be the lesser of two evils. That is still supporting evil.
I am not going to sugar coat it, Alex. The Commission on Presidential Debates, the media who are conducting the polls, and the laws themselves are biased against 3rd parties. It's a corrupt system.
Yet, there is a way. With new online media, we are able to reach people and build a Libertarian movement like never before. Each year we continue to grow and this year can be historic.

It's the final two weeks of the election!
Jo is seeing a surge from the horrible debate performance by both Trump and Biden. However, many voters still do not realize there's another candidate on all 50 state ballots. We must reach those voters this week.

For every dollar raised, Jo can reach 7 to 11 voters with her message of peace, prosperity, and liberty for all.

Duoploy Meme
Jo Star Wars
(Don't worry... Jo's trigger discipline is better than this)
Toy Story Meme
It's no secret Jo's supporters are the most enthusiastic of all the candidates running for President.
No one in the Democratic Party is exactly thrilled about Joe Biden and his disgusting lifelong record of being a drug warrior and advocate for tough-on-crime legislation.
And President Trump has millions of Republicans who identify themselves as ""Never Trump Republicans"".
Alex, we have the support and momentum behind us to make history on November 3rd.
Let's reach more voters with our message of free markets, reduced healthcare costs, bringing the troops home, and ending the failed war on drugs.

Alex,
My name is Jess Mears. I serve as Jo's Deputy Campaign Manager. I thought I would shoot you an email to introduce myself, give you a campaign update, and tell you how you can help spread our message.
Bus Tour:
So far, Jo has held events in 33 states in targeted areas we believe will be crucial for earning votes and media attention. She's met thousands of voters, earned local media attention at each stop, and I'm happy to report her message is resonating with voters considering voting for a third-party candidate!
Do you want to know what I learned about Jo on the bus tour? She deeply cares about people. She is passionate about the ideas of liberty and truly believes our principles can lift millions out of poverty, create new jobs, and help people.
Name ID:
As I'm sure you're aware, one of our greatest challenges is educating Americans about the REAL choice they have this election cycle! We are tirelessly working to boost Jo's Name ID.
We are doing so by investing much of our campaign funds into Facebook advertising and playing ads on streaming services such as Hulu and others.
Polls have demonstrated 75% of Americans desire a strong third-party candidate.
These are our voters! It is our responsibility to let voters know they have another choice this election. They can vote for criminal justice reform, bringing the troops home, cutting taxes, cutting spending, restoring our privacy, and for the Constitution!
Fundraising:
Let's face it... this is everyone's least favorite part of campaigning. Let me tell you why your donation is so important and how it makes an impact.
By donating to Jo's campaign you are telling the Establishment the American people are rising up and wish to dismantle the two-party system.
You are empowering Jo to spread our message of liberty, limited government, and free markets by investing in the campaign. Jo will use your contribution to increase her name ID and speak truth to power.

I want to talk to you about this moment that we are all living in and what incredible change can come when we embrace liberty today.
There is no doubt that generations of ruling class Republicans and Democrats have failed the American people. They have worked together, despite what they may publicly portray, and have given us the broken system we fight against today.
Those in power crave more power, and fear nothing more than losing the power they have. It benefits both sides in Washington to keep all of us angry and afraid of what “the other side” might do if given the chance.
What we have forgotten, as voters and citizens of this country, is that we are the power.
Citizens grant power when we vote, and we can take that power back when we vote because this country was built on the power of real people!

My hope is not to make you empty promises but to show you the difference that a commitment to liberty and not a search for power can bring for all of us.
Over $26 trillion in debt, and a $3 trillion annual deficit
The IRS taxes Americans at every turn, and our tax system is so complicated that only those who can afford personal accountants and tax lawyers are able to navigate the code.
Meanwhile, the government accumulates more debt. Some politicians demand increases in domestic spending, while others insist upon increases in military spending — they come to a bipartisan compromise by increasing both. This was epitomized by the $2 trillion CARES Act which, in our country’s most dire time of need, was filled with waste and gave billions in corporate handouts.
It's time for real change!
As your President, I will push for the elimination of the IRS and work with Congress toward eliminating the federal income tax altogether.
When it comes to cutting spending, we cannot take any solutions off the table. I would encourage baseline budgeting: instead of assuming an increase, we start at zero every year and decide what can be eliminated and what is absolutely necessary.

Never-ending involvement in expensive and deadly foreign wars
Soldiers are currently deployed who were not even born when our “War on Terror” began.
Since 2001, over half a million people have been killed in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. Our troops are stationed in nearly 150 different countries. The US spends more on its military than the next ten countries combined. Our government has increasingly engaged in drone warfare, even striking weddings and hospitals.
The names and faces of war may change, but the impacts of interventionist strategies remain the same.
Nation-building and regime change create power vacuums and greater distrust of the United States, and we are left to deal with the same issues decade after decade. In every election candidates promise peace but they only deliver more war.
It’s time for real change!
As your President, I will seek to audit the Pentagon to ensure every dollar is spent responsibly, will submit a bill to Congress to cut the Defense budget in half and I will bring the troops home.

Skyrocketing healthcare and health insurance costs
When politicians say, “we need Medicare for all,” what I hear is “VA hospitals for all.”
The Veterans Administration is among the worst in our healthcare system. This standard is unacceptable for any person, let alone those willing to sacrifice their lives for their country.
Let’s be honest - the current American healthcare system isn’t working for anyone. That is, anyone other than the wealthy and the well-connected who always have access to care, or the billion-dollar insurance companies that bring in new record profits every year.
My heart breaks for the millions of Americans who have been left behind.
For decades politicians have insisted that it is the free market that has failed us. I have news for them: we haven’t had anything even close to a free and competition-based system in nearly a century!
The alternative to our current big-government failure is not to embrace an even BIGGER government failure.
It’s time for real change!
As your President, I will fight to convert the VA healthcare system to one which gives veterans control over their healthcare dollars to do with as they wish. We will reform the FDA approval and patent process for prescription medications.
The FDA has completely mismanaged the COVID-19 crisis. They give special privileges to companies with enough money and resources, and then weaponize patents to keep out competitors.
As President, I will work with the FDA to remove barriers to new prescription drugs and make more medications available over-the counter. Until we end the federal income tax, I will propose that healthcare expenditures for individuals be tax deductible in the same way they are for employers.
I am running for President because the American people are done being force-fed different flavors of the same poison.
The policies I have outlined today aren’t about theories; they are about the middle-class worker who has to decide whether to buy medicine or pay for rent.
They are about the soldier deployed to a foreign land for no good reason, and the person living there who feels like their country is being occupied.
I am asking you to support my campaign not because I presume to know the best way to live your life, rather to provide the best opportunity for you to pursue the life that you want to live.
Join me and join the Libertarian Party as we bring our principles of individual liberty to campaigns across the country from municipal races all the way to the White House.
It is time to remove the shackles of the duopoly and journey toward real liberty for all people all the time.

Jo Jorgensen,jo_jorgensen@jo20.com,Let's Talk: This is why I am a Libertarian,"one of the most common questions I am asked on the campaign trail when I am meeting new voters is, ""why are you a Libertarian?"".
Jo Jorgensen 2020
Reminder: Jo has an October 14th FEC deadline. Please consider chipping in here.
Alex, one of the most common questions I am asked on the campaign trail when I am meeting new voters is, ""why are you a Libertarian?"".
Great question!
I am thrilled to hear this question so often. It means our message is spreading far beyond hardcore Libertarians. Independents, first-time voters, disenfranchised Democrats and Republicans are learning about our campaign and want to know more about the ideas of liberty.
Allow me to make my case and answer why I identify as a Libertarian:
The Constitutional Case:
I believe our Founding Fathers authored a Constitution that has allowed the United States to become one of the freest and most prosperous nations on Earth.
The Constitution is the answer to many of today's great problems.
* I support your right to bear arms because it is clearly laid out in the Constitution...
* I agree Congress must DECLARE wars. The President does NOT have the authority to do so without congressional authority because of the Constitution...
* I wish to tear down the NSA's illegal spying apparatus because of the Fourth Amendment in the Constitution...
Are you starting to see the pattern? Unlike Trump and Biden, I look to the wisdom of our Founding Fathers and the Constitution for the challenges our country is facing.
This makes me a Libertarian.
The Moral Case: (Warning: This one usually doesn't appeal to people like Biden or Trump)
I don't think we should hurt people or take their stuff.
Pretty simple.
Libertarians respect property rights and believe stealing people's hard-earned money is wrong. We believe wars of aggression are wrong. We believe whatever you are doing in your bedroom is your own business.
A free society built on respect for property rights, individual liberties, and economic freedom creates a prosperous and flourishing world.
The Economic Case:
Libertarians believe in economic freedom.
We wish to cut spending, terminate all corporate welfare, remove regulations, and ultimately eliminate the income tax.
Free markets create jobs, raise people out of poverty, and create solutions for problems we face. If we allowed the free market to be unleashed upon the healthcare industry we would see prices plummet almost instantly.
Alex, Democrats and Republicans have lost all semblance of principles and integrity.
If you agree with these ideas, I hope you will consider supporting our campaign today with a small online donation.

Alex,
Did you see Fox News cover Jo's analysis of who the worst President in U.S. history is?
Jo gave the great dishonor to former President Woodrow Wilson for passing or ratifying both the 16th Amendment (the income tax) and the establishment of the Federal Reserve.
There are of course other reasons to dislike him (spending, his foreign policy, arresting journalists, record on race, etc.).
However, Fox News decided to cover Jo's analysis and she's SURGED on Google Trends right before the election!
Check out this screenshot of Jorgensen SURGING on Google Trends for our media hit on Fox news:

Jo Jorgensen 2020
Alex,
The War on Drugs is a failure.
In 2020, we have witnessed a massive spike in demand for criminal justice reform after a series of tragic, unnecessary deaths and cases of clear-cut police abuse.
Allegedly, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are promising to enact real reform... Don't hold your breath.
Their entire careers in public office say otherwise.
Donald Trump? The man has had four years to end the War on Drugs and failed to deliver.
Jo would officially put an end to the drug war, abolish the DEA, pardon non-violent drug offenders, and empower addicts to seek help and rehabilitation rather than face prison for their victimless mistakes.

Ending the War on Drugs could heal our nation's cities, relieve local governments of millions of dollars in police and prison costs, and create new jobs in the growing cannabis industry.
More and more Americans support ending this disaster.
But politicians are too afraid to act.

Edward Snowden exposed the lies of our government.
He exposed the government was collecting data on millions of Americans without a warrant and was LYING, under oath, in front of the Senate it was happening.
The repercussions? Snowden is in forced exile in Russia. James Clapper, who lied directly to the people of the United States, continued serving as Director of National Intelligence and now is a talking head on CNN.
It sounds like Orwellian fiction but sadly, it's the reality of the American government.
Alex, our campaign is a threat to this status quo. I would pardon Edward Snowden on day one.

Alex --
The bipartisan-duopoly that controls our media and our institutions is trying to silence Jo Jorgensen and keep her out of the debate.
The Commission on Presidential Debates is corrupt. The polls do not include Jo or even give her a chance to make the debate threshold. On top of that, the laws are biased against 3rd party candidates.
But we won't be silenced.
Jo will not be silenced.

Let us fill you in on some of our campaign strategy.
Not only are we starting to run this video ad online and on streamlining services to voters, but we have bigger plans for it... We are planning on running it DURING the live debates. If they refuse to let Jo speak, then we will still bring our message to voters.
Alex, here's how you can help.
Right now we need to reach more voters. This all requires immense resources. Jo doesn't have the corporations and billionaires supporting her. She relies on real Americans who believe in liberty.

Alex --
Jo Jorgensen is counting on your immediate response today to defeat the corrupt two-party system and spread the message of liberty to voters.
Here's what our movement is up against - The Trump/Biden duopoly.
* Both Trump/Biden feed the military industrial complex war machine overseas.
* The duopoly supports domestic spying on all Americans.
* The duopoly will not defend your rights - especially the 2nd Amendment.
* The duopoly has inflated our currency and is set to destroy our economy. They have added $6 TRILLION to the debt since March!
Alex, Jo doesn't have the corporate sponsors like Trump and Biden. She only has you. Can you please donate $5, $20.20, $50, $100, or more today?
The vast majority of voters want a 3rd party option.
Jo is the only other candidate who can win the Electoral College and give voters an honest choice for President.
It may seem like a daunting task to defeat the duopoly. But Jo is already making inroads. Jo is now the only 3rd party candidate on electoral ballots that is eligible to win the Electoral College.

Jo Jorgensen 2020
Alex,
Did you see Edward Snowden's appearance on the powerful Joe Rogan today?
Let me make it clear.
I will fully pardon Snowden and other government whistleblowers who have served or are currently serving time under the draconian Espionage Act for providing information to journalists.
These are heroes who sacrificed everything to expose corruption, restore our privacy, and end foreign wars of aggression.
It's one thing to supply information to foreign spies. But the Espionage Act is being unfairly used against whistleblowers who are bringing necessary information to the public for the good of the American people.
There are many great reforms our country desperately needs that Trump and Biden will never dare to touch.
* Ending the Espionage Act
* Ending the Patriot Act
* Holding officials like James Clapper accountable to lying to Congress
How can the American public ever trust our government again if they aren't willing to make these reforms after everything Ed Snowden as revealed?
Let's get this message out to voters!
Ed Snowden went on Joe Rogan because the mainstream media is corrupt, partisan, and in on the scam.
Likewise, we must spread our message of ending the surveillance of innocent Americans and bringing justice to whistleblowers for exposing corruption.
You can help us, Alex.
Can you rush a donation of $5, $20.20, $50 or more? Your support will go directly towards bypassing the mainstream media.
We've successfully secured a position on the ballot in all 50 states. Now, we must continue reaching more voters before the election.

Jo Jorgensen 2020
Alex,
She wasn't on the stage but she was still a big winner from the first presidential debate.
Americans hated what they saw from Trump and Biden, and millions of them pulled out their phone to google Jorgensen. We had a huge spike on Google.
The traffic was overwhelming, We're hustling to keep up and prepare for the next onslaught, which we expect to happen during the next debate. You can help pay for this work by making a contribution.
Meanwhile...
You can watch what Jo was saying during her debate interview with Elizabeth Nolan Brown, or read direct answers to the specific questions asked during the Trump-Biden debate...
Dr. Jo Jorgensen answers the debate questions
Q: What are your views on Supreme Court appointments?
A: I would only appoint people who will actually obey the Constitution, including especially the rigorous limitations placed on government power by the 9th and 10th Amendments.
Q: What are your healthcare plans?
A: I would work to restore free-market healthcare. We need price visibility and competition to lower costs.
Q: What would you do about COVID-19, shutdowns, and masks?
A: I would let businesses decide whether to be open and when, where, and how masks must be worn. Customers could then make their own choices about where to go or not go based on those individual policies.
Q: What would you do about a vaccine?
A: I won't pretend to be America's pharmacologist in chief. Vaccine providers must do their job, and then individual Americans should be free to decide whether or not to take the resulting vaccines.
Q: What would you do about the economy?
A: The private sector uses resources better than the government. So I would cut government spending dramatically and put those resources back into the productive economy.
Q: What would you do about taxes?
A: I will cut taxes as fast as I can. Individual Americans will make better use of the money.
Q: What would you do about race relations in America?
A: Great Society programs destroyed black families. Then the Nixon administration launched the drug war to further devastate the black community. Then Senator Biden passed a crime bill that placed huge numbers of black men behind bars. I would end the drug war and all the other laws that police use to harass black people.
Q: How would you change policing in America?
A: I would repeal all victimless crime laws, so police would have fewer reasons to hassle people. I would also outlaw qualified immunity so that police can be held responsible for the consequences of their actions. The result would be fewer dead citizens and fewer dead cops.
Q: What would you do about the protests?
A: The Democrats and Republicans both use laws to impose things on people against their will. This makes people angry. I would work to repeal all such laws, thereby reducing the anger.
Q: Why should voters prefer you?
A: I won't use the government to impose things on them against their will. I'll free them to make their own choices provided they respect the equal right of others to do the same.
Q: What would you do about forest fires?
A: I notice that most wildfires start on public lands. I would try to put more lands in private hands and instruct the Forest Service to emulate what the private sector does to prevent fires.
Q: What would you do about global warming?
A: Increased use of nuclear power would do more to reduce carbon emissions than any other policy. I would end subsidies that favor other forms of energy, and remove obstacles that block the wider adoption of nuclear power.
Q: What do you think about election integrity?
A: Election integrity starts by letting all the ballot-qualified candidates appear in the debates.

Alex,
This week, Americans will have the opportunity to watch Debate Train-wreck 2.0 with Mike Pence and Kamala Harris in the Vice Presidential Debate.
Mike Pence will serve as a shill for the Trump administration.
He will say anything to defend Trump's terrible record on spending and increasing the debt by TRILLIONS of dollars all while pretending to be a so-called, ""conservative"".
Kamala Harris will regurgitate everything she learned in debate prep to avoid discussing her horrendous record on criminal justice reform.
Biden and Harris are both responsible for locking up THOUSANDS of men and women for victimless crimes and have never apologized or done anything to rectify their mistakes.
In fact, Kamala Harris laughed about smoking pot on a podcast while failing to do anything to help the people hurt by the War on Drugs.
Make No Mistake: This is a fake debate and neither Mike Pence nor Kamala Harris will answer for their terrible mistakes.
Alex, Jo and I are fighting for REAL criminal justice reform and to pardon those Pence and Harris have locked up for victimless crimes...
We're fighting to cut spending and save our country from financial ruin...
We're fighting to unleash the free market to save our failing healthcare system...
And we're fighting to bring the troops home...
But we need your help.
The next FEC deadline is actually October 14th. Many of our contributions arrive near the end of the month... that won't work this time.

Jo Jorgensen 2020
Alex,
There may be times in life when we accept having a choice between only two options, but our elections shouldn’t be one of them.
We don’t have to settle or vote for the lesser of two evils. On November 3, we have the opportunity to vote for what we believe. We have a chance to cast a vote we can be proud of—for a presidential candidate who respects the American people and our system of government.
We have that chance because we have Jo Jorgensen.
Jo and her team have spent months crisscrossing the country to meet voters where they are. She’s on the ballot in every state, and she’s been busy spreading the message of liberty on TV, radio, podcasts, and social media.
But there are still a few days left until the election, and the work isn’t over yet.
Will you pitch in to help Jo fund her final persuasion and Get-Out-The-Vote (GOTV) efforts?
You can help fund these vital efforts by making an online contribution of $20.20, $35, $50, $100, $250, $500, or even more by clicking here.
I became an independent last year because I realized neither of the old parties reflect my values, and I saw how both sides intentionally sow division for their own benefit. I joined the Libertarian Party because its fundamental principles, like our founding principles, are rooted in protecting people’s rights and maximizing happiness, and I can see that it has what it takes to be successful.
And I’m not alone.
There are millions of Americans out there right now who feel disenfranchised or politically homeless—many of whom are libertarians and just don't know it yet.
Jo needs to reach them and show them the way home, but she can’t do that without your help.
Breaking through the two-party system is a big job, but every dollar donated and spent today to show people there’s a better way forward will pay dividends both on Election Day and far into the future.
I hope you’ll help Jo reach more voters, grow the party, and send a message to the Washington establishment by giving as much as you can.

Jo's campaign is building a Libertarian movement across the country. As the only candidate on the ballot in all 50 states, Jo is the alternative to voters. We want to show Jo's support comes from every zip code.
Can you represent 32009 and chip in $5, $20.20, $50, $100, or any amount? Click here to donate >>
Tomorrow is the final FEC deadline before the election. Your support will be critical in this final month to reach voters, get out the vote, and build up the strongest Libertarian movement ever!
Jo saw a surge after the debates. Voters want a candidate who is real and not out of touch. They are tired of choosing between the lesser of two evils.
Alex, here's the reality. If everyone chipped in even $1, then Jo would surpass her goal of $100,000 by tomorrow.
Please use one of the links below to rush your support today.

Longing for Liberty
from Film Mavericks PRO
In 2020 most Americans see themselves as stuck between two bad options for President. But another alternative is on every American's ballot... Dr. Jo Jorgensen.
This documentary feature film follows the campaign of Dr. Jorgensen, the first woman to be on all 50 state ballots in 2 Presidential elections.
2020 has been a year which will forever live in infamy. The Presidential election has American's baffled at how they found themselves in this horrible situation. Stuck between President Donald Trump and Vice-President Joe Biden, many Americans see the situation as hopeless.
The government by virtue of a global pandemic has forced the shutdown of businesses all over the nation leaving record joblessness, an unstable stock-market and little hope for many Americans.
This film was made as an effort to discover if Dr. Jorgensen is the President we need to make America the land of Liberty for ALL people.

## Choice Matters
by Liz Solomon and TJ Ferreira
Road3
We have all heard of the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD). The CPD, whose ludicrous rule for inclusion in the debates insists that a candidate “have a level of support at least 15% of the national electorate as determined by five national public opinion polling organizations selected by the commission.” This is a ploy by the duopoly to showcase the two major parties and hide third parties from sight of the American public.
The polls used by the commission are:
* ABC/Washington Post Poll
* CNN Poll
* Fox News Poll
* NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll
* NPR/PBS NewsHour pe
How many of these polls do you think included Dr. Jo Jorgensen, Libertarian candidate for President? Zero. If a candidate is excluded from the “selected polls,” does the commission expect that candidate to achieve the minimum? No, the commission neither expects the candidate to succeed, nor does it care. The CPD wants you to believe that there are only two choices, because they are bipartisan.
However, Libertarians and other third parties are no longer alone in their frustrations with the CPD. Republicans, Democrats, and independents want to make an informed decision too. Enter, the Committee for American Debate (CAD). Have you heard of it? It is a nonpartisan organization looking to compete with the CPD!
The criteria for qualifying for an invitation to the CAD debates: 1) be Constitutionally eligible to hold the office of the President of the United States, and 2) appear on all 50 state ballots and the District of Columbia ballot. No polls, no nonsense. Dr. Jo Jorgensen, former Vice President Joe Biden, and President Donald Trump are invited to the first debate. Time and date will be determined. Dr. Jorgensen has, of course, accepted the invitation.
In the past, we tried to get into the CPD debates by appealing to the CPD, appealing to the American people, and through lawsuits disputing the partisan nature of the CPD. All of our attempts failed. The difference between our past attempts and this new effort is that we are appealing to the free market. If an organization has a monopoly and is supplying a sub-par service, the best way to break that monopoly is to offer a competing service. The CAD is positioned to compete with the CPD in this election and future elections.
To legitimize the Committee for American Debate please consider signing the petition and following the social media accounts for further updates. You can read more about the CAD and sign the petition on its website.  [[URL REDACTED]]
## Life After The Election
By Jennifer Imhoff
Let me be the first to admit - My dishes are piling up, my sleep schedule is less predictable than the economy, coffee became a meal, and the camera is off on most Zoom calls these days. I can’t wait for it to end, but I also don’t want it to end. And after talking to a few of my friends in the campaign, I don’t think I’m alone.
It’s easy to get hooked on the fortuity of a presidential campaign. Every day presents a new challenge that can be both intimidating, frustrating, and rewarding. We’ve lost track of the hats we wear and the accomplishments we can use to polish up our resumes. People we’ve never formally met have become daily names in our homes. And we’ve given up on taking notes of the things that woulda, coulda, and shoulda been part of the campaign.
For the last few months many of you have put your loyalty to Jo and Spike above daily tasks. You can’t even go to the grocery store without talking to someone about Jorgensen, leaving a flyer behind, or contemplating how we can target a new audience. But as important as your loyalty to the candidates has been - don’t forget your loyalty to yourself.
Like a summer camp romance, we know that November 4th will begin a new era in our lives politically and personally and an end to our sleepless campaigning routines. And right now, it's hard to imagine what life will be like after the election. For some of us, this was our first taste of campaigning, and for others, we are political sommeliers who understand the complexities of the bittersweet taste an election leaves. Regardless of where on that experience spectrum you fall, for many of us, this won’t be our last campaign.
If you think this is your last, November 4th will bring a calm of “at least I tried it.” I encourage you to carry pride, knowing you did what citizens in other countries could only dream of: you exercised your right to democracy and directly worked toward improving the republic. Savor the experience, even if you didn't like the flavor. And if there's one major take away, it's an insider's understanding of just how powerfully money and law influence campaigns.
If this isn’t your last campaign, or at least are open to the idea of another, now is a great time to start networking. Get the phone numbers and email addresses of those whom you enjoyed working with, send a compliment up the ladder for that person who made your job easier, and take a minute to reflect on who was a mentor to your experience. These steps will be critical to your success in future campaigns.
No matter what you do next, you owe it to yourself to start planning. Start to reset your sleep schedule now, and remember to eat a little healthier during this last stretch of the campaign. And note even the smallest wins you’ve made: a new trick in Excel, a new title for your resume, or a new friend you made along the way. That list is longer than you think.
And for those friends I have made but faces I've never seen, the ones who've been my eyes from the ground at times and eyes from the skyscraper at others - I hope to see them at the election night party so we can re-enact that moment when McClane and Sgt. Powell met for the first time.

Jo Jorgensen 2020
Alex, you and I have a grand opportunity in 2020 no one is talking about...
Recent polls in Alaska and Virginia show I am polling over Gary Johnson's numbers in 2016. Even better, Libertarian candidates in Arkansas and Indiana are polling high in their races which will help fuel voter turnout for our campaign as well.
We have a real opportunity of securing more than 5% of the popular vote this year.
What does this mean?
Any party that secures more than 5% of the popular vote is eligible for public funding and would make ballot access FAR easier in several states.
This would be a BIG step towards defeating the two-party system for good.
Alex, this is a major call-to-action. I have instructed all volunteers and campaign staff to do EVERYTHING in our power to achieve this 5% threshold.
But I need your help. I am launching our GOTV (Get-Out-The-Vote) fundraising goal of $350,000 and am asking you to consider making the biggest donation you can today.
Stand with Jo: Donate $20.20
Stand with Jo: Donate $50
Stand with Jo: Donate $100
Stand with Jo: Donate $250
Stand with Jo: Donate $500
Stand with Jo: Donate $1,000
Stand with Jo: Donate any amount!
We have a big problem though...
We must immediately raise $50,000 today or we could be in big trouble. Facebook is preventing all campaigns from placing ads after October 26th. Which means, I must raise funds quickly in order to fund our voter outreach efforts on this platform.
Let's start with a bang.
I am setting our goal to raise $50,000 by the end of the day to ensure we continue reaching voters as they are deciding to vote.
Alex, I'm counting on your help to make this possible.
Help me spread our message of free markets, a peaceful foreign policy, criminal justice reform, putting an end to the failed War on Drugs, and defending the Constitution.
Winning hearts and minds with the message of liberty is not a battle that will be won in a single election. However, I KNOW we can move the needle and make the Founding Fathers proud of us.

Jo Jorgensen 2020
Alex,
The fight for freedom is never over.
I'm confronted every day with the reasons why I decided to run.
I see Trump and Biden continuing the wars overseas. How many more lives are we going to sacrifice in this unending quagmire?
I hear Trump and Biden speaking about their authority as though they are the ones who grant you freedom. They do not think twice about using government as an instrument to enforce their will or the will of their followers.
Then, we have the recent news of Breonna Taylor. And my heart aches with pain. The government is allowed to kick in your door and you have no right to respond. The war on drugs has gone too far. And sadly, I see NO difference between Trump and Biden.
I'll be frank with you, Alex.
The reason I decided to run for office is bigger than the office itself. It's bigger than this one-time election.
We are out to build a movement. The future is ours, because the American people share our ideas and we won't be silenced.
I am fighting every day to build this movement. And I am emailing you for your help.
My campaign is looking to raise $300,000 before midnight on September 30th. That's two days from now. Can you click here to donate $5, $20.20, $50, or any amount you can afford?
We have seen the liberty movement grow, but I'm afraid we need to do more to bring in voters to our cause.
We don't have the corporate media.
We don't have the laws on our side.
But we do have YOU.
I am counting on your support to reach this important goal. You will help us bring the message of liberty to new voters and inspire a new generation of liberty activists.

The Giant Money Meteor results are in, and the winner is … Delaware! Okay, actually we are ALL winners, collecting nearly $200,000 in donations in a week and a half. Delaware had the best results, achieving 213% of their baseline goal and making 106% of their stretch goal! Six other states exceeded their fundraising goals, with Montana in second place, followed by Utah, Arizona, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. Well done!

In the perennial competition between California and Texas, California brought in the most total donations with $19,000, while Texas had the most individual donors at 458.
Thank you to everyone who participated, donated, or helped with this fundraising campaign. Your efforts will help us reach an extra million people by text bank and 20 million people over social media!

CATCHING TORI
By Liz Solomon
I had the pleasure of catching up with Victoria “Tori” Leroy this week via telephone. I have to assume that Tori is as pleasant to text with as she is on the phone, which is probably why she is so successful! Since joining the phone bank, Tori has texted nearly 50,000 people on behalf of the Jo Jorgensen for President campaign. This is five times the size of her hometown in Washington! Tori and I talked about her schedule, starting with campaigns on the East Coast and working her way to the West. We talked about the time she gives herself for responding to people who text back. In addition to texting, nearly full-time, as she explains later, she juggles life and a toddler! I asked Tori about her most interesting interaction. She said it was with someone who, after texting back and forth, conceded to check out Jo Jorgensen instead of giving her further push back! Here is Tori, in her own words:
Liz: How is it possible to send 40,000 text messages?
Tori: It takes commitment, for sure, all of my free time is dedicated to getting those texts out. A certain level of passion for what we're doing also really helps. The biggest thing is to not jump in, thinking you'll get those kinds of numbers out right away; it comes after getting to know the system.
Liz: What kind of time commitment does it take to send so many messages?
Tori: It's become a second full-time job, honestly. I thoroughly enjoy doing it, though, so the majority of the time I don't even notice how much time I have spent working on the campaigns. Even if you just do it in your spare time, you'll be able to get thousands of messages out to people.
Liz: Do you have special equipment?
Tori: I use a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse so that I have a bit more mobility when dealing with my son: other than that, no, just a computer and the Internet.
Liz: How do you juggle being a full time text volunteer for the Jo Campaign and being a mom?
Tori: That's what I love about the program! It seriously offers so much flexibility. I'm able to text all over the country, which opens up so much time to do it.
Liz: What is the best response you've received from a text message?
Tori: My all time favorite interactions with people are when they start off completely disinterested. Then you start playing along with them, and it spikes their interest in Jo. It offers a level of satisfaction that maybe, just maybe, I was able to sway that person into voting for someone that actually has the American people in mind.
Liz: Do you have a favorite texting campaign?
Tori: I don't, mostly because you come across so many witty and clever people all over this country. It's hard to pinpoint one area that I've enjoyed working on more than others.
Liz: How do you plan to stay on top of the texting and beat Ryan Cooper?
Tori: I truly hope someone can beat me, because that means we have reached out to so many people! Healthy competition is great, but my main goal is to work with some amazing people and let people know about the third option that is on our ballots. I'm just going to keep what I'm doing and keep it at that.
Tori’s personal goal is to reach 100,000 people by the end of the campaign. Will anyone catch up to Tori? We’re rooting for you, Tori; you can do it! If you’d like to get involved with the text bank, please join us on one of the following Zoom calls listed below:
Training sessions for new users are held every Tuesday and Thursday from 5pm-11pm EDT / 2pm-8pm PDT.

Why “Non-Essential Workers” Need a Libertarian President
from Genet Jones
There is a sign on the fence of a nearby independent-living complex that says, “To our police, healthcare providers, and other essential workers: THANK YOU!”
Every time I drive by that sign, I feel the urge to add another one next to it that says, “To everyone else: please don’t let anyone tell you that you are not essential.”
If you put food on the table for yourself or your family, you are essential. If you are working your way through your degree or skills training, your work is essential.
No human being deserves to be labeled “non-essential.”
But the entrenched political parties are perfectly happy to label you non-essential. They have made it clear for decades that whatever words they throw around on the podium, when it comes to their actions—the laws and policies they support—they have no problem throwing the average American, and the disadvantaged American, under the bus.
Republican and Democrat governors alike locked down their states and destroyed family businesses with the proverbial stroke of a pen. “Two weeks to flatten the curve” turned into months of lockdown, restrictions, harassment, polarization of health concerns, and massive unemployment.
Politicians at every level favor or even subsidize some industries, penalize others, and protect still others from competition or from liability to consumers. You as a consumer are treated as far less essential than those protected industries. And it doesn’t matter if your business is essential to your family; if it conflicts with the agenda of the best-paying lobbyists, even in a pre-Covid world, you were less than non-essential.
But the libertarian ethos is that everyone is essential. No one is less important than anyone else.
You may have heard this from other political parties, but they do not practice what they preach. On a daily basis, they enact laws and make policies that favor some groups of people over others—not to mention that politicians are the most favored group of all.
Each of us is an essential human being with unique talents and personal goals that matter the same as anyone else’s. This is why Libertarians believe that everyone deserves to make their own decisions about risk and reward, have equal protection under the law, and not get their livelihood thrown under the bus by the governor, the mayor, or the health department.
A Libertarian president would help to actually end police brutality, making it easier and safer for good police officers to do their jobs, by ending qualified immunity. Police officers are essential. So are the people they are sworn to protect. The way we respect both these truths is to make sure that those few police officers who don’t respect the value of life are never again allowed to represent the law. Getting rid of laws that protect them from prosecution is the only way to begin making that happen.
A Libertarian president would end the war on drugs, releasing millions of victimless “offenders” to live their essential lives with their families and communities, and opening up the growing marijuana industry to thousands of businesses and workers.
A Libertarian president would bring our troops home from entanglements all over the world, recognizing that those men and women are essential to their families, and essential for protecting our country, but not for policing the world. The Libertarian perspective that every person is essential makes it clear that sending our troops around the globe to intimidate the rest of the world is not only wasting the lives of our troops but also making all Americans less safe at home by virtue of our leaders making enemies abroad.
Whether you are serving your community as an “essential worker” or one who has been labeled “non-essential,” remember that if the government has the power today to label your neighbors non-essential and take away their means to live, then tomorrow it has the power to do that to you—unless we make a real change.
A Libertarian vote in 2020 is a vote to protect the essential in every one of us.

Jo Jorgensen 2020
Alex,
The election is around the corner. Our movement has grown bigger than I could have ever imagined. I truly believe this campaign is creating a resurgence in the ideas of freedom.
As an educator, it would be negligent if I didn't offer some of my favorite books to help spread liberty. These books opened my eyes on many issues and inform many of my positions.
Before I share my list of books, can you please consider donating $5, $20.20, $50, or any amount you can afford? Donate here >>
We are winning over last-minute voters. Many voters have decided to abandon the corrupt two parties. Now more than ever, voters will be discussing the ideas to shape our country.
Send your support to reach them before the election.
Here are some of the books that have shaped my perspective and worldview. Below is NOT a ranking.
1\. Henry Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson
2\. Milton Friedman's Free to Choose
3\. Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged
4\. George Orwell’s Animal Farm
Alex, let's continue to spread the brush fires of liberty.
I share these books with you because our country needs powerful ideas to make sure we don't fall into the hands of socialists or fascists.
And our campaign is making sure the ideas of individualism, peaceful foreign policy, criminal justice reform, and free market prosperity continue onward to the next generation.
Please send your support today. Help me continue to keep liberty alive and reach voters before the election.

Jo Jorgensen 2020
Alex,
Donald Trump and Joe Biden are NOT happy with me.
As you may know, I am on all 50 state ballots! Now, our campaign is the only major challenge to the corrupt two party system.
Our campaign has become their worst nightmare.
Trump and Biden's teams are afraid. They know if our message gets out to voters the American people will stop choosing the lesser of two evils.
But I have a plan get our message out. Here's where I am counting on your help.
September 30th at midnight marks the end of the 3rd FEC quarter. My team crunched the numbers. Here's where we stand.
I must raise an additional $300,000 before the FEC deadline to keep our momentum.
Alex, can you make a donation of $5, $20.20, $50, or more today? Click here to donate >>
The FEC deadline is an important indicator of our campaign's overall support. Trump and Biden's advisors will be watching closely. Let's give them something to worry about!
I am fighting for something greater than holding power. In fact, I want to give power back to the American people.
If elected President, I will...
* Work to end drug prohibition, no-knock raids, and asset forfeiture.
* Cut $1 TRILLION in military spending.
* Provide real, free market-based solutions to rising healthcare costs.
* Restore a limited, Constitutional Republic.
This is the message behind OUR movement. This is what Trump and Biden are afraid of. This is what we need to get out to the American people.
Now is the time to give, Alex. Let's show the D.C. elite a powerful and overwhelming fundraising report, demonstrating a strong campaign force before the FEC deadline on September 30th.

Jo Jorgensen,jo_jorgensen@jo20.com,One of my favorite Ron Paul quotes + update on our goal,"You and I are fighting for the cause of liberty and we are waking people up. What has the two-party system done for us?
Jo Jorgensen 2020
Alex, when Ron Paul ran for President in 2012, 2008, and 1988 (as a Libertarian) he inspired thousands of voters to shed their identity as a Democrat or Republican and to start fighting for liberty.
This is one of my favorite Ron Paul quotes:
""But let it not be said that we did nothing. Let not those who love the power of the welfare/warfare state label the dissenters of authoritarianism as unpatriotic or uncaring.
Patriotism is more closely linked to dissent than it is to conformity and a blind desire for safety and security.
Understanding the magnificent rewards of a free society makes us unbashful in its promotion, fully realizing that maximum wealth is created and the greatest chance for peace comes from a society respectful of individual liberty.” - Dr. Ron Paul
Dr. Paul captures the spirit of America in this statement. Rebellion, independence, and free-thinking are cornerstones of our country's history and make up the character of many in our movement.
I agree with Dr. Paul... let it not be said we did nothing!
You and I are fighting for the cause of liberty and we are waking people up. What has the two-party system done for us?
It's produced candidates like Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Candidates who will continue to spend us into bankruptcy, feed the war machine, make access to healthcare impossible, and saddle us with debts we can never possibly repay.
We are offering a new solution:
* Lower taxes
* Free market healthcare reforms
* Bringing the troops home and FINALLY giving peace a chance
* Defending the Second Amendment
* Auditing the Federal Reserve
* Enacting REAL criminal justice reform
Alex, I need your help getting our message to the American people. Our goal is to raise $50,000 today and we only have roughly $6,800 left! It is ESSENTIAL we meet this goal before the midnight deadline.

Please consider sending an urgent donation of $20.20 or more and join Justin Amash in supporting Jo Jorgensen >>
From Justin Amash:
We know these are unprecedented times. And not just because of COVID-19.
The old parties are running two of the weakest Presidential candidates this country has ever seen.
Donald Trump knows little and cares even less about our system of government. And his dysfunctional administration continues to turn off Republicans and conservatives.
Joe Biden, meanwhile, is an establishment politicians with backward policies who cannot connect with young people or progressives.
Both are awful on criminal justice, civil asset forfeiture, surveillance, spending, wars, the Second Amendment. And I could go on and on. The only thing either one has going for him is that he's not the other guy.
The only thing propping them up is hyper-partisanship fueled by the two old parties and their media allies.
Jo Jorgensen is the only Presidential candidate this cycle committed to both...
* Balancing the Federal budget AND bringing home the troops;
* Cutting burdensome regulations AND ending corporate welfare;
* Expanding free markets AND fixing our criminal justice system;
* Ending unconstitutional surveillance AND ending qualified immunity;.
* And protecting everyone's rights, ALL rights, both enumerated and unenumerated.
This is what Americans want.
Alex, like Justin Amash said, Jo does not have the corporate media on her side. She has hardworking Americans who are dedicated to justice, the Constitution, and liberty.
Can you make a donation today? Jo is looking for 500 donors to chip in before midnight.

## The Unassailable Truths of Liberty
by Mark Johnson
blue_liberty
Why are the truths of liberty unassailable? They are firmly rooted, deep in our souls. They cannot be contested and therefore do not need to be changed. They are also recognized by lovers of liberty, even when they are presented for the first time.
I reflected recently upon the presidential campaign of 1980. I was 16 years old—not yet old enough to vote—yet I clearly remember being captivated by the Ed Clark for President television advertisements. This was my first exposure to the Libertarian Party, and I was profoundly attracted to the truths of liberty that were explained in those messages.
In my senior year of high school, 1981-1982, the ladies from the League of Women Voters (LWV) came to our campus to register students to vote. I was sure to take advantage of the opportunity. Everything was recorded on paper back then, and a lady from the LWV started asking me questions and recording my answers: name, date of birth, address, etc. When she got to the box for ‘party’, her question was “Republican or Democrat?” to which I responded, “Libertarian.” Her response was a blank stare; she simply didn’t know what to do. She proceeded to ask some of the other LWV representatives, and finally one knew the answer. I’ve been resistant to being restricted to two choices ever since that initial experience.
Ed Clark spoke of people, not government, knowing what is best for them. People can solve problems in an “intelligent, benevolent, and voluntary manner.” His goal, and the Libertarian Party’s goal, in 1980 was liberty and curtailing government’s involvement in our lives. That flame was ignited in me then, and it again burns strong in me with the opportunity to elect Jo Jorgensen and Spike Cohen, who embody these principles, these truths which are, after 40 years, still unchanged. There has been one important change, though: we need to act on these truths more than ever.
## Exponential Growth
by Joey Marra
Did you know…
7.5 million more people voted in the 2016 presidential election than in the 2012 election. That’s nearly a 6% increase!
With 7.5 million more votes, the R and D parties saw a combined overall increase of roughly 1.9 million votes, while the Libertarian party saw an overall increase of OVER 3.2 MILLION VOTES – nearly half of the added votes!
Put another way, from 2012 to 2016, the R and D parties experienced a less than 2% increase in their combined support at the polls. The Libertarian party experienced a 252% increase in their support at the polls. 252%!
By supporting Dr. Jo Jorgensen, you aren’t wasting your vote like the old parties would have you believe. Instead, in this political tug-of-war, you are deciding to stop pulling for the status quo and join the massively growing group pulling against it on the other side. Pulling for something better.
The momentum is undeniable. YOU can be a part of the growth that ultimately leads to better candidates, better choices, and better lives. The longer we wait, the worse things get in the meantime. Millions are figuring that out and supporting change in our lifetime. Are you next?

## Debate #1 Recap
If you thought there was no winner in the debate this week - think again. Half way through the first presidential debate, the [[URL REDACTED]] website crashed due to so much activity! Our Social Media team reported that our website experienced a 702% increase in new user traffic during the debates. Social media traffic was up by 1276%. These numbers have helped highlight that our efforts to show the nation Jo belonged on that stage worked. We also received a record amount of donations during the 2 hours the debate was airing! We are upgrading our website. Now is the time to convince your community to upgrade their candidate!

## Remembering Ryan
By Liz Solomon
Screen Shot 2020-10-01 at 9.06.12 AM
One of our numbers passed away this past week on September 25, 2020 -- Ryan Davin of Orange County, CA. He was 31 years old. Ryan was an optimist and believed strongly that Libertarians will make the world a better place. Ryan's selfless efforts and volunteer contributions were greatly appreciated.
Ryan will be missed by many. Flowers were sent on behalf of the campaign. If you would like to make a contribution, an account to help pay for the funeral expenses is linked below: [[URL REDACTED]]
Here is his obituary: [[URL REDACTED]]
“Ryan was very active with the OC for Jorgensen's team. He helped organize the local #LetHerSpeak protest, was helping with our social media efforts, and was helping us contact potential volunteers in Orange County.
“Ryan was a very kind and positive person to work with—and very driven to spread the word about Jo Jorgensen for President. We were concerned when he told us that he wasn't feeling well and shocked when we heard that he had passed away. Ryan was an extremely passionate advocate for liberty and he will be missed by all of us.”
~ David Naranjo, Chair, Libertarian Party of Orange County & County Coordinator, OC for Jorgensen
""Although I did not know Ryan long, what I do remember from the times we met was that his energy was very up lifting. He was a joy to be around and made me feel like I was in the presence of a friend that I had known forever. I'm honored to have met him and have had the chance to fight for liberty alongside him.""
~Nicholas Wildstar, Former Libertarian Candidate for Governor.

## Giant Money Meteor 2020
by Kevin Moore
When: Starting on Wednesday October 7
What: A fundraising drive help fund media and voter outreach through Election Day
Who: Any volunteers who want to help!
Meteor
We need volunteers to help be cheerleaders for this activity in each state. (Or one leader can help cover multiple small states.) They’ll work with the volunteers in your state and existing Phone and Text Banking and Social Media teams to help spread the word to our volunteers.
* This is a grassroots fundraising campaign. We’re looking for our volunteers to reach out to friends and people outside of the usual Libertarian circles and ask for donations to support getting Jo Jorgensen’s message out to voters.
* We’ll provide a variety of materials for fundraisers to use in seeking donations for texting, emails, posts, and even letters or fliers. People won’t have to write their own materials!
* Donations should be directed through the usual channels – the [[URL REDACTED]] website or your respective states’ Anedot donation pages.
* We’ll be keeping track of which state is doing best! The fundraising goals for each state were set primarily based on each state’s population, with an adjustment based on the strength of each state’s Libertarian registration and party membership.
* Watch for daily updates on how your state is doing against the goals. It’s a competition - we’ll have some (non-financial) prizes (we’re working out the details).
* This campaign kicks off on Wednesday 10/7 and is scheduled to run for 9 days.
We have daily calls for the state leaders to learn more – please feel free to share these with anyone who wants to join us!

Jo Jorgensen,jo_jorgensen@jo20.com,"Here's what I think about Kamala Harris - Joe Biden just made a
 fatal campaign mistake","Alex, I hope you can take a moment to read the entire email and respond today.
Alex, Joe Biden is making the worst mistake of his Presidential campaign today.
Kamala Harris is officially his selection for Vice President.
Her 28 year long career as an Attorney General and prosecutor in the state of California is a COMPLETE miscarriage of justice.
* Kamala Harris helped put THOUSANDS of men and women in jail for pot related charges... and proceeded to laugh about smoking marijuana on a podcast during her failed campaign.
* After being ordered to release inmates by the Supreme Court, Harris used her position as Attorney General to prevent inmates from being paroled so she could use them for cheap labor... including using them to fight forest fires.
* Harris has also demonstrated her willingness to use ""third strike laws"" in order to extend unfair prison sentences.
While millions of Americans are crying out for criminal justice reform, Joe Biden has selected a running mate with an abysmal record of fighting for justice and working people.
Biden, an architect of the War on Drugs with a known history of racial ""gaffes"" or ""media mistakes,” has demonstrated a TOTAL disregard for those in his base demanding criminal justice reform.
I WILL NOT LET BIDEN NOR KAMALA HARRIS ESCAPE THEIR RECORD OF TRAGIC INJUSTICES AGAINST MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
Biden is LYING to the American people and to millions of Democrats who are counting on him to enact REAL change.
Alex, to put it bluntly, I am angry.
There is a fire in my belly and I want to shout it from the rooftops, ""Joe Biden is lying to you about criminal justice reform!""
Let's fight back.
I am asking all of my supporters to use this opportunity to teach millions of Americans the truth about Biden and Harris' record on criminal justice and let them know they should vote for OUR campaign in November.
Please take action.

Please don't waste this opportunity.

Jo Jorgensen 2020
Alex, I want to share my thoughts on the Presidential Debate with you...
* America is experiencing the dire consequences of a failed two-party system. The so-called ""debate"" between Trump and Biden was a national embarrassment. The need for a third party candidate has never been greater.
* Trump and Biden, while they talk over each other and bicker, actually agree on far too much. Endless wars, the war on drugs, crony capitalism, and the destruction of our Bill of Rights.
* Neither of these men understand the devastating effect they've had on the United States. Trump has started a trade war that's destroyed millions of jobs and left America with a new record debt. And Joe Biden has ""served"" in public office for 19% of our country's entire history and was an architect of the war on drugs and was a cheerleader for the Iraq War.
It's no wonder they did everything in their power to keep me out of the debate: I would have crushed them with the hard facts, defending the Constitution, and exposed these two for the corrupt politicians they are.
Alex, you and I have a responsibility to spread our message of liberty and provide the American people with a third option. We CANNOT let either Trump or Biden drive our country and our economy into the ground unchallenged.
Let's fight back.
Let's show the American people that LIBERTY can solve our problems, NOT big government.

The establishment forces want to keep Jo Jorgensen out of the debates.
Trump and Biden both agree on many issues, and in particular, they agree Jo is the worst thing for their campaigns if voters find out about her.
Jo will END the wars overseas.
Jo will stop the mass incarceration from the war on drugs.
Jo will provide free market solutions to lower the skyrocketing cost of healthcare in our country.
These are all things the establishment does not want to happen because their special interests profit off the corruption.
We must get Jo out in front of more voters this week. Which is why we are emailing you with an urgent request to donate. Can you become a first-time donor today by chipping in $5 or more?

Here are my post debate thoughts on Trump and Biden:
Alex -- Watching President Trump and Joe Biden ""debate"" each other is mind numbing... but I do want to share my thoughts on what was discussed this evening.
Before I share my thoughts - During the last debate our campaign raised over $100,000 in 24 hours and EXPLODED with new supporters. Can we do it again? Please click here to donate $20.20, $50, $100, $250 or any amount.
The economy, lockdowns, and COVID19:
Biden is doing everything he can to place the blame on President Trump. In turn, Trump is attempting to blame Biden and the Democrats for destroying the economy by forcing businesses to shut down.
The reality?
These lockdowns have been a bipartisan disaster.
We have lost THOUSANDS of businesses and MILLIONS for jobs because of the actions taken by politicians willing to tear up the Constitution during a crisis.
As President, I would re-open our economy and unleash the free market to create solutions for viruses such as COVID19.
Foreign governments and backroom deals:
I can't pretend to know all the details of the back room deals President Trump and Joe Biden make.
However, I do know these men have a history of making shady deals and are well connected with the global elite.
I don't trust either of them with our economy, taxpayer money, or to act ethically in the White House.
Healthcare:
We will NEVER achieve victory on healthcare reform until we adopt free market solutions. We can dramatically reduce the cost of healthcare by reducing regulations, FULLY repealing Obamacare, and embracing innovation.
Criminal Justice Reform:
Neither of these men are qualified to speak about criminal justice reform. Biden enacted the 1994 crime bill and Trump has DONE nothing to end the War on Drugs.
As President, I would pardon non-violent drug offenders, seek to end qualified immunity, and stop arming police departments with weapons from the Pentagon.
Climate Change:
I am the only candidate proposing a solution that will cut our CO2 gas emissions rapidly... nuclear power.
We need to unleash the free market to solve environmental issues. Not the government!
Post Debate Call-To-Action:
During the last debate, our website traffic blew up, Google searches for our campaign reached record highs, voter pledges flooded in, and new donors. We even raised over $100,000 in 24 hours.
Americans are searching for another candidate to vote for. We MUST reach them during this critical window of opportunity and earn their vote.

* Pardoning non-violent drug war victims
* Putting an end to the Federal Reserve's money printing schemes

Remember what we are fighting for.
* Ending the war on drugs
* Ending the foreign wars in the Middle East
* Bringing economic liberty and prosperity to Americans
* Defending our rights.
Biden isn't going to defend your rights and Trump isn't going to let go of the corporate socialism plaguing our economy.
Do you want to know what your contribution can accomplish? Here are a few numbers for you to consider.
* Our ads on Facebook can achieve a ""CPM"" (cost per 1,000 impressions) between $3-$10 depending upon the ad we are serving. This means a $100 donation can help us serve between 10,000-35,000 impressions!
* Do you know how much it costs to fill the campaign bus with gas? You'd be surprised it only costs between $150 - $200! Your donation helps Jo and Spike travel the country to meet new voters and earn media attention.
* A donation of $10 or $20.20 helps to pay for the campaign literature we distribute, bumper stickers, yard signs, credits for our phone banking operation, and so much more.
As you can see, your donation has a REAL impact on this campaign.

If everyone chipped in just $5, then we would easily crush this goal and make a powerful statement about stopping the two-party system.
Here are more numbers for you to think about:
* 4,592 supporters have stepped up and committed to a monthly donation to support Jo!
* At the time of writing this email, 10,580 contributions have been made to our campaign in the month of August.
* The average contribution size is $32.80!
Alex, there is an army of grassroots supporters contributing to our movement. However, we must continue to grow this army of supporters to take down the two-party system.
We're counting on your help this month. Please let us know if you can contribute before the August 31st midnight deadline!

Jo Jorgensen 2020
Alex, do you remember the scene in Lord of the Rings: Two Towers with Sam and Frodo near the end of the movie?
Don't worry - If you haven't seen it I won't provide any spoilers.
Frodo is desperate and his mission seems nearly impossible to complete. Defeating Sauron, or the two-party system for that matter, isn't an easy battle. Here's a quick excerpt:
Sam: ""... Folks in those stories had lots of chances in turning back only they didn't. They kept going because they were holding onto to something.""
Frodo: ""What are we holding onto, Sam?""
Sam: ""That there's some good left in this world, Mr. Frodo, and it's worth fighting for.""
As Sam said, those committed to victory never turned back and were fighting for something bigger than themselves.
Alex, you and I are holding on to something too. We're holding on to our Second Amendment rights, civil liberties, free markets, a foreign policy of peace, real healthcare reform, and transforming our criminal justice system.
This is what we're fighting for.
And yes... together we are casting the ring of power into the fire.
We can't back down now.
Donald Trump and Joe Biden are crossing their fingers and hoping we will give up or simply concede... I refuse to do so.
Our fight is important and one I believe in. However, our fight for liberty requires funding and I need your help. My goal is to raise an additional $300,000 before the end of the month so we can reach millions of voters DURING the debates. Please use one of these links to donate today.

We are rapidly approaching the election and there's no time to wait. I am counting on your help to achieve this $300,000 goal. We can provide Americans with a REAL choice this election they can be proud of.
America voting for the lesser of two evils isn't working.
Voters are joining our campaign in droves when they hear our message.
However, America will never hear our message of liberty if we fail to raise the funds needed to reach them online, over the radio, on TV, via streaming services, etc.
This is our moment.
We must strike NOW.

## DEBATABLE RULES
by Jennifer Imhoff
debate_100dpi
The first 2020 presidential debate is tonight, September 29, 2020, at 9:15 EDT. It is no surprise that our candidate, Dr. Jo Jorgensen, is not included. We, the voters, are here, however, and we will be listening.
Earlier this year the Appeals Court refused to hear the lawsuit brought forward by the nonprofit group, Level the Playing Field. Support came from the Libertarian and Green parties to sue the Federal Election Commission after the commission rejected the parties’ objections to the criteria of the Commission on Presidential Debates. The court documents state that, “There is no legal requirement that the commission make it easier for independent candidates to run for president of the United States.”
The commission requires a candidate to obtain a minimum of 15% in five pre-selected national polls. However, it is no coincidence that the polls selected excluded the names of candidates from third parties, even though the Libertarian candidate, Dr. Jo Jorgensen, met ballot access requirements in all 50 states.

## No “Wasted” Votes in Maine
by Mark Johnson of Frenchville, ME
Maine is a wonderful place to live: beautiful mountains, lush forests, scenic coastline, friendly people . . . and ranked-choice voting! Libertarians know that the only “wasted vote” is for more of the same, but ranked-choice voting makes the concept of the wasted vote disappear.
In Maine, we now don’t simply vote. We rank order our choices for each elected position. Therefore, those who really are encouraged by Dr. Jo’s message, but are discouraged that they might not get their lesser-of-two-evils choice by voting for Dr. Jo, no longer need to be concerned.
Here’s a quick summary of how this works. There are five candidates on Maine’s presidential election ballot: Biden, de la Fuente, Hawkins, Jorgensen, Trump. Everyone who supports Dr. Jo can “rank” her #1. If my preferred lesser-of-two evils candidate is Biden, I just need to be sure I rank him higher than Trump, or vice versa, and if Hawkins, de la Fuente, and Jorgensen all get eliminated, one by one, by finishing last in each of the first three rounds, my vote would still go to my preferred lesser-of-two-evils candidate.
Let’s look at some scenarios. For these scenarios, let’s assume that 43% of Maine voters favor Jorgensen, but because they’ve been conditioned by a two-party system, only 28% of Maine voters would have voted for her under traditional balloting. In a five-way race under traditional balloting, 43% should be enough to win, but 28% would not be enough. Of the 15% who would not have voted for Jorgensen, let’s say that 80% of those, or 12% of the entire electorate, favor Trump.
Scenario 1:
* The 43% who favor Jorgensen rank her #1.
* The other first place rankings are as follows: Trump 27%, Biden 22%, de la Fuente 6%, Hawkins 2%.
* Those who ranked Hawkins first all ranked Biden as their second choice.
* After the first tally, no one has 50% of the vote, so the candidate with the fewest first-place rankings, Hawkins, is eliminated, and those votes now go to Biden. So we now have: Jorgensen 43%, Trump 27%, Biden 24%, de la Fuente 6%.
* Still, no one has 50% of the vote, so de la Fuente is eliminated. Those who ranked him first split their second place votes between Jorgensen and Trump, each receiving 3%. The tally is now Jorgensen 46%, Trump 30%, Biden 24%.
* Still, no one has 50% of the note, so Biden is eliminated. Those who ranked him first all ranked Hawkins as their second choice, but Hawkins has been eliminated, so their third-ranked choices are evaluated. Of those, three-fourths chose Trump and the remainder chose Jorgensen, so Trump gets another 18% (three-fourths of 24%) and Jorgensen gets 6%.
* Jorgensen now has 52% and Trump has 48%. Jorgensen exceeds 50% and wins!
Scenario 2:
* Only the 28% portion of those who truly favor Jorgensen rank her #1. The rest rank Trump #1.
* Keeping the rest of the candidates’ rankings the same, the first tally is now Trump 42%, Jorgensen 28%, Biden 22%, de la Fuente 6%, Hawkins 2%.
* All those who ranked Trump and de la Fuente first ranked Jorgensen second. All those who ranked Hawkins first ranked Biden second.
* After the first tally, Hawkins is eliminated, and the new totals are Trump 42%, Jorgensen 28%, Biden 24%, de la Fuente 6%.
* After the second tally, de la Fuente is eliminated, and with those second place rankings split between Trump and Jorgensen, the new totals are Trump 45%, Jorgensen 31%, Biden 24%.
* Biden is now eliminated. Following the rankings above of those who ranked Biden first, Trump gets 18% and Jorgensen gets 6%.
* Trump how has 63% and Jorgensen has 37%. Trump exceeds 50% and wins.
While I’ve done my best to provide some simplified scenarios, the process is still complex due to the possible permutations, made even more complex by voters who may only make one or two choices. That said, there are two takeaways that are amazingly simple: Getting voters to rank Jorgensen first and either Biden or Trump second, rather than the other way around, has a profound effect on the final outcome. If the liberty-loving voters of Maine rank Jorgensen, and not the lesser of two evils, as their first choice, she would coast to victory!
## An Interesting History of Presidential Debates
By Joey Marra
1972
A new FCC ruling extends “equal time” provisions to presidential debates. As a matter of practicality, this largely necessitates presidential debates be hosted by a neutral third-party.
1976
The nonpartisan League of Women Voters (LWV) steps in to be that neutral party and to ultimately host the first televised presidential debate in nearly twenty years. They go on to host debates through 1984 with the goal of informing the American voter via a nonpartisan platform utilizing lively debate formats and inclusion of third-party and independent candidates.
1980
In opposition to their inclusion of an independent candidate, President Carter declines the LWV’s invitation to the second debate of the year. Despite the lack of appearance by the sitting president, true to its principles, the LWV goes on with the debate, honoring their invitations to Ronald Reagan and independent candidate, John Anderson. Jimmy Carter goes on to lose the election to Ronald Reagan, with Carter’s absence at the debate noted as a major factor in Reagan’s success. The Democratic and Republican parties get their first taste of the influence of the relatively new, neutrally hosted, televised debates. It is also apparent that the presence of an independent candidate is what kept the debate alive, even when a sitting president chose to opt out. Simply declining to participate is not a viable option.
1984
The Democratic and Republican parties begin to work together to remove risk from the LWV’s debates by jointly vetoing nearly 100 panelists proposed by the LWV for the ‘84 debates.
1987
The non-profit Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) is formed with the intent of taking control of the presidential debates. It is formed by the two heads of the Democratic and Republican parties, chaired by those same two men, and is staffed by members of both parties. At the time, one of the founders stated that the new CPD was not likely to look with favor on including third-party candidates in the debates, while the other stated plainly that the panel should exclude them. Despite its formation, founding members, staffing, and the statements of its founders, the CPD describes itself as “nonpartisan” to this day.
1988
In an attempt to wrangle control from the LWV, the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns meet without the knowledge of the LWV to draft a “memorandum of understanding” outlining their requirements for participation in the 1988 debates. This document removes all control from the LWV. It specifies who would be panelists, who could sit in the audience, removed follow-up questions from the format, and more. It is presented to the LWV as “take it or leave it.” The LWV loudly “leaves it,” stating that “the demands of the two campaign organizations would perpetrate a fraud on the American voter.” Upon resignation of the LWV, the months-old D&R-formed CPD steps in to take over the debates as their “nonpartisan” sponsor and host.
1992
Ross Perot, then polling at 7%, is included in the CPD’s debates. After what is largely considered impressive debate performances, Ross Perot goes on to receive 19% of the popular vote on election day. This is considered to be a remarkable achievement and the largest post-debate increase ever seen.
1996
Although in the running again and on the ballot in all 50 states, the CPD does not invite Ross Perot to the 1996 debates.
2000
The CPD establishes a rule that, in order to be included in the debates, a candidate must achieve an average of 15% in five national polls. Although sounding somewhat reasonable on the surface, there are major criticisms of this rule: (1) The CPD alone chooses which polls will be used each election cycle. (2) The polls are routinely chosen only after they have published their polling results. (3) Nearly all polls used do not mention the names of any candidates other than those of the Democratic and Republican parties. That is, in order to meet the CPD’s criteria, a third-party candidate must average 15% in polls where their name is not even mentioned and where the CPD already knows the results.
1996 – 2020
Despite multiple candidates appearing on the ballots in all 50 states, no third-party nor independent candidates are invited to a CPD debate. Ross Perot’s appearance in 1992 is the last.
Multiple lawsuits are brought against the CPD for various reasons including violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act, violation of Federal Antitrust Laws, and challenges to its non-profit status. Thus far, none of these lawsuits have been successful.
Today
We’ve been cheated. For over three decades, the Democratic and Republican parties have effectively worked together to limit the choices of the American voter while failing to work together in Congress on issues such as the national debt, our nation’s security, and much more. They are showing us where their priorities lie.
Not only are they actively silencing the voices of viable candidates and stifling the competition of ideas that benefits us all regardless of political affiliation, they also continue to perpetuate the lie that voting outside of their chosen candidates is a “wasted vote.” This implies that prioritizing your values and supporting a candidate that you feel could better help the nation is somehow a waste. Just like the curated debates, this is simply another dishonest campaign tool with the goal of concentrating attention and support where actively funnel it. Those of us disappointed and disenfranchised by the Democrats and Republicans make up the VAST MAJORITY of voters – mathematically, the two parties simply can’t beat the numbers, so instead they deceive and mislead. Or, as the LWV warned us decades ago, they knowingly “perpetrate a fraud on the American voter.”
Thirty years later, it’s the same as it ever was. Despite the majority of Americans routinely expressing the need for more party options, despite more and more Americans not identifying as either Republican or Democrat, despite being on the ballot in all 50 states, and despite the majority of Americans agreeing with 60-70% of her platform, Libertarian candidate Dr. Jo Jorgensen is not named in any of the five polls chosen by the CPD for debate inclusion and has not been invited to the CPD’s 2020 presidential debates.
YOU can do the work, though. YOU don’t have to approach this election wearing the blinders that the old parties have handed you. Research Dr. Jorgensen. Read her platform. Watch her videos. See if her ideas resonate with you; then talk to your friends and family and let them know that there is a better way. We all deserve better. Demand better. Be part of the growing momentum that ultimately rids us of the ever-worsening status quo and leads us to better candidates, better choices, and better lives.

## What Is A Media Monitor?
by Chelsea K. Meckel, M.A.
Over the past few years the Libertarian Party has had more than its fair share of gaffes, and it seems like when those happen it is one of the few times the media decides to unite and put us in the spotlight. In 2016, journalists from the Washington Times to the BBC in the United Kingdom covered Gary Johnson’s famous “What’s Aleppo?” moment. Thankfully, we Libertarians are capable of learning from our mistakes, and the Media Monitoring Team with the Jo Jorgensen for United States President is busy monitoring both Dr. Jorgensen’s presence in the media, as well as working hard to keep her up-to-date with any current events both here in America, and around the world.
The Media Monitoring team is broken down into two parts. First, there is a group of volunteers working hard to keep up with Dr. Jorgensen’s presence in the media. Above all, campaigns are acts of communication, and the first step in any successful communication attempt is to understand your audience. On this team, members of the audience go through and pull quotes, videos, and audio they think help present Dr. Jorgensen in a favorable light. These are then used in promotional materials by the campaign. Understanding that not all communication is good communication, this team also checks for possible faux pas where Dr. Jorgensen could have possibly used better communication strategies to reach her audience.
The other part of the Media Monitoring team focuses on keeping Dr. Jorgensen up-to-date with current events. Candidates are busy, and do not always have the time in their busy schedule to read through dozens of news articles to see what is happening in both America and around the world. That is where this team comes in. Every day volunteers review a variety of newspapers to see what the people from both sides of the political divide find important. This way, Dr. Jorgensen is prepared to address these needs in her constituency on the campaign trail.
With the Media Monitoring on the lookout, hopefully Dr. Jorgensen can be not only an excellent representation of the Libertarian Party, but hopefully by keeping her up-to-date on current events, we can avoid another “What’s Aleppo?” moment and have one of the most informed candidates on the stage to present to the American people. Since Libertarians are one of the lesser known political parties, even though we have achieved ballot access for Dr. Jorgensen in all 50 states, we seem to be held to higher standards than the other candidates from the major parties. We have got to do more to win people’s votes. Therefore, it is important to present an informed, intelligent candidate, with excellent communication skills to head our ticket.

Jo Jorgensen 2020
Alex,
As I'm sure you realize we are rapidly approaching the election and it's officially crunch time when it comes to turning out our voters, persuading undecided voters, and amplifying our message on social media and other ad platforms.
We have a real opportunity to present the ideas of liberty to the American people in 2020.
Joe Biden and Donald Trump are awful candidates and very few people are excited about actually casting their vote for either of them.
Let's seize this opportunity.
I am trying to raise AT LEAST an additional $100,000 before my October 14th FEC deadline (the FEC has a ""Pre-General Election"" filing) in order to fund CRITICAL voter outreach efforts on social media, streaming services, phone calls, and texting.
Our campaign team came up with a unique idea I think may help inspire you to donate.
Anyone who gives $250 or more before October 14th, will receive a personally signed Constitution!
Here are donation links you can use to make a time sensitive donation before our October 14th deadline:
Donate $20.20 >>>
Donate $50 >>>
Donate $100 >>>
Donate $250 >>>
Donate $500 >>>
Donate $1,000 >>>
Donate Any Amount >>>
I hope you will consider donating ANY amount before our October 14th FEC deadline. Our campaign is funded by thousands of supporters donating $10, $20.20, or $100 at a time.
Can I count on your support?
Please reply, ""Done!"" if you make a donation!
Thank you so much, Alex.

Team Jo,jo_jorgensen@jo20.com,6 Reasons why Jo is better than Trump and Biden,"Do you disagree, Alex?
Jo20-Logo
Alex --
Trump and Biden want to silence Jo, because when it comes to the issues that truly matter, they are more identical than the media would like to admit.
Here are 6 ways Jo is radically different than Trump and Biden.
1\. War and peace
Both Trump and Biden are part of the military-industrial complex.
Trump has failed to keep his promise of an America First foreign policy. Biden has all of Bush's cronies supporting him. The same cronies who gave us the wars in the Middle East.
Jo believes in the same foreign policy as our Founding Fathers - neutrality and no entangling alliances.
Alex, if you believe voters need to hear this issue during the debate, then please donate to Jo Jorgensen today. Click here to give $5 or more >>
2\. Criminal justice reform
Both Trump and Biden are demonstrating a total lack of will and courage to enact any meaningful criminal justice reform.
Trump doesn't have the political will to bring about serious changes and Biden chose ""top cop"" Kamala Harris as his VP. As a Senator, he passed legislation that currently plagues our country with over-populated prisons.
Jo believes in ending qualified immunity, ending no-knock raids, and ending the war on drugs.
Let's end the war on drugs for good. Help Jo spread this message by donating $5, $25, $50, or even $100 today >>
3\. The Constitution
Both Trump and Biden have shown little to no interest in the Constitution. In all the hours of their speeches, it's barely mentioned. Do not believe these politicians will protect the liberties enshrined.
Jo will take her Oath of Office seriously and protect our liberties from all enemies - foreign and domestic.
Our Constitutional Republic is barely surviving. Help Jo give voters a real choice in November by donating here >>
4\. Surveillance
Both Trump and Biden support the deep state's surveillance on the American people via the NSA and various government agencies.
Jo will pardon Snowden and end mass surveillance of the American people.
Can you donate $5, $20.20, $50, or more and help Jo bring this issue to the forefront of the election?
5\. Government spending & debt
Both Trump and Biden will continue to grow the government.
Republicans don't even pretend to care anymore about the outrageous spending under Trump. The debt has ballooned under Trump and $6 TRILLION was added just this year. Biden's programs will guarantee more spending in the future.
Jo will eliminate deficit spending by shrinking the size of government.
Alex, we can't let them spend away our future. Donate $5, $20.20 or more to Jo and help us defeat two-parties >>
6\. Corruption
Both Trump and Biden represent the special interest that corrupt our politicians and plague D.C.
Despite Trump's call to drain the swamp, he has simply become one of the swamp's disgusting creatures. Meanwhile, Joe Biden has lived in the swamp for decades and will continue to fight for the status quo and dole out favors to the well-connected.
Jo is a true outsider who will be government control back to the people and away from the corporate lobbyists.
Let's not settle for the status quo any longer, Alex.
We will not let them silence our voices and keep Jo away from voters. Each dollar raised will help us reach 11 new voters with our new video.
Please help Jo raise $5,000 in the next 24 hours to bring these issues to the forefront of the election. Select an amount below to give.

Dr. Jo Jorgensen,jo_jorgensen@jo20.com,Official Ballot Access Update,"Our fight against the corrupt two-headed monster is escalating. There are two ways you can help.
Jo20-Logo
Alex,
Our fight against the corrupt two-headed monster (the two-party system) is escalating.
Here is the official update on our fight for ballot access:
These are the states we have left to lock in ballot access: Maine, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arkansas, New Hampshire, Iowa, Minnesota, Alabama, Virginia, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Minnesota.
Alex, we are facing an unprecedented ballot access fight that no other Libertarian candidate has had to deal with.
Many of these states have SHUTDOWN public spaces, are forcing people to stay indoors, and making it difficult to collect the signatures needed to secure ballot access.
The establishment is using the COVID19 crisis to keep our campaign off of the ballot.
I am REFUSING to let them get away with this.
I am deploying paid petitioners and running online ads to collect signatures in these KEY states. Please click here to donate $5, $20.20, $50, $100 or more to secure ballot access in all 50 states >>
Donate $5
Donate $20.20
Donate $50
Donate $100
Donate $250
Donate $500
Donate Any Amount
Alex, my team's records indicate that you have yet to contribute. Time is running out for us to get on the ballot in these critical states. Now is the best time to give.
The fight against the establishment is ramping up and I'm worried I will not reach our goal of $500,000 before the end of the month.
I don't want to alarm you, but Trump and Biden are expected to raise millions! Voters deserve another choice. Our future depends on another choice.
If we do not make it on the ballot, then many voters will be left without a real option.
Please make your first time donation today by clicking here.
I know with your support we can take down the corrupt establishment that controls our nation.
Thank you!
Dr. Jo Jorgensen
P.S. I cannot stress how important this call-to-action is to our campaign. We CANNOT lose this fight. Please click here to make the most generous donation you can make today.

Beginning October 1, 2020, Facebook will begin enforcing a stricter community standard guideline in an attempt to “stop hate speech.”
These changes are expected to impact page and group admins and require heavy oversight and censorship.
If you are an admin on a group or page, be sure to review the new standards and monitor accordingly. Your personal Facebook profile could be canceled if the terms are violated.
We suggest that you delete brazen or baiting comments; do not respond to the comment or let it stay on the page.
Censorship is the opposite of liberty and not something we condone, but Facebook could revoke your personal account, regardless. We do not want your family connections, photos, or memories to be lost at the expense of your good intentions to volunteer for the campaign. We recommend exercising caution.

## Illinois for Jorgensen Page Banned for Sharing Jo Post
Jo Jorgensen’s page safely posted an article regarding millennials’ and Gen Z’s understanding of the Holocaust. The article was originally published by USA Today on the same day, September 16, 2020. When The Illinois for Jorgensen page shared the post and article, the admin for the page was informed that they violated community standards and the page was removed.

I admin the official 'Illinois for Jorgensen/Cohen' page, and Facebook says my resharing of the article was HATE SPEECH that went against community standards.
The article addresses how many Millennials do not know that 6M Jews were murdered. Dr. Jorgensen's comments were posted verbatim, calling out the Department of Education's failures.
Yet Facebook censored the Illinois for Jorgensen/Cohen page and unpublished it.”

## What is Phone Banking?
## An Interview with Ryan Cooper by Liz Solomon
Our volunteers are doing some really cool things! Most of us have heard about “phone banking.” Phone banking has been around for decades; calling volunteers, donors, and voters is nothing new. But, have you heard of “text banking”? I had an opportunity to catch up with Ryan Cooper from Washington this week. He and a group of volunteers are texting for the Jorgensen campaign.
L: Ryan, tell me, what is a “texting” party?
R: A texting party is where a group of us in the same time zone (Pacific) get together on Zoom and chat with each other while we send text messages to voters using the Jorgensen Call Hub platform. We find that it's more fun doing it as a group than individually. We can ask questions, get help using the system, and have a blast while doing it.
L: Was the event virtual or did you meet somewhere in person?
R: We did it virtually for two reasons. One, Covid, and the forest fires. Meeting together is a challenge already. The forest fires on the West Coast make breathing outside difficult. It just makes sense to get together on Zoom and have a virtual Text Bank Party.
L: How long was the event?
R: The event was from 5-8, but people stayed on until 9pm, which is the Call Hub cutoff for sending messages. We encourage everyone to try to tie up loose conversation threads before logging off so that you don't leave anyone hanging.
L: How did you come up with this idea?
R: Ron Paul's campaign did similar texting and phone banking operations in 2008 and 2012. Volunteers would meet up at a nearby Subway. Whoever sent the most messages won a free $5 footlong. Those who couldn't attend could participate over Skype. This is the next evolution in the Ron Paul Revolution.
L: Was the event a success?
R: Huge success. Going into it, you are never sure how many people will show up. We had 15, which is not bad for our first one. Those volunteers sent over 8000 messages, had over 1000 conversations. The Jorgensen campaign added a bunch of new volunteers and raised over $500 just from our efforts.
L: Would you do it again?
R: We are doing it every Tuesday night 5-8:30 PM Pacific. On election night, we are hosting a virtual zoom party for all of our volunteers. Our goal next week is 50 volunteers from across CA, OR, NV, AZ, WA, and Northern Idaho (Pacific Time Zone) and 50,000 sent messages. We are hoping to get Spike and Jo on future West Coast Text Banker Tuesday Zooms.
L: Is there anything you would like to add?
R: West Coast Text Bankers 4 Jorgensen is issuing a ""Time Zone Challenge"" to the Mountain, Central, and Eastern Time Zone Jorgensen supporters. Whichever Time Zone Team has the most volunteers and sends the most text messages on a specific Zoom event evening will win a prize or some kind of recognition. We will be offering some swag and incentives to people who want to join our West Coast Text Banker Team. Our team is open to anyone who wants to text bank Pacific Time Zone voters every Tuesday night 5-8:30 PM Pacific. Apply using this link and mention ""West Coast Text Bankers"": [[URL REDACTED]]
Thank you Ryan Cooper and all of our amazing text bankers!
To all the volunteers who are looking for a way to get involved, please consider joining us! Everyone can use the link above to sign up! If you’re interested in joining one of the time zone teams please mention your respective time zone, e.g., “East Coast Text Bankers”, “Central Text Bankers”, “Mountain Text Bankers.” If you are interested in leading a time zone, be sure to mention that, too! We can’t wait to see you on Zoom!

Media highlights...
Read a Q&A with Jo from her trip to Alaska >>
Listen to Jo on the Ben Shapiro show >>
Read Jo's thoughts about the kind of person she would appoint to the Supreme Court...
While others squabble over which political gang should pick the next Supreme Court justice, I'll tell you the kind of person I would choose. My selection would have two primary qualities...
1. An ability to read, comprehend, and apply simple English
2. The integrity to do what the Constitution actually says, NOT what they wish it said.
The result would be a Justice who protects individual liberty and personal responsibility on all issues at all times. Specifically...
The 9th Amendment protects a general right to liberty. This means we should all be free to do as we choose, provided we don't violate the equal right of others to do the same.
The 10th Amendment limits the federal government to narrow powers and functions.
The 1st Amendment protects an individual right to a freedom-of-the-press, which would render most campaign finance laws instantly illegal.
The 2nd Amendment protects an individual right to keep-and-bear-arms, free from state regulation.
The 4th Amendment protects Americans from warrantless spying and makes no exceptions just because cowardly politicians fear terrorism.
The 'commerce clause' was intended to create a national free-market, NOT a centralized economy controlled by top-down regulatory dictates.
The ""general welfare clause' means that laws must benefit Americans generally. But Supreme Court opinions have fostered a system that serves special interests.
The Constitution provides an amendment process. The Supreme Court has no right to replace that process with judicial fiat. If a need is truly compelling then let it be demonstrated through the amendment process.
Having a Supreme Court that can read, comprehend, and apply simple English would be profound. Most current federal activities would be judged illegal, leaving a government that protects rather than violates our life, liberty, and property.

Alex,
I'm not pulling any punches when it comes to Trump and Biden.
They are both despicable, corrupt, and will serve the establishment's interests over that of the people.
I decided to run on the Libertarian ticket because I could not stand by any longer as our country's finances are treated like a limitless credit card for the powerful. I see our nation crying out for justice and yet all we get are empty platitudes from politicians who have no clue what they are doing.
Jo and I are not running to rule over your lives. We're here to STOP the government from harming our society and empower you to run your own life!
Unfortunately, we face an uphill battle.
Trump and Biden are doing everything in their power to keep Jo and I out of the debates. The Commission on debates is controlled by their cronies. No wonder Jo is being excluded!
Here's how we can get around it.
We can go directly to voters with our videos, mailers, and on our bus tours. We will not be silenced!
Alex, can you please donate $5, $20.20, $50, or more today and help Jo reach new voters with our message of liberty?
I know the campaign has emailed you a lot, but we do not have the privilege of relying on crony capitalists and insiders for our funding. We only have dedicated liberty activists and supporters who truly want change.
This is not easy for me to ask. I'm not used to it frankly. But I know it must be done if we are going to grow the liberty movement and grow the Libertarian Party.
And to be honest, this is bigger than the 2020 election. This is building a movement and fighting for our future.
The future is ours. I do believe our platform resonates with the majority of voters. We have to get our message in front of them.

Alex,
Fundraising is the ugliest part of campaigning. We know we've asked a lot from Jo's supporters and have been BLOWN AWAY by the response.
With Election Day a week away we sometimes get the question from supporters of ""isn't it too late for my donation to make an impact?""
The short answer to that question is easy -- no, your contribution still makes a HUGE impact.
We have run an incredibly efficient campaign, something our team is proud of. But here's what we're up against...
Biden and Trump have raised over $3 billion dollars
(Source: NPR)
That's right. Trump and Biden have raised over $3 billion dollars.
We've combated this huge disadvantage by pinching pennies wherever we can and only committing to highly-targeted ad campaigns.
But Alex, we have to be honest with you. If we're not able to keep pace with our $350,000 Get-Out-The-Vote fundraising goal we will have to cut our efforts short.
This could mean THOUSANDS of voters who won't hear about Jo's message of Free Markets and Free People.

Compare this to Joe Biden (31%) and Donald Trump (49%) and it's easy to tell who the PEOPLE support. (Source: [[URL REDACTED]])
You and I have the opportunity to earn the highest voter turnout for a Libertarian in history! But Jo needs your help to make this possible.
We don't want to scale back these critical last-minute GOTV efforts. That's the reality we're facing if we fail to reach our $350,000 goal.
We are counting on your help. Will you help fund final Get-Out-The-Vote efforts in several key states. Can you click here to donate $5, $20.20, $50, $100, or any amount today?

Alex, you and I have an opportunity to make history on Election Day.
This campaign has built a movement of hardcore believers in the ideas of liberty, free markets, and the Constitution. We've shown the establishment the American people are ready for a new option outside of the failed two-party system.
But our job isn't over yet.
We have the opportunity to earn a historic turnout for a Libertarian candidate and help others running as Libertarians across the country.
I am declaring an Emergency Pre-Election Moneybomb of $50,000 with a 11/3/2020 6:00 ET deadline.
I am raising funds to pay for last-minute persuasion and GOTV efforts as well as funding our poll watching operation to ensure ALL Libertarian votes are counted on Election Day.
Make no mistake -- If there are recounts or contested results, the two-party system will do everything in their power to throw third-party voters under the bus.
I refuse to let this happen.
Please help us reach last-minute voters, fund our poll watching operation, and turn out our supporters by donating ANY amount to our Emergency Pre-Election Moneybomb:
Donate $1,000 >>>
Donate $500 >>>
Donate $250 >>>
Donate $100 >>>
Donate $50 >>>
Donate $20.20 >>>
Donate $5 >>>
Donate Any Amount >>>
Your gift has a major impact on how many of our supporters we are able to turn out to the polls on Election Day.
Turning out voters in key states will have a MAJOR impact on several races in key states for Libertarian candidates.
Let's show Joe Biden and Donald Trump we aren't done fighting!

Our campaign is now on the ballot in all 50 states. Jo is now the only viable option against the establishment duopoly of Trump and Biden. And voters want a 3rd option now more than ever.
However, the usual attacks have begun. The media wants her out of the race. Conservative pundits fear she is a spoiler for Biden. Liberal pundits think she is a spoiler for Trump.
Funny how they don't realize many voters don't want either Trump or Biden!

Jo made headline news in Alaska this week. The Ketchikan Daily News was just one of the many media outlets that covered Jo’s return to the campaign trail and how her platform represents Alaska.
Dr. Jo Jorgensen said the decision to visit Alaska was because of the state’s strong historical support for the party. “It’s on the campaign trail for Libertarians because Alaska is a very libertarian country,” she said.

Hi Alex,
I have some time on the tour to reach out to you and see if we can count on your help.
I'm sure you've heard the big news. We will be on the ballot in all 50 states. Our campaign is now the only viable option for people searching for a real choice outside of the fake Republican-Democrat dichotomy.
In fact, our campaign is bigger than this single election.
I truly believe we are building a movement for liberty that will last into the future. As I tour the country, I am seeing people desperate for another choice.
And when we get a chance to present our ideas to voters, they realize our ideas represent them better than the out-of-touch Democrats and Republicans.
Alex, I am counting on your help. Can you donate $20.20, $50, $100, or any amount you can afford to send? Click here to give >>
Your support will go directly to helping us reach voters with ads, texting, the tour, and campaign events.
Jo is looking to raise $300,000 before next Wednesday. I told her I would personally reach out to you and see if you can help.
I want to raise $10,000 in the next 24 hours. Can I count on your support?

P.S. Remember what you are fighting for, Alex.
This is not about one election cycle, the Libertarian Party, or even Jo herself.
You're fighting for REAL criminal justice reform...
You're righting to bring the troops home and to STOP the bloodshed...
You're fighting for our Second Amendment rights (something Biden and Trump have proven they will not protect)...
You're fighting for free markets! Let's Unleash capitalism to lift millions out of poverty and save our economy...
You're fighting to Audit and ultimately end the Federal Reserve's money-printing machine...

Alex,
Here it is. Election Day.
I'm so proud of how far this campaign has gone in less than six months since I received the Libertarian nomination. I hope you're proud too.
Today, we have the chance to earn the most votes a Libertarian candidate has ever received and it's all thanks to you.
However, I want to make one thing perfectly clear to the Two-Party System:
We're not going anywhere!
Just because the polls close tonight does not mean this campaign is over. We still have the opportunity to make an impact far beyond 2020.
Sadly, it's unlikely the American people will know the result of the election tonight either.
Our campaign is preparing for an unprecedented fight over absentee and mail-in ballots. Trump’s and Biden's campaigns will do anything to toss out your vote during recounts and contested ballot reviews.
We're not going to let that happen!
Libertarian poll watchers across the country are working to make sure every American gets their chance to vote against the broken two-party system.

The election is less than 70 days away and I have to raise $250,000 in the next 5 days before our critical deadline.
Here's where we stand.
* Michelle Obama is demanding that you do not vote for me.
* The corporate media are more corrupt and partisan than ever before, trying to silence our movement.
* And the two-party system continues to show bipartisan support for the wars overseas and being waged on the American people via the war on drugs and our economy.
I believe I've sent you a few emails about becoming a recurring donor but haven't heard back.
I'm reaching out one last time about our recurring donor program. By being a recurring donor, you are making a powerful statement that you're fighting with me to end the war on drugs, end our foreign wars, and bring economic prosperity back to the U.S.

Alex, Jo Jorgensen is on the ballot in your state..
You have the opportunity to cast your vote for Jo in the General Election and demonstrate to the broken two-party system the American people are done suffering from their failures and living under tyranny.
You have the chance to tell Donald Trump, YOU'RE FIRED!
You have the chance to tell Joe Biden simply being ""not Trump"" isn't enough.
We need a candidate with the courage to enact real criminal justice reform, unleash free market capitalism, bring our troops home, respect our Second Amendment rights, and restore our Republic.
So what's next?
Alex, it is not enough to simply be correct.
Yes, enacting liberty and obeying our Constitution solves many of our nation's problems. But that doesn't matter unless patriots stand up and fight for these ideas.

Alex,
The zombies are coming for you!
They want to destroy your liberties through government mandates. They mindlessly follow along with politicians from Democrats and Republicans.
From the Graveyard of Civil Liberties, they rise again each year to take your freedoms. And they've already claimed many...
* RIP 4th Amendment (1791 - 2001) - Murdered by the Patriot Act & NSA spying.
* RIP 5th Amendment (1791 - 2009) - Murdered by the Military Commissions Act and civil asset forfeiture.
* RIP 6th Amendment (1791 - 1917) - Murdered by the Espionage Act & the unfair trials of whistleblowers.
The 2nd Amendment is now being eaten away by the ATF. The 10th Amendment is almost gone as the centralization of power corrupts from Washington D.C.
After generations of voting for the lesser of two evils, there is only evil left. It's scary. But there's hope.
Our campaign is building up a massive liberty movement. We are the future. With your help today, we can bring more people into the liberty movement.
The only way to defeat the zombies is with the fires of liberty. Donate today and help us fight back.

There's another debate tonight. What you'll hear is more of the same...
* Joe Biden will pretend he is the criminal justice reform candidate. In reality, he fought for the 1994 Crime Bill.
* Donald Trump will pretend to be ""conservative"" on government and the economy. The reality is our debt is skyrocketing more than under President Obama, the Fed is printing more than ever, and government continues to grow.
Let's not pretend these two candidates mean change. Let's not pretend voters HAVE to choose between them.
Our campaign has been surging since the last debate. Voters want a real choice. Jo is polling better than Gary Johnson did in 2016 in several key states.
Here's how we must prepare.
Jo announced an important goal of $350,000 for our Get-Out-The-Vote efforts. We must be prepared for the surge of voters looking outside of Trump and Biden.

Your support will mean more ads than ever before...
More volunteers on phones and texting...
But it also means we're on track to having the biggest year yet for our movement, Alex.
We're in a battle for the hearts and minds of voters. I know elections are messy. But this is when most people are following along with the ideas that shape our society.

Alex,
I know you already know this, but Jo has the best supporters in the country.
Real, hardworking, liberty-loving Americans who just want the freedoms promised to them by the Constitution are the engine to this campaign.
And it shows in the numbers.
Over 70% of the support Jo has received during this campaign has been from donors who gave $200 or less.
Compare this to Joe Biden (31%) and Donald Trump (49%) and it's easy to tell who the PEOPLE support. (Source: [[URL REDACTED]])

We're trying to raise at least $30,000 per day from here until election day.
That's the number our team has calculated we need to raise in order to fully fund our Get-Out-The-Vote efforts and make sure Jo has a chance of receiving the largest vote total of any Libertarian in history.
We are counting on your help. Will you help fund final Get-Out-The-Vote efforts in several key states. Can you click here to donate $5, $20.20, $50, $100, or any amount today?
Jo announced our Get-Out-The-Vote goal of $350,000 and our supporters have STEPPED UP.

# Jorgensen: Washington doesn’t want you to vote, which is why you must
Libertarian presidential nominee reassures voters they have enough influence to turn establishment on its head
“I don’t vote because it wouldn’t make any difference,” is the refrain heard from millions of Americans. They believe the system is rigged and that there’s no chance of getting the kind of candidate they’d want to see in office elected.
Dr. Jo Jorgensen, the Libertarian candidate for president, has a message for such voters.
“Washington, D.C. wants you demoralized,” said Jorgensen. “They don’t want you to vote because they need you to stay home in order for their status quo candidates to win.”
“Refusing to vote feeds right into their hands,” she added. “It doubles the impact of the voters who do, and it keeps career politicians, cronies, and special interests in power.”
“But you actually have much more influence over the system than you realize,” she said. “Enough, in fact, to turn the establishment on its head.”
In 2016, 102 million Americans were eligible to vote, but stayed home. Meanwhile, Donald Trump won the election for president with just 63 million votes.
“Americans who sit out elections hold an overwhelming majority in this country,” notes Jorgensen. “If just two-thirds of them voted, we could bring down the powers that be in Washington, D.C.”
“With a large turnout of anti-establishment voters, those who already vote but who have settled for the ‘lesser of two evils’ would vote their conscience instead. They’d join forces with you to bring in real outsiders,” she said.
“Don’t let media blackouts, manipulative polling, and fake debates trick you into believing you don’t have a choice,” she said. “You most definitely do have a real choice, and a chance for real change.”
Libertarian Jo Jorgensen is on every ballot in America this election — all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia.
“If you know the two-party system is broken and doesn’t serve your family’s needs, please vote for me this election,” she said.
Dr. Jorgensen advocates lowering health-care costs dramatically by way of free-market competition, bringing our troops home from endless foreign wars, allowing wage-earners to opt out of paying the Social Security (FICA) tax, and ending the failed and destructive War on Drugs.
Her campaign gives voters a viable alternative to Donald Trump and Joe Biden, who are the only other presidential choices appearing on every ballot.
This year marks the fifth time the Libertarian Party has succeeded in placing its presidential ticket on the ballot in all fifty states, having done so previously in 1980, 1992, 1996, and 2016.
“There’s no such thing as not voting,” said Jorgensen. “If they get you to stay home, you’re ‘voting’ for your opponents to win. If you want a different outcome, do something different.
“You hold the power to change everything. All you have to do is vote.”

Alex,
Here's some important information to put things into perspective.
2 days until the FINAL FEC Deadline
22 days until the election
36,706 individual contributors
We are quickly approaching election day and our October 14th FEC deadline. My Campaign Manager (Steve Dasbach) has informed me I must meet our $100,000 goal by midnight on the 14th and I need your help.
These funds are being used to persuade voters to our side and ultimately turn our supporters out to vote.
Since the debate, we've witnessed a SURGE in website traffic, voter pledges, new first-time donors, and new followers on social media.
People are in a decision making state of mind. We MUST reach them during this critical window of opportunity.
I am personally asking you to donate to our campaign today and make the most generous contribution you can before the October 14th deadline.
Can I count on your support today?
Stand with Jo: Donate $100
Stand with Jo: Donate $250
Stand with Jo: Donate $500
Stand with Jo: Donate $1,000
Stand with Jo: Donate any amount!
I said it before and I cannot stress this enough. You are the fuel to my campaign. Not corporations. Not special interests. Not the media.
I have been overwhelmed by the support. I truly believe this is the BIGGEST year for our political movement in terms of gaining the most votes.
People are fed up with their choices. They want someone REAL.
It is only a matter of reaching them. And that's how you can help me today.
Please help our campaign reach voters during this final month of the election. Please click here to donate $20.20, $50, $100, or any amount you can generously contribute >>

Jo Jorgensen 2020
Alex -- As you know the election is on Tuesday and many are expecting contested results for races across the country.
There is a serious threat not all votes cast for Libertarians will be counted.
Joe Biden and Donald Trump will likely fight over vote totals in battleground states... and they will be more than willing to throw third party candidates under the bus if they are able to.
Jo, the campaign team, the Libertarian Party, and our volunteers are fielding poll watchers to ensure your vote is counted, Alex.
However, we must fund these efforts to ensure we achieve the HIGHEST popular vote possible for Jo Jorgensen. Can you donate $1,000, $500, $250, $100, $50, $20.20, or even $5 to help fund this effort?
Why is this such a big deal?
Not only are we fighting to make sure every vote for Jo counts... but there are several states where Libertarian voters could have a SERIOUS impact on election outcomes.
* Indiana has a high polling gubernatorial candidate with a real shot of winning!
* Arkansas has a Senate candidate running against Tom Cotton without a Democrat in the race.
* Hundreds of Libertarians are running across the country who need our help to ensure their votes are counted.
We have a chance to make history in 2020. We must not risk losing ANY votes for Jo Jorgensen or other Libertarians.

There is little time left to act.
Did you see Jo's email this morning? She has called for an emergency last minute fundraising drive to raise $50,000 before the 11/3/20 6:00 ET deadline.
We have $32,000 left to raise.

Jo Jorgensen 2020
Alex --
Did you see Jo's big announcement yesterday?
Jo will need to raise $300,000 before the FEC deadline on September 30th.
Why?
* The FEC deadline will show the strength of each campaign.
* Trump and Biden's teams are afraid of voters hearing Jo's message. They will be following the FEC disclosure closely.
* This may be the biggest year yet for a Libertarian candidate to get 5% and build a bigger party than ever before.
Jo doesn't have the corporate establishment on her side. She only has us. Can you send an urgent donation of $5, $20.20, $50, or more? Click here to donate >>
The deadline is quickly approaching. Please send your support when you can.
FEC Deadline
Alex, like Jo said before. This is bigger than one election. We are building a movement in the United States. Our actions today will help ensure liberty is defended in the future.
We only have 41 days to go until the elections. Millions of Americans will need to hear our message before then.
Your support today will help ensure we give Americans a true choice at liberty in 2020.
Please send your donation today.

Jo will be watching the results closely. We are providing her with daily updates.

Alex, I have to keep this brief.
My campaign manager Steve gave me an update on online fundraising and we may be in some trouble. In order to keep our momentum, our campaign must raise $250,000 before September.
I know my team and I write to you a lot, but we have the unique challenge of building a multi-million dollar organization in the matter of months. We cannot rely on the establishment gatekeepers to reach voters. I have to reach them directly and that requires a lot of resources.
To complicate matters, COVID has disrupted many of our scheduled fundraising events. Therefore, I am more dependent on online support than ever before. Which is why I am emailing you right now, Alex.
Can you donate $5, $20.20, $50, or any amount you can generously afford? Please click here to give today.
You and I are giving voters a REAL choice in November.
I am the only candidate who will serve as a REAL choice for ALL voters outside of the Biden-Trump duopoly of corruption, war, and economic collapse.
Thank you for continuing to support our campaign and empower our movement.
Steve Dasbach, my campaign manager, will be updating me later this week. I hope to see your name on the list of supporters!
Thank you again,

Alex, I am campaigning every day and working so hard I think it's time we have a little fun through a friendly competition.
Donald Trump and Joe Biden are corrupt. They perpetuate the war machine, the corporate bailouts, the police state, and the collapse of our dollar through the Federal Reserve.
While I'm 100% committed to fighting for the principles of liberty, I do think a political movement and a revolution need to have fun now and then or face getting burned out.

Hello Alex,
We only have 41 days remaining until election day! While we are excited to have earned ballot access in all 50 states, it is imperative that we continue to gain as much momentum as possible from now until November 3rd. That is why we are wanting to run targeted campaign ads in your state.
As you can imagine though, advertising is expensive. Asking for donations is probably our least favorite thing to do but it's necessary for the success of our campaign. Literally every dollar we get from supporters like you helps us immensely. I crunched some numbers and for every $10 you are able to donate, that helps us reach about 2,500 people in YOUR state. That’s right, donations will go directly to ads in your state.
Please click here to donate $10, $20.20, $50, $100, or even $250 directly to your state’s campaign! How many people would you like to help reach?
In Liberty,

There you have it, Alex. A full 70.23% of our movement is fueled by hardworking Americans who believe in liberty chipping in $10, $50 or $100 at a time.
We are not bought and paid for by the corporations, the military industrial complex, nor the lobbyists.

President Obama, President Bush, and now President Donald Trump and Joe Biden's campaigns all receive major gifts from crony capitalists. They don't even try to hide it anymore.
It reminds me of NASCAR sponsors. They wear it openly on their sleeves.
I announced a few days ago our Get-Out-The-Vote goal of $350,000. Each dollar raised helps my campaign reach up to 11 voters before the election. It's critical we make this goal before November.

Alex, you and I have an opportunity to make history on Election Day.
This campaign has built a movement of hardcore believers in the ideas of liberty, free markets, and the Constitution. We've shown the establishment the American people are ready for a new option outside of the failed two-party system.
But our job isn't over yet.
We have the opportunity to earn a historic turnout for a Libertarian candidate and help others running as Libertarians across the country.
I am declaring an Emergency Pre-Election Moneybomb of $50,000 with a 11/3/2020 6:00 ET deadline.
I am raising funds to pay for last-minute persuasion and GOTV efforts as well as funding our poll watching operation to ensure ALL Libertarian votes are counted on Election Day.
Make no mistake -- If there are recounts or contested results, the two-party system will do everything in their power to throw third-party voters under the bus.
I refuse to let this happen.
Please help us reach last-minute voters, fund our poll watching operation, and turn out our supporters by donating ANY amount to our Emergency Pre-Election Moneybomb:

Alex,
Happy Independence Day!
Today, as we celebrate the day we declared our independence from the British empire, we look forward to declaring our independence from Washington DC this November by investing our vote in Dr. Jo Jorgensen for President.
The growth in support for the Jorgensen/Cohen ticket has been phenomenal. In June, their support increased by over 6% a day, day after day, for the entire month. If we can keep this up for the next two months, Dr. Jorgensen stands a real chance of reaching the 15% threshold in national polls needed to qualify for the debates.
The campaign’s ground game is also starting to come together. We just completed assembling our team of regional field organizers, and almost all state coordinators are in place as well.
We know that you have anxiously been awaiting yard signs, bumper stickers, buttons, door hangers, and other campaign materials to use locally. Great news – the last design step was completed last Friday, so materials should be made available this week. They should also be available at the national convention, and print masters will be available for groups that want to produce materials locally.
We hope you have a great Independence Day weekend! Take care.

Alex,
People are volunteering at an amazing rate – over 1,000 every week. We now have a nearly complete field operation to help organize volunteers and get the word out about Jo’s Presidential campaign.
National Field Director Joe Hauptmann is temporarily covering one group of states (NE, MN, IA, WI, IL, MI, IN). while Jo’s aide on the campaign trail Jess Mears is temporarily covering another (MS, AL, GA, SC, FL). Here is the rest of our field organizing team.
* Richard Manzo: VT, NH, ME, MA, CT, RI
* Elijah Gizzarelli: OH, PA, NY, NJ, MD, DE
* Cristi Kendrick: TN, KY, WV, VA, NC, DC
* Desarae Lindsey: KS, OK, TX, MO, AR, LA
* Seth Levy: AK, ID, MT, ND, SD, WY, UT, CO, NM
* Jake Porter: WA, OR, CA, NV, AZ, HI
We are searching for permanent organizers for the states Joe and Jess are currently covering. If you have strong campaign and/or organizing experience and would be interested in doing this full time, contact Joe at [[URL REDACTED]]
We are also working with state affiliates to recruit state and local organizers. Over three-fourths of the states have a state organizer or team in place, and our field organizers expect to the rest in place by the end of the week.
You can join the volunteer effort at [[URL REDACTED]] Once you submit the volunteer form, be sure to join the volunteer Slack group and check out 11 things you can do right now.

A personal progress report from Steve Dasbach, Campaign Manager of Jo Jorgensen for President.
Alex,
It’s hard to comprehend just how fast-paced a Presidential campaign is once you’ve won the nomination.
In the 48 hours after Jo won the nomination, over 5,000 new supporters signed up, including over 1,000 new volunteers, and over 600 new donors. All unsolicited.
We had to expand our communications team from one … to two … to three … to four in less than a week to keep up with the explosion of interest.
Jo is doing four to seven appearances or interviews per day, six days a week -- including local newspapers, radio, and TV, plus national outlets like the Washington Post, NPR’s Weekend Edition, and John Stossel.
Meanwhile, social media is growing like crazy.
Jo’s Facebook following has grown from 2,000 people to over 66,600 in just two weeks! Twitter has grown from 1,500 to over 32,200!
Two articles on Fox News and CNN have referenced our social media posts, as well as countless smaller media sources.
Our social media effort has reached 5 million people! And we've had over 1 million shares, reactions, or comments! Virtually all of which are enthusiastic about Jo’s campaign!
Our social media director has set up facebook pages in every state and is managing a 160+ volunteer army promoting the Jorgensen/Cohen ticket.
And those aren’t the only volunteers.
More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up, unsolicited, with more joining daily. If you volunteered and haven’t heard from us yet, send an email to [[URL REDACTED]] and our volunteer coordinator will hook you up.
Volunteering is a great way to help spread Jo’s principled and practical message. But donations are just as important.
We've raised more than $130,000 since the convention. That's a great start, but we must accelerate.
Our goal is to raise more money than the Johnson campaign. And put far more resources than any previous Libertarian campaign into direct voter outreach by keeping our overhead low.
This is how we grow our base of support, start showing up in polls, and get into the debates.
You and your spouse can donate a maximum of $2,800 each. But any amount will help, and the quicker we get it the better. Early money has the most value. Please go here to donate.
Let's find all those bystander libertarians and disaffected voters.
More news soon!

Alex,
Thank you so much for becoming a member of our campaign for President.
It means so much to me knowing I have your support.
The Libertarian Party, the liberty movement as a whole, and our ideas are poised for exponential growth in 2020.
The demand for criminal justice reform, ending the drug war, and restoring our civil liberties has never been greater.
We can't squander this opportunity...
Which is why I am asking to take the next step by making your FIRST online donation to the campaign.
My Campaign Manager, Steve Dasbach, has told me it is essential I recruit 1,000 new donors in order to finance a winning campaign and obtain ballot access in all 50 states.
Alex, recruiting 1,000 new donors to the campaign is my goal this week. I hope you'll consider being one of the first supporters to make a gift of $5, $10, $20.20, $50, $100, $250, $500 or even $1,000.
Donate $20.20
Donate $50
Donate $100
Donate $250
Donate $500
Donate $1,000
Donate Any Amount
Alex, your contribution will build the foundation of this campaign, enable us to achieve ballot access in all 50 states, and help me spread the message of liberty.
* I am fighting to restore our civil liberties.
* I am fighting to END the failed war on drugs that has destroyed so many families.
* I am fighting to bring the troops home from endless and unconstitutional wars.
* I am fighting terminate the surveillance state and end warrantless spying on everyday Americans.
Will you join me?
Please take the next step by making your first online contribution by clicking here.
Thank you so much,
Dr. Jo Jorgensen

Alex, I have a quick campaign update to share with you before the weekend.
First, we have officially launched our rebranded website and it looks great! You can check out the new website here: [[URL REDACTED]]
Secondly, this week we asked supporters to fill out our Official Supporter Survey (if you have not filled it out yet you can do so by clicking here) and we found some interesting results.
The top two most important issues selected were dealing with the $26 TRILLION+ national debt and ending the failed war on drugs.
Well, you don't need me to tell you how much our opponents have failed to address these two issues. Joe Biden has spent his entire life racking up the national debt and was a key player in building the drug war into the disaster it is today.
Donald Trump? He ran for President promising to get rid of the debt entirely... and has proceeded to hit a new record of $26 trillion. And he has certainly made no effort to end the war on drugs either.
Alex, it makes me proud to serve on Jo's campaign knowing she is a candidate who represents REAL change. Once Jo Jorgensen is in office, the drug war will be put to an end, non-violent criminals will be pardoned, and Jo will veto any bills that add a penny more to our debt.
Lastly, Jo wanted me to express how grateful she is for the outpouring of support she is receiving. We are on pace to make history as the biggest Libertarian presidential campaign ever and YOU are a part of the accomplishment.
Americans are waking up and desperately want an alternative to Joe Biden and Donald Trump.
Thank you for everything.

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Dr. Biden proves she would be the perfect First Lady,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Dr. Jill Biden is already acting like a First Lady.
She’s stepped up as a leader in the midst of these trying times \-- speaking out on the value of listening to the nation’s health experts, advocating for a Department of Education that once again puts teachers first, and even giving her husband advice on his ongoing VP search.
Dr. Biden has also earned a glowing endorsement from America’s previous first lady \-- with Michelle Obama saying of her: “Jill is not just brilliant, but she is kind. She is very funny, and she is one of the strongest people I know. I love and admire her with all my heart.""
We think Dr. Biden would be the perfect successor to Michelle’s legacy of strength through compassion, and we can’t wait to see how she’ll help Americans heal and feel inspired again. But we want to know where you stand \-- are you with Jill all the way to the White House? Tell us:
Do you support Jill Biden for FLOTUS?
YES NO
Thank you for taking the time to answer our survey. Your responses will help us craft a strategy to beat Trump and retake the Senate in November, so it really means a lot to us.

Alex,
Looking to suppress the vote in the midst of the COVID crisis, President Trump and the GOP have attacked voting by mail. Barack Obama won’t stand for that.
Earlier this week, Obama lamented the fact that voting by mail had become a “partisan issue,” pushing back against Trump and other GOP politicians who claim voting by mail will lead to voter fraud.
As Obama stated, maintaining free and fair elections should not be up for partisan debate. Voting by mail is the safest way to ensure full voter participation during this public health emergency. Though out of office, Obama is still fighting for the American people \-- let us know if you stand with our 44th president on this critical issue:

Alex,
Congress has been reluctant to pass direct aid to the American people. Many Americans were denied their $1200 stimulus checks \-- and no more payments are on the horizon, with Mitch McConnell drawing a red line against further government aid.
One check Congress didn’t have trouble writing? A $500 billion gift to corporate interests. And after removing or replacing Inspectors General that he didn’t deem loyal enough, Trump has finally found the perfect person to provide oversight of the money: the White House lawyer who helped defend Trump during his impeachment.
If you agree that we need to protect relief funds from going to a taxpayer-funded corporate bailout; if you agree we can’t trust Trump and his allies with $500 billion; and if you agree we need to expand relief payments for everyday Americans stuck at home or forced to the front lines, add your name to ours and demand Congress take action now!

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Shocking Rolling Stone report details GOP plan to block ballots and intimidate voters on Election Day,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Winning in November will come down to who votes. But in 2016, nearly 100 million Americans stayed home. Trump won the White House and Mitch McConnell controls the Senate. And a shocking new Rolling Stone exposé details: “Blocking ballots, intimidating voters, spreading misinformation – undermining democracy is at the heart of Trump’s 2020 campaign.”
Our mission is to turn out every single eligible Democratic voter in the country. And if we do, Trump will be handed the most embarrassing defeat of his lifetime, Mitch McConnell will lose control of the Senate, and Democrats will expand our House majority.
If Democrats control Washington, we’ll expand health care access to every single American in this country. Democrats will take bold action on climate change, expanding green jobs, and putting Americans back to work in a new green economy. Democrats will put a stop to the horrendous practice of putting immigrant children in cages and reopen our country with a fair immigration policy. And we’ll expand and protect access to Medicare and Social Security for our seniors and future generations.
But the GOP will stop at nothing to suppress Democratic voters. Thousands of voters FAILED to even get their absentee ballots in the recent primaries, and Donald Trump knows that the only way for him to win is to suppress the votes of Democrats in November.
We’re doing everything we can to fight back. But right now, we’re falling VERY SHORT of our fundraising goals.
If we don’t raise another $1,130 by midnight tonight, we’ll have to scale back our work turning out voters who are committed to beat Trump. We’ll have to cut support to Senate and House races around the country. If we fail, Trump will win 4 more years in the White House. The GOP and Mitch McConnell will keep control of the Senate. Trump will nominate 2 or more Supreme Court Justices. With the Supreme Court stacked with conservatives, the court could roll back access to choice for millions of women, roll back LGBTQ+ anti-discrimination laws, and repeal Obamacare.
That’s why we need every single committed Democrat to step up right now. Please, we’re asking you to donate now to beat Trump, take back the Senate, and protect the Democratic House majority. With YOUR support right now, Democrats will win, and Trump will be thrown from the White House in the biggest embarrassment of his lifetime.
We cannot thank you enough for all you’re doing every single day to elect Democrats.

The Debate Outcome,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,We need your input on this,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Last night, we saw Kamala Harris and Mike Pence lay out two drastically different visions for our country post Election Day.
After nearly four years with a failed Trump-Pence administration in the White House, our choice this November has never been clearer.
Kamala Harris provided a glimpse of a presidential administration that will lead with compassion, logic, and collective strength to move our country forward. But it’s up to us to fulfill that vision.
The New York Times assessed that last night’s debate will have “sky-high stakes” for the election, and we know that the vice presidential debate will significantly impact how Americans vote -- especially regarding who Americans perceive as the winner. That’s why today, we need to know where you stand after what could be the last debate this election cycle:
Who won the vice presidential debate?
Kamala Harris
Mike Pence

There are two Social Security trust funds inside the U.S. Treasury. One pays retirement and survivors benefits, while the other pays disability benefits.
According to a group of concerned Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives, both funds could be insolvent within the decade. In fact, lawmakers are so concerned that they’re advocating for special bipartisan “rescue committees” tasked only with keeping vital trust funds alive \-- because right now, they could be depleted as soon as 2029.
Roughly 65 million Americans receive Social Security. But within the last few months, employment has dropped suddenly and sharply \-- along with the number of people paying into the program.

Hello Alex,
Joe Biden honored Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg after her passing, saying Justice Ginsburg “stood for all of us. She was an American hero, a giant of legal doctrine, and a relentless voice in the pursuit of that highest American ideal: Equal Justice Under Law. May her memory be a blessing to all people who cherish our Constitution and its promise.”
Justice Ginsburg is remembered as a champion of justice, a defender of women’s rights and equality, and a fierce protector of our democracy.
Throughout her legal career she dedicated herself to advancing opportunity for every American, and she used her 27-year tenure as the second woman to be nominated to the Supreme Court to fortify the pillars of our democracy.
But Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump are threatening to destroy that legacy by pushing what will undoubtedly be a far-right judge to fill her seat and undo everything she stood for. We can’t allow Mitch McConnell to use his majority power to bypass the will of the American people, but that’s exactly what he’s getting away with now. We are taking a stand to honor the late Justice Ginsburg and everything she stood for, but we need to know, do you stand with us?
Will you vote to protect Ruth Bader Ginsburg's legacy?
YES NO

Biden appealed to the idea of a national healing steeped in humility, saying, “The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won’t either. But I promise you this: I won’t traffic in fear and division. I won’t fan the flames of hate.”
Unsurprisingly, Trump and his allies threw vitriol at Biden afterward \-- with one Trump advisor calling Biden’s thinking “crass,” and Trump himself calling the former vice president “weak.”

The justice’s past comments on Trump prove this attitude, with RBG going on record saying, “He is a faker. He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego... How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns?”
Advocates of the Supreme Court justice say she’s right to not pull any punches. But Trump has said RBG’s “mind is shot,” and she “has embarrassed all by making very dumb statements.” We want to know what you think:

Alex,
Trump and the GOP have another trick up their sleeve to steal the election \-- this time it’s an obscure 200-year-old law.
With the Electoral Count Act, Trump’s baseless accusations of Democratic election fraud can trigger a vote from state legislatures to block electoral votes for Joe Biden. There are 29 total Republican-controlled legislatures \-- including Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Those states alone equal 61 total electoral votes that Biden and Trump remain in a neck-and-neck battle for.
We can preemptively block Trump’s imminent ploy by voting in overwhelming numbers by November 3. If we turn out to defend and expand our House majority, especially in these key states, we would secure the state delegations we need and leave Trump with no choice but to respect the will of the American people.
But the GOP knows this, and for months, they’ve been funneling dark money where it’s needed most. And now The Cook Political Report has categorized 25 House races as “tossups,” and congressional races will only get tighter as Election Day nears.
Alex, the fact is that there is no boundary that Trump or the GOP won’t cross to steal the election from the American people. You, more than anyone, know that our country simply won’t survive another Trump-Pence term. That’s why we’re asking for your help to turn out Democrats in overwhelming numbers and hand Trump an irrefutable defeat. Will you pitch in now to support our efforts, remove Trump from office, expand our House majority, and take back the Senate in November?

Voter Turnout Initiative,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Washington Post: Massive participation is how we save democracy in America,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Donald Trump is putting together what he calls an “Army for Trump” \-- a poll-watching brigade of supporters he has called on to protect the election from the “radical left.”
Trump has worked to undermine confidence in the election for months, baselessly claiming that Democrats will use main-in-voting to steal the election. During the first presidential debate, he even suggested election officials couldn’t be trusted and urged his supporters to “go into the polls and watch very carefully,” laying the perfect groundwork to steal this election.
Trump won’t be able to do that if we show out in overwhelming numbers. As The Washington Post has reported: “high turnout trumps everything. In 2000, the Supreme Court was important because the election came down to 537 votes. But the court didn’t decide the election in 2004, 2008, 2012 or 2016. That’s the difference between 537 votes and 10,000. The voters have the power to put this one out of the legal system’s reach.”
But Trump’s anti-democratic tactics are already working \-- a group of his supporters in Virginia were seen intimidating voters and blocking entrances to polling places during early voting. We’re mobilizing to protect our voting rights and ensure every eligible voter turns in their ballot this November, but right now we don’t have the funds to expand our voter outreach efforts.
You more than anyone knows what’s at stake this election. Donald Trump’s election has brought us to the brink of authoritarianism -- and the chance to save our democracy won’t come again for another four years. Alex, will you pitch in now to turn out every single eligible Democrat in November and remove a wannabe tyrant from the White House, expand our House majority, and take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell’s grasp?

Millions of American workers are suffering due to the economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 crisis. Unfortunately, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell doesn’t seem to be in a big rush to help them.
McConnell believes he can get a new pandemic aid bill together in the next three weeks \-- even though this will mean millions will see their $600 boost in unemployment aid lapse when they expire on July 31st.
This is unfathomable \-- but not surprising from McConnell. He didn’t even believe in giving people extra aid to begin with.
Democrats have pushed for more aid \-- Chuck Schumer just announced a plan to give $350 billion in aid to communities of color hit hard by the crisis and House Democrats passed a $3 trillion bill back in May \-- but those efforts have been rebuffed by McConnell and the GOP-controlled Senate and President Trump.
It’s clear we need Democratic leadership back in the Senate and White House to accelerate the recovery process. Will you join us to vote BLUE in November? Let us now know:

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,51% of Americans think Trump will win again,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
A recent Pew Research Center poll found that 51% of Americans believe Donald Trump will defeat Joe Biden in November.
Ever since Donald Trump and Mike Pence swept the electoral college and overcame Hillary Clinton's and Tim Kaine’s sizable polling leads in 2016, we have seen federal law enforcement terrorize American cities, the USPS dismantled for political purposes, and over 190,000 Americans die from a pandemic that the Trump administration failed to take seriously.
All because 100 million voters stayed home on Election Day in 2016.
The choice is yours: stay home and risk another 4 years of Donald Trump and Mike Pence, or go out to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, bringing much needed change to the White House. We’re trying to craft our strategy to reach Democratic voters before November, but we don’t have enough data yet. That’s why we need you to update your November election plans NOW:
This November, I plan to vote for:
Biden-Harris
Trump-Pence
Third party
I'm not voting
We cannot win without your input, so thank you for your participation.

Voter Turnout Initiative,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Washington Post: Massive participation is how we save democracy,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Donald Trump is putting together what he calls an “Army for Trump” \-- a poll-watching brigade of supporters he has called on to protect the election from the “radical left.”
Trump has worked to undermine confidence in the election for months, baselessly claiming that Democrats will use main-in-voting to steal the election. During the first presidential debate, he even suggested election officials couldn’t be trusted and urged his supporters to “go into the polls and watch very carefully,” laying the perfect groundwork to steal this election.
Trump won’t be able to do that if we show out in overwhelming numbers. As The Washington Post has reported: “high turnout trumps everything. In 2000, the Supreme Court was important because the election came down to 537 votes. But the court didn’t decide the election in 2004, 2008, 2012 or 2016. That’s the difference between 537 votes and 10,000. The voters have the power to put this one out of the legal system’s reach.”
But Trump’s anti-democratic tactics are already working \-- a group of his supporters in Virginia were seen intimidating voters and blocking entrances to polling places during early voting. We’re mobilizing to protect our voting rights and ensure every eligible voter turns in their ballot this November, but right now we don’t have the funds to expand our voter outreach efforts.
You more than anyone knows what’s at stake this election. Donald Trump’s election has brought us to the brink of authoritarianism -- and the chance to save our democracy won’t come again for another four years. Alex, will you pitch in now to turn out every single eligible Democrat in November and remove a wannabe tyrant from the White House, expand our House majority, and take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell’s grasp?

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Peaceful protesters assaulted for Trump's photo-op,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
“They turned holy ground into a battleground.”
That’s how one reverend described the scene at St. John’s Church -- the site of President Trump’s Monday night photo-op. According to The New York Times, police began using tear gas and flashbangs to clear out the crowd of peaceful protesters surrounding the church so that Trump could get his photo taken with the Bible. Some demonstrators caught in the violence yelled that they’d been shot. Others cried out in pain as grenades exploded around them.
After about 17 minutes in front of the cameras, taking no questions and addressing no protesters, Trump decided to return to the safety of the White House -- possibly back to the bunker he spent the weekend hiding out in.
55% of Americans think the man who had his constituents battered, gassed, and shot so that he could take a self-righteous photo will win re-election in November. Let’s protest the very idea of that happening. Tell us:

Alex,
It’s less than 100 days until Election Day \-- and Joe Biden has a double digit lead in the polls.
But Hillary Clinton also had a big lead in 2016 \-- and lost on Election Day.
Winning in November will come down to who votes. But in 2016, nearly 100 million Americans stayed home. Trump won the White House while Mitch McConnell maintained control of the Senate.
Now, a shocking new Rolling Stone exposé details the GOP’s plans to suppress the vote in 2020: “Blocking ballots, intimidating voters, spreading misinformation – undermining democracy is at the heart of Trump’s 2020 campaign.”
Our mission is to turn out every single eligible Democratic voter in the country. And if we do, Trump will be out of the White House, Mitch McConnell will lose control of the Senate, and Democrats will expand our House majority.
If Democrats control Washington, we’ll expand health care access to every single American in this country. Democrats will take bold action on climate change by expanding green jobs and putting Americans back to work in a new green economy. Democrats will put a stop to the horrendous practice of putting immigrant children in cages and reopen our country with a fair immigration policy. And we’ll expand and protect access to Medicare and Social Security for our seniors and future generations.
But the GOP has raised millions in dark money to target Democratic voters \-- as Donald Trump begins to realize that the only way he can win in November is through voter suppression.
We’re doing everything we can to fight back. And unlike the GOP, we’re a grassroots effort relying on donors like you. But right now, we’re falling VERY SHORT of our fundraising goals.
If we don’t raise another $3,200 by midnight tonight, we’ll have to scale back our work turning out voters who are committed to beat Trump. We’ll have to cut support to Senate and House races around the country. If we fail, Trump will win 4 more years in the White House. The GOP and Mitch McConnell will keep control of the Senate. Trump will nominate 2 or more Supreme Court Justices. With the Supreme Court stacked with conservatives, the court could roll back access to choice for millions of women, roll back LGBTQ+ anti-discrimination laws, and repeal Obamacare.
That’s why we need every single committed Democrat to step up right now. Please, we’re asking you to donate now to beat Trump, take back the Senate, and protect the Democratic House majority. With YOUR support right now, Democrats will win, and Trump will be thrown from the White House in the biggest embarrassment of his lifetime.
We cannot thank you enough for all you’re doing every single day to elect Democrats.

In an attempt to make the country’s reopening as safe as possible, top CDC officials wrote a step-by-step guide for local authorities to use on how and when to best reopen restaurants and other shared spaces. It was supposed to be published.
But the Trump administration had another idea in mind \-- shelve the report and prevent CDC officials from speaking to the press.
Fortunately, federal officials decided to leak the guidance to the press, because they know just how important it is to the country. Trump then allowed the CDC to release official \-- but wildly less specific and less helpful \-- guidelines for reopening. And who knows what personal health advice Trump will choose to give the public at his next press conference.

Mitch McConnell blocked Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland from having a single hearing and then forced Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh onto the Court instead. When Obama told him about Russian election interference, Mitch refused to condemn the Russians because he wanted to help Trump instead. And he blocked universal background checks from having a Senate vote, even though 90% of Americans support this commonsense gun control measure.
Now, Mitch is packing the courts with Trump appointees after he himself caused a judiciary backlog, including appointing an unqualified former Kavanaugh court clerk to the powerful DC Court of Appeals. Mitch presided over Trump's sham trial without witnesses. And he continues to prevent debate on over 300 bipartisan bills passed by the House.
Daily Kos reports that the Kentucky Senate seat is a “Toss-Up Race between Amy McGrath (D) and Moscow Mitch (R).” And a Change Research poll shows Amy and Mitch TIED at 41-41.
But if Mitch wins re-election and the Republicans keep control of the Senate, Mitch will continue to play obstructionist to a Democratic president or worse, allow Donald Trump in his second term to stack the Supreme Court with up to FOUR MORE conservative nominees who will overturn Roe v. Wade, repeal Obamacare and gut our healthcare system, and give more tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations while slashing Medicare and Social Security.
Amy McGrath knows what it means to fight hard: she was the first woman to fly combat missions for the Marine Corps. If Amy wins in Kentucky, it would rid the Senate of Mitch McConnell and send a progressive woman to Capitol Hill. Amy will fight for affordable healthcare and against economic inequality by supporting more opportunities for working and middle-class Americans.
But we know Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump will stop at nothing to mislead, outright lie, suppress Democrats’ votes, and destroy Amy McGrath if they can. So we need your urgent support to protect every single vote in Kentucky, beat Mitch McConnell, elect Amy McGrath, and take back control of the Senate. Please, can you help get Mitch out of the Senate by supporting Amy McGrath with a donation of $5 or anything you can today?
Amy McGrath needs every Democrat on board if she's going to win in November.

Hi Alex,
Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison is closing in on Donald Trump’s favorite senator, South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham. A recent poll by Quinnipiac University showed the two candidates tied in the dark-red Palmetto State.
Considered a long-shot just last year, Harrison has a real chance to take down Graham.
Despite once calling Donald Trump a “race-baiting, xenophobic bigot,"" Graham has become Trump’s staunchest supporter on Capitol Hill \-- leading The Intercept to call Graham “The Most Shameless Man in American Politics.”
Graham led the charge against Democratic impeachment efforts \-- actually arguing that Trump was too stupid to break the law: “What I can tell you about the Trump policy toward Ukraine: It was incoherent, it depends on who you talk to, they seem to be incapable of forming a quid pro quo, so no I find the whole process to be a sham and I'm not going to legitimize it.”
Ultimately, Graham’s support helped keep Trump in office. Now, Trump is undermining the U.S. Postal Service in a desperate attempt to stay in the White House and help vulnerable GOP senators like Graham stay on Capitol Hill.
A Graham defeat would hand Democrats control of the Senate \-- but we need to know where you stand as we shape our strategy to turn out voters this fall. Barack Obama, VP nominee Kamala Harris, and other top Democrats are backing Harrison. Do you also support Jaime Harrison or Trump’s best friend Lindsey Graham? Let us know now:

Alex,
Axios News has reported it’s likely Trump will win in a landslide on election night \-- or at least appear to, until all the mail-in ballots are counted over the ensuing days and weeks.
Trump will use that opportunity to try to cling to power, building on the foundation he’s laid through casting doubt on vote-by-mail, accusing Democrats of rigging the election, and toying with the idea of disputing the results if Biden wins.
That means the stakes of beating Trump in 2020 have never been higher \-- both on election night and in the days and weeks that follow.
And it means we cannot stop the important work we’re doing to lock down a Democratic Congress, which would be all the more crucial in a second Trump term. We’re proud to have already endorsed and supported 21 Democrats in the House and the Senate \-- Democrats who are well on their way to victory because of supporters like you. We now need to redouble our outreach efforts \-- to voters in battlegrounds like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania and across the country \-- and compel Americans to cast their ballots in the most important election of our lifetimes.
We know Republicans will do anything to suppress the vote, legally or otherwise, with their piles of dark money and Trump campaign funds. And we know voter burnout is just as much of a threat as the GOP \-- it feels like this election cycle has been going on forever.
But it won’t last forever. It’s now late September, we’ve got just 5 weeks until the biggest election of our lives \-- and we’re being outspent. If we don’t turn this around quickly, we’ll have to scale back, which means turning out fewer Democratic votes and giving Republicans a chance to reclaim the House, hold onto the Senate, and keep the White House.
We need to show up in full force this election. That’s why we’re writing to you \-- we know the future of this country weighs heavily on your mind. We hope you’ll help us move this country onto the right path forward.
If you believe in protecting our democracy, we need you now. If you believe in stopping Trump’s destruction of America, we need you now. If you believe in fighting back against GOP voter suppression, we need you now. Please, help us turn out the vote and get Trump out of the White House by giving whatever you can today.

By ‘these idiots,’ Trump is referring to the countless public health officials who have been working around the clock to keep us safe since this pandemic began \-- all while Trump and his Republican loyalists willfully undermine social distancing efforts, refuse to wear masks, and prematurely rollback coronavirus restrictions while overlooking the 220,000 American lives now lost to the virus.

But Trump continues to attack Dr. Fauci for his honesty, calling him a “disaster” and claiming Americans don’t want to listen to health guidelines anymore. No public official should have to endure what Dr. Fauci has, and as Trump drags our most credible expert’s name through the mud, we’re standing by Dr. Fauci’s work.

America’s standing in the world, loyalty to allies, commitment to democratic values, constitutional checks and balances, faith in reason and science, concern for Earth’s health, respect for public service, belief in civility and honest debate, beacon to refugees in need, aspirations to equality and diversity and basic decency \-- Mr. Trump torched them all.”
The Washington Post has sounded the alarm: Donald Trump and Mike Pence’s re-election would cause irreparable harm to American democracy.
Four more years of Trump and Pence would mean more kids in cages, the end of Obamacare, the destruction of Social Security and Medicare, further isolation of the United States on the world stage, and the continued rule of an increasingly authoritarian president hell-bent on punishing political opponents.
The only thing standing in the way of this catastrophe is Democratic voters like you. Democratic voters stayed home in 2016 \-- handing Donald Trump and Mike Pence the White House.
We cannot have a repeat of 2016 \-- our democracy simply cannot survive another Trump-Pence term. We must get every single committed Democratic to support Joe Biden and Kamala Harris this November.
We’re planning our final push to get Democrats to the polls. But we need you to update your election plans as we finalize our strategy for the fall. That’s why we need to know now who YOU are voting for this November:
This November, I plan to back:
Joe Biden

Scientific American, the country’s longest continuously published science journal, just endorsed Joe Biden for the presidency, breaking a 175 year commitment to remain neutral \-- and stating “we’d love to stay out of politics, but this president has been so anti-science that we can’t ignore it.”
Since his election, Trump has blocked stricter air pollution standards, denied the devastating effects of climate change, and ardently embraced anti-science conspiracy theories \-- telling Americans, against the suggestion of his own health experts, that they could use hydroxychloroquine, bleach, and sunlight to treat the coronavirus.
Biden urged us to ask ourselves what our future could look like: “If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if we have more of America ablaze? If you give a climate denier four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised when more of America is underwater?”
Our country simply won’t survive another Trump-Pence term. That’s why we’re planning a new engagement strategy to get Democrats to the polls in overwhelming numbers and support Joe Biden and Kamala Harris this November.

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Trump's protest hypocrisy revealed,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
When armed militia members mobbed the Michigan Capitol to protest Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home order, Trump defended them \-- saying, “These are very good people, but they are angry,” and advising Whitmer to “give a little” \-- telling her to “See them, talk to them, make a deal.”
A month later, when protests began in Minneapolis over police brutality, Trump had this to say:
A @realDonaldTrump tweet that reads ""[[URL REDACTED]] THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won't let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!"" A notice from Twitter above the tweet flags it for violating the website's rules on the glorification of violence.
Source: Twitter
Trump swung from “see them, talk to them, make a deal” to “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” We’re glad Twitter has called the president out for his vile glorification of violence, but we also need to hold Trump accountable for his toxic hypocrisy \-- and to do it now, before more people get hurt.

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,FiveThirtyEight: Too soon to count Trump out,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
The good news continues for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Last week, the Democratic ticket had the biggest polling lead heading into the party convention since 1996 with a comfortable seven-point lead on Donald Trump and Mike Pence, according to Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight.
However, FiveThirtyEight’s Geoffrey Skelley and Nathaniel Rakich were quick to point out that the race is entering “a traditionally volatile period for presidential campaigns” and that the Biden-Harris lead would undoubtedly shrink.
Donald Trump and Mike Pence can still win \-- just as they were able to overcome Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine’s sizable polling leads in 2016. And since then, we have seen federal law enforcement terrorize American cities, the USPS dismantled for political purposes, and over 180,000 Americans die from a pandemic that the Trump administration failed to take seriously.
All because 100 million voters stayed home on Election Day in 2016.
The choice is yours: stay home and risk another 4 years of Donald Trump and Mike Pence, or go out to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, bringing much needed change to the White House. We’re trying to craft our strategy to reach Democratic voters before November, but we don’t have enough data yet. That’s why we need you to update your November election plans NOW:

Alex,
As top fundraiser for this week’s Republican National Convention, Louis DeJoy was a key member of Trump’s re-election campaign.
DeJoy continues to work hard for a Trump victory \-- only now, he’s Postmaster General.
The drastic changes DeJoy brought to USPS, including removing neighborhood mail boxes, removing mail sorting machines from post offices, and delaying mail service, have caused chaos around the country \-- and called into question the agency’s ability to handle mail-in voting this November.
That’s by design. His main benefactor and boss Donald Trump is not a big fan of mail-in voting, and so DeJoy is doing everything in his power to disrupt this election \-- even if it means destroying the USPS.
And while DeJoy has said he would delay these changes until after the election, he’s also refusing to reverse the damage he caused in the first place.
Political operatives like DeJoy have no business running the nation’s most vital public service. 78 percent of Americans want the USPS to be fully funded and prepared for this November’s election \-- but that can’t happen with DeJoy at the helm. Do you agree? Let us know now:

USPS’s 600,000+ employees bring crucial correspondence, life saving medicine, and vote-by-mail ballots to millions of Americans regardless of their geography or their income. The agency has existed since 1775 under Postmaster General Ben Franklin.
But USPS doesn’t receive direct taxpayer assistance \-- and under Republican rule, it will be bankrupt by September. Trump says it’s the USPS’ fault for not charging enough for packages.

Amy Coney Barrett, when asked about her stance on gay marriage in the United States by the Senate Judiciary Committee, dodged the question and used the phrase “sexual preference,” implying that homosexuality is a choice. She’s since apologized, saying that she “would never mean to use a term that would cause any offense in the LGBTQ community.” But she did use it. And now LGBTQ+ Americans know exactly how Judge Barrett views them.
As Trump’s latest far-right nominee, Barrett’s legal track record includes ruling against reproductive health care and immigrant rights \-- and she has brazenly criticized the Supreme Court for upholding the Affordable Care Act, an Obama-era policy that has made health care more affordable for millions of Americans.
A FiveThirtyEight poll found that over 50% of Americans think that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat should be filled by the next elected president. But rather than listen to the will of the American people, Trump loyalist Mitch McConnell is ramming through Barrett’s confirmation hearings to secure Trump’s far-right control of our highest court before voters can have a say on Election Day. In Mitch McConnell’s own words: “That’s the plan and there’s nothing I can see that would keep that from happening.”
The Washington Post has warned that shifting to a 6-3 Supreme Court Trump majority would be “seismic,” which is why Joe Biden has demanded that Trump’s nominee be withdrawn if Biden wins the election \-- to reflect the true will of the American people. But Republicans are rallying behind Barrett, saying she is exactly “whom the American people deserve to have on their highest court.” The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to approve her nomination on Thursday, so we need to know TODAY:

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Axios: Trump will likely win in a landslide on November 3,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Axios News has reported it’s likely Trump will win in a landslide on election night -- or at least appear to, until all the mail-in ballots are counted over the ensuing days and weeks.
Trump will use that opportunity to try to cling to power, building on the foundation he’s laid through casting doubt on vote-by-mail, accusing Democrats of rigging the election, and toying with the idea of disputing the results if Biden wins.
That means the stakes of beating Trump in 2020 have never been higher -- both on election night, and in the days and weeks that follow.
And it means we cannot stop the important work we’re doing to lock down a Democratic Congress, which would be all the more crucial in a second Trump term. We’re proud to have already endorsed and supported 21 Democrats in the House and the Senate -- Democrats who are well on their way to victory because of supporters like you. We now need to redouble our outreach efforts -- to voters in battlegrounds like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania and across the country -- and compel Americans to cast their ballots in the most important election of our lifetimes.
We know Republicans will do anything to suppress the vote, legally or otherwise, with their piles of dark money and Trump campaign funds. And we know voter burnout is just as much of a threat as the GOP -- it feels like this election cycle has been going on forever.
But it won’t last forever. It’s now late-September, we’ve got just 6 weeks until the biggest election of our lives -- and we’re being outspent. If we don’t turn this around quickly, we’ll have to scale back, which means turning out fewer Democratic votes and giving Republicans a chance to reclaim the House, hold onto the Senate, and keep the White House.
We need to show up in full force this election. That’s why we’re writing to you -- we know the future of this country weighs heavily on your mind. We hope you’ll help us move this country onto the right path forward.
If you believe in protecting our democracy, we need you now. If you believe in stopping Trump’s destruction of America, we need you now. If you believe in fighting back against GOP voter suppression, we need you now. Please, help us turn out the vote and get Trump out of the White House by giving whatever you can today.

Alex,
Winning in November will come down to who votes \-- but in 2016, nearly 100 million Americans stayed home as Trump won the White House and Mitch McConnell held on to the Senate. And this year, Rolling Stone reports, “Blocking ballots, intimidating voters, spreading misinformation \-- undermining democracy is at the heart of Trump’s 2020 campaign.”
Our mission is to turn out every single eligible Democratic voter in the country. And if we do, Trump will be handed the most embarrassing defeat of his lifetime, Mitch McConnell will lose control of the Senate, and Democrats will expand our House majority.
If Democrats control Washington, we’ll expand health care access to every single American in this country. Democrats will take bold action on climate change by expanding green jobs and putting Americans back to work in a new green economy. Democrats will stop the horrendous practice of putting immigrant children in cages and reopen our country with a fair immigration policy. And we’ll expand and protect access to Medicare and Social Security for our seniors and future generations.
But the GOP will stop at nothing to suppress Democratic voters. Thousands of voters FAILED to even receive their absentee ballots in the recent primaries, and Donald Trump knows that the only way for him to win is to stop Democrats from voting in November.
We’re doing everything we can. But right now, we’re falling VERY SHORT of our fundraising goals.
If we don’t raise another $1,224 by midnight tonight, we’ll have to scale back our work of turning out voters to beat Trump. We’ll have to cut support to Senate and House races around the country. If we fail, Trump will win 4 more years in the White House, the GOP and Mitch McConnell will keep control of the Senate, and Trump will nominate 2 \-- or more \-- Supreme Court justices. With the Supreme Court stacked with conservatives, it would be free to roll back access to reproductive freedom, weaken LGBTQ+ anti-discrimination laws, and repeal Obamacare.
That’s why we need every single committed Democrat to step up right now. Please, we’re asking you to donate now to beat Trump, take back the Senate, and protect the Democratic House majority. With YOUR support right now, Democrats will win and Trump will be thrown out of the White House in the biggest embarrassment of his lifetime.

Hold Trump Accountable,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,POLITICO: Expect Trump to do something weird,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
POLITICO: “Even if Trump calmly walks out the door of the White House on the morning of January 20th, a more immediate problem looms: What might Trump do with the final 77 days of his presidency if he loses? There are 1,860 hours between Wednesday, Nov. 4, and noon on Jan. 20, when Trump’s first term expires. And that’s plenty of time for him to upend plenty of presidential traditions.”
What might an egotistical narcissist like Donald Trump do when American voters don’t let him have his way? Well, political experts are warning he could do all sorts of things: hold a ‘pardon-a-palooza’ for all his favorite cronies (including himself), codify his disastrous policies into law, or even destroy official records to display himself as a martyr.
David Frum from the Atlantic has said that “the more Trump can propagate wild claims during his lame-duck presidency, the tighter he can bolt the conservative messaging machine to his cause during his post-presidency.” This is especially true if Democrats fail to prepare for, and stand against, Trump’s imminent acts.
With a character like Trump, we know better than to think that ending his term will end his influence, but many Americans are weary of 45 and would rather let him go freely than see any more days with him on the news. We believe Democrats should hold Trump accountable in his potential last days; do you?

Trump will use that opportunity to try to cling to power, building on the foundation he’s laid through casting doubt on vote-by-mail, accusing Democrats of rigging the election, and toying with the idea of disputing the results if Biden wins.
That means the stakes of beating Trump in 2020 have never been higher \-- both on election night, and in the days and weeks that follow.
And it means we cannot stop the important work we’re doing to lock down a Democratic Congress, which would be all the more crucial in a second Trump term. We’re proud to have already endorsed and supported 21 Democrats in the House and the Senate \-- Democrats who are well on their way to victory because of supporters like you. We now need to redouble our outreach efforts to voters in battlegrounds like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania and across the country, and compel Americans to cast their ballots in the most important election of our lifetimes.
We know Republicans will do anything to suppress the vote, legally or otherwise, with their piles of dark money and Trump campaign funds. And we know voter burnout is just as much of a threat as the GOP \-- it feels like this election cycle has been going on forever.
But it won’t last forever. It’s now late September, we’ve got just under 6 weeks until the biggest election of our lives \-- and we’re being outspent. If we don’t turn this around quickly, we’ll have to scale back, which means turning out fewer Democratic votes and giving Republicans a chance to reclaim the House, hold onto the Senate, and keep the White House.
We need to show up in full force this election. That’s why we’re writing to you \-- we know the future of this country weighs heavily on your mind. We hope you’ll help us move this country onto the right path forward.
If you believe in protecting our democracy, we need you now. If you believe in stopping Trump’s destruction of America, we need you now. If you believe in fighting back against GOP voter suppression, we need you now. Please, help us turn out the vote and get Trump out of the White House by giving whatever you can today.

Voter Turnout Initiative,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Washington Post: Massive voter participation is how we save our democracy,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Donald Trump is putting together what he calls an “Army for Trump” \-- a poll-watching brigade of supporters he has called on to protect the election from the “radical left.”
Trump has worked to undermine confidence in the election for months, baselessly claiming that Democrats will use mail-in voting to steal the election. During the first presidential debate, he even suggested election officials couldn’t be trusted and urged his supporters to “go into the polls and watch very carefully,” laying the perfect groundwork to steal this election.
Trump won’t be able to do that if we show out in overwhelming numbers. As The Washington Post has reported: “high turnout trumps everything. In 2000, the Supreme Court was important because the election came down to 537 votes. But the court didn’t decide the election in 2004, 2008, 2012 or 2016. That’s the difference between 537 votes and 10,000. The voters have the power to put this one out of the legal system’s reach.”
But Trump’s anti-democratic tactics are already working \-- a group of his supporters in Virginia were seen intimidating voters and blocking entrances to polling places during early voting. We’re mobilizing to protect our voting rights and ensure every eligible voter turns in their ballot this November, but right now we don’t have the funds to expand our voter outreach efforts.
You more than anyone know what’s at stake this election. Donald Trump’s election has brought us to the brink of authoritarianism -- and the chance to save our democracy won’t come again for another four years. Alex, will you pitch in now to turn out every single eligible Democrat in November and remove a wannabe tyrant from the White House, expand our House majority, and take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell’s grasp?

Stand with Warren,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,"Senator Warren: Trump's SCOTUS nomination an ""illegitimate power grab""","When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
The Hill: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said… that she will not meet with President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, calling the nomination an 'illegitimate power grab.'”
Senator Warren recognizes that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is set to steal another Supreme Court seat, just like he did in 2016. And Trump has chosen his perfect nominee to shape the court forever: Judge Amy Coney Barrett, an extremist who will overturn Roe v. Wade, endorse Trump’s attack on immigrants, strip away voting rights, and let the judiciary become a puppet for corporate interests.
Senator Warren has been a trailblazer from the beginning, doing everything she can to protect our democracy from GOP tyranny this election cycle. She’s advocated for a national vote-by-mail initiative and has pressured Congress to investigate Trump’s multi-millionaire donor, Louis DeJoy, and his destruction of the USPS.
By refusing to meet with Judge Barrett, Senator Warren is standing up to Republican destruction of our third branch of government. But Mitch McConnell is determined to push a vote in the Senate for Trump’s nominee by the end of October.
Senator Warren is counting on us to join her in her fight to save our democracy. We need to know if you’re a supporter, so we must ask:
Do you approve of Elizabeth Warren?
YES NO

Alex,
Recent polling shows Senator Elizabeth Warren is the most popular choice among Democrats for Biden’s vice president, with POLITICO writing, “Warren (plus-48 percentage points) edges out Harris (44 points) and Klobuchar (38 points) in net favorability.”
On MSNBC, Warren said she’d say “yes” if asked. But other candidates are jockeying for the VP slot, and Trump has repeatedly attacked Warren for being “mean” and has refused to stop calling her “Pocahontas” in the media.
Since she’s got so many competitors for the slot and with the record of presidential attacks on her character, we need to know where Democrats stand:

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Joe Biden's enthusiasm gap could ultimately be his downfall,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
This time in 2016, Hillary Clinton was leading Donald Trump in a Fox News voter enthusiasm poll by almost 10 points. Fast forward to 2020 \-- and Joe Biden is trailing Trump by 16.
If Trump’s diehard base of loyalists gives him another four years in the Oval Office, he’ll have free rein to enact the worst of his re-election campaign promises. Trump is already set to announce the pick for his next Supreme Court justice. His list is full of anti-choice, anti-health care radicals who are young enough to shape the laws of our land for the next half-century.
And if Mitch McConnell keeps the Senate, he’ll keep blocking any effort by Democrats in the House to help everyday Americans \-- and he is likely to add another 400 bills to his “legislative graveyard,” as he’s so proudly done in the past few years.
In 2018, we proved that we can win. Our victory took back the House \-- and we know that now is the time to build on our momentum and take back the White House, too. We’re working hard to protect our elections from Republican attacks by getting as many Democrats as possible to turn out to vote safely in 2020. We know we’ll need a massive blue wave to stop the rising red tide.
But Trump and the RNC have raised over $1 billion to defeat Democrats and suppress voters ahead of November. They have allies in Big Oil, Big Pharma, and the Big Banks. Incumbents usually win re-election, precisely because of how much power they wield and how many allies they have on their side.
It’s all the more reason that we cannot miss ANY of our fundraising goals.
But right now, we’re falling behind.
Our work is 100% funded by thousands of grassroots supporters across the country: Democrats like you who care about the future of our country. Democrats are stepping up and giving $5, $25, or $50 because they believe that the work we’ll do over the next year will have a profound impact on the future of our country for decades to come.
If you care about protecting voters, if you care about replacing Donald Trump and Mike Pence with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, if you want to remove Mitch McConnell from power, or if you want to stop the worst of the damage that Trump and the Republicans are doing to our democracy: please, we’re asking you to donate immediately to support our work turning out voters, stopping GOP voter suppression, protecting our House majority, taking back the Senate from Mitch McConnell, and getting Trump out of the White House.

Alex,
Good news coming out of South Carolina: Biden is narrowing Trump’s lead. He is now just one point behind, when just a mere two weeks ago Trump was ahead by 51% to 45%.
Trump is recovering from his reprehensible debate performance: He made it clear to Americans that he has no plan for preserving health care coverage, combating climate change, and helping the economy. On top of it all, he refused to condemn white supremacists. This is a new low \-- even for Trump.
It seems like the voters agree \--Trump’s lead in critical states is growing tenuous. The American people are increasingly seeing Trump as the racist con man he is. In South Carolina and other battleground states, we need to capitalize on his debate performance and immediately increase our support for Biden and other Democrats.
We know that the GOP has the financial advantage. Trump and Mitch McConnell will continue to tap into their network of billionaires and corporations. They will use these funds to rally their base and suppress the Democratic vote.
We need to know where we stand on voter turnout. We can’t afford to relive 2016’s disaster, when 100 million voters chose to stay home on Election Day. Please, we do not have enough data yet and need your input to craft our strategy. Tell us what your plan is:

Alex,
Donald Trump and the GOP are scheming to steal the election by pushing forward Amy Coney Barrett’s SCOTUS confirmation hearings, even in the midst of a raging COVID-19 outbreak on Capitol Hill.
Trump’s been trying to compromise the integrity of the election for months by falsely accusing Democrats of mail-in voting fraud. He’s even said publicly that he’s “counting on [the Supreme Court] to look at the ballots” in the case of a contested election. And with Barrett on the Court, Trump’s win is almost a guarantee.
Their plans won’t work if Democrats submit their ballots and show up to the polls in droves. Massive, overwhelming voter turnout is the only surefire way to prevent a contested election that ends up in the hands of SCOTUS. Democrats have done it before \-- it’s how we turned the House blue in the 2018 midterms.
But Trump’s evil plans are already in motion \-- he has COVID-19-positive Republican senators pledging to move forward with ACB’s nomination by whatever means necessary, with one vowing to wear a “moon suit” if he has to in order to vote for Trump’s pick. When Democrats Turn Out is working day and night to activate voters across the country and ensure every eligible voter has their voice heard this November \-- but we’re running low on the funds we need to expand our voter mobilization efforts.
You, more than anyone, know what’s at stake this election.

According to The Washington Post, “more than 500 children who, having been wrenched from their families by U.S. government officials with no plan or mechanism ever to reunite them, remain separated.”
A new report by the U.S. Justice Department and the ACLU clarifies that, despite a federal judge’s order that the Trump administration reunite families who were separated by Trump’s cruel “zero tolerance” policy, the parents of 545 children still can’t be found.
Starting in 2017, thousands of families were separated on Trump’s command, with Trump’s attorney general Jeff Sessions telling immigration officials that “we need to take away children” \-- all part of the Trump administration’s inhumane strategy to deter immigrants from seeking amnesty in our country.
Now the government can’t reunite these over 500 children with their parents, and the ACLU reports that over 300 separated children have been lost in the foster care system.
Trump has previously defended his policy with support from his followers, callously claiming that “when you allow the parents to stay [[URL REDACTED]] what happens is people are going to pour into our country.” Many of us have grown numb to Trump’s disturbing acts, but as the Supreme Court prepares to hear two cases that will decide the future of Trump’s restrictive amnesty policies after 2020, we need to know where YOU stand on his failed immigration legacy:
Do you condemn separating families?
YES NO

Donald Trump’s former campaign staff went to the White House to deliver the latest polling data: it shows he’s losing ground.
The president is now behind Joe Biden in Florida and Arizona, and Trump won Arizona by over 3 points in 2016. Even more alarming for the GOP, Biden has also caught up to Trump in Georgia \-- which means a state no Democratic presidential contender has won in almost 30 years is now in play.
In response, the president called top operatives from Florida and Arizona to an immediate meeting at the White House \-- it looks like Trump and his team have started to panic.
They have good reason to. But 50% of Americans still see Trump as a “strong leader,” and a New York Times report says state polls could be off again this year like they were in 2016. Ultimately, whether or not Trump should be worried comes down to you \-- tell us:

However, Hillary Clinton was also up double digits in polls before the 2016 election and still lost on Election Day.
With Trump as president, we have seen kids put into cages in the name of national security, a conservative Supreme Court that continues to strip away voting rights, and 160,000 Americans dead during a pandemic that could have been contained.
All because 100 million voters decided to stay home from the polls in 2016.

Now, Greenberg is urging Biden to do the same, pointing to Warren’s unique ability to unify the Democratic party \-- concluding simply that “Sen. Warren is the obvious solution.”
A recent POLITICO/Morning Consult poll confirms that Warren would give Biden the largest bump of any VP pick. But some voters worry Warren would make an easy target for Trump, who’s made no effort to hide his animosity for the senator he derisively calls “Pocahontas.”

Alex,
President Trump is ranting on Twitter again. And, unfortunately, some of his latest tweets were racist.
In one tweet, Trump criticized NASCAR’s decision to ban the Confederate flag. He also called for Bubba Wallace, NASCAR’s only black driver, to apologize for an incident that the organization thought was a hate crime. The FBI later determined no crime was committed \-- and though the situation was not Wallace’s fault, the president still felt the need to belittle the driver on Twitter.
Next, Trump attacked Washington’s pro football team and the Cleveland Indians baseball team for starting discussions on changing their names away from Native American themes. For good measure, Trump ended his tweet by mocking Elizabeth Warren, a frequent target of his racial insults.
As Americans of all walks of life take to the streets to push for racial justice, we need leadership that can unite the country and help bring about an end to systemic racism. Instead, President Trump regularly helps to fan the flames of racial tension with his racist rhetoric on social media. We, as a nation, deserve better. Tell us:

President Trump has significantly weakened Obamacare. A Biden administration could fix it back up.
Joe Biden has committed to protecting and expanding Obamacare, and a recent report by the Center for American Progress shows how it could happen. The plan would include cutting treatment costs and expanding coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, as well as bolstering enrollment efforts to make sure more Americans get the care they need.
The current public health crisis has greatly underscored the importance of expanding health care access. More than 5 million people lost their health coverage due to pandemic-related job losses, yet the Trump administration blocked the creation of a special enrollment period that would have allowed the recently unemployed to enroll in Obamacare.
But Joe Biden is committed to expanding health care access for all Americans. Do you think now’s the time to give our citizens the care they need? Let us know:

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Ever wondered why there's no Republican plan for health care?,"When Democrats Turn Out
Hi Alex,
Ever wondered why you can’t describe a Republican plan for health care?
… or climate change?
… or reducing gun violence?
… or battling a pandemic?
That’s because there isn’t one.
The GOP has controlled the presidency for almost the last four years and held unified control of government for two of those years. And yet Americans continue to pay twice as much for health care as the citizens of any other major country, the threats from climate change have risen from largely theoretical to urgent and devastating, and over 36,000 Americans are killed by guns every year.
And in the face of all these challenges, the GOP hasn’t lifted a finger.
Worse, they’ve fought to strip away Americans’ pre-existing conditions, allow Big Polluters to run rampant around the country, and made it easier for people who should not have a gun to obtain one.
And that’s the difference between Democrats and Republicans in Congress. It’s not that they have different plans for addressing our nation’s biggest problems \-- it’s that one party has plans, and one party wants to throw spitballs at those plans from the back of the classroom.
Is it any wonder then, that in the middle of a pandemic, Democrats like Elizabeth Warren are unveiling comprehensive plans to move our nation forward, while the Republican stooge-in-chief can’t even be convinced to wear a facemask? Is it any wonder that Republican leadership has marshalled a historically bad response to the pandemic \-- a national embarrassment that’s proved less effective than almost every other major country’s by nearly every metric?
Unfortunately, the last four years have proven that if we want the government to value our top priorities, we can’t remain spectators any longer.
The Republicans aren’t interested in compromise. All that’s left to do, then, is to beat them in November.
When Democrats Turn Out is laser-focused on electing Democrats with a broad spectrum of progressive ideas so that together, we can make health care more accessible and affordable, fight climate change, address gun violence, and even turn the tide against the pandemic.
But Alex, we need your help to make that progressive government a reality. Can you chip in $25, $10, even $5, today to put Democrats who care about your well-being at the helm of the federal government and make a national embarrassment of Trump and his far-right GOP lackeys?

Alex,
Last Monday, the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to overturn an extension for Wisconsin voters to turn in absentee ballots \-- even though over 400,000 absentee ballots were outstanding and nearly 10,000 voters hadn’t even yet been mailed their ballots. Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, saying: “The Court’s suggestion that the current situation is not ’substantially different’ from an ’ordinary election’ boggles the mind.”
Trump appointees Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch disenfranchised Wisconsin voters trying to keep themselves and their families healthy and safe. They sided with the gerrymandered Republican legislature that had blocked multiple Democratic attempts to mail ballots to all voters or delay the election until it could be held safely. We’re asking engaged Democrats to take a stand today:

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,FiveThirtyEight: Trump could catch up to Biden,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Democrats across the country have reason for optimism on November 3, despite a string of crushing news over the past two weeks. Recent polling from Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight shows Biden with a 7-point lead over Trump nationally, which is reason to celebrate.
However, FiveThirtyEight’s Geoffrey Skelley and Nathaniel Rakich have pointed out that the race has entered “a traditionally volatile period for presidential campaigns” where we’ll undoubtedly see the Biden-Harris lead shrink.
Donald Trump and Mike Pence can still win \-- especially with a renewed focus on SCOTUS and the recent dismantling of USPS.
This year alone, we’ve seen over 200,000 Americans die during a pandemic that the Trump administration has failed to take seriously, people of color continue to be targeted by police brutality, and this administration’s choice to ignore the will of the people to push through a successor for RBG.
All because 100 million voters stayed home on Election Day in 2016.
The choice is yours: stay home and risk another 4 years of Donald Trump and Mike Pence, or go out to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to bring urgently needed change to the White House. Our outreach plan for this “volatile period” is well underway, and it requires that we have the most up-to-date data possible. That’s why we need you to update your November election plans NOW:
Do you support Biden-Harris?
YES NO
We cannot win without your input, so thank you for your participation.

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Trump continues war on mail-in voting,"When Democrats Turn Out
Hi Alex,
Donald Trump is working hard to disrupt mail-in voting this November.
A record 76 percent of Americans can vote by mail this fall \-- which spells trouble for Trump. Thanks to mail-in voting, election experts expect record participation this November.
But Trump needs to keep turnout low. He won in 2016 due to low turnout, and knows his 2020 chances ride on keeping voters unable to participate.
Trump sabotaged the USPS to slow down mail delivery and disrupt mail-in voting this fall.
Thanks to a $20 million war chest set up by the GOP, Trump is now taking his war against the American voter to the court system.
Since the COVID crisis began, Trump has sued states such as California, Nevada, and New Jersey to stop their universal mail-in voting programs.
Donald Trump knows strong turnout will lead to his defeat in November. It’s little wonder then that despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary, Trump keeps on attacking mail-in voting.
Though Trump continues to rail against mail-in voting, most Americans support it. Are you one of the nearly 60 percent of Americans who support mail-in voting? Let us know now:
Do you support mail-in voting?
YES NO
We cannot win without your input now.

Hello Alex,
Nearly 14 million households have yet to be counted in this year’s census \-- and the Census Bureau has less than two weeks to reach out to them before the Trump administration’s rushed September 30 deadline.
The census count provides crucial information that helps determine how congressional districts are drawn, how $1.5 trillion in federal funding is distributed, and how many Electoral College votes each state gets. The information it provides will impact American lives for the next decade.
The Democratic House passed a bill in May to extend the census deadline to ensure an accurate and representative count during the coronavirus pandemic \-- but Republicans blocked the legislation in the Senate, and the Trump administration later decided to cut the count a month short to create what the Census Bureau is calling a “highly compressed timeline.”
After his unsuccessful attempts to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census and add citizenship status to the list of questions, Trump is now rushing a critical nonpartisan step in our democracy to erase entire communities from the political map.
We refuse to allow Trump to destroy yet another pillar of our democracy for political gain. The Trump administration must reverse its decision and extend this year’s census to ensure every person is counted.
Alex, if you’re with us, add your name to this critical nationwide petition to send a message to Trump that he CANNOT cut the census count short. We have less than two weeks to go before the current deadline, and we DEMAND representation for every community. If you stand with us, please add your name to ours now.
Thank you for joining us in the fight against Trump’s tyranny.

Alex,
Today, we’re proud to spotlight our choice to represent Texas’s 24th Congressional District, Candace Valenzuela.
When Democrats Turn Out endorses Candace Valenzuela, Democratic candidate for Texas's 24th Congressional District
Candace will be a fierce advocate for Texas families and believes strongly in the power of a good education, affordable health care, and adequate housing for all. If elected, she would be the first Black Latina in the U.S. Congress.
A childhood of poverty and homelessness helped shape Candace’s progressive values. She overcame this adversity to become a respected educator and, since 2017, a member of the Carrollton-Farmers Branch Independent School District Board.
Her advocacy for working Texans has earned Candace the endorsements of Democratic leaders such as Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, former 2020 presidential candidate Julián Castro, and Representatives John Lewis, Katie Porter, and Ayanna Pressley.
The race for Texas’s 24th Congressional District is wide open, as long-time GOP incumbent Kenny Marchant is stepping down. Candace is currently locked in a fierce runoff \-- and in the general election Candace will face Beth Van Duyne, a GOP candidate endorsed by Donald Trump.
This is a key battleground district that Democrats are looking to flip blue. That’s why -- if you care about reversing the worst of the damage the GOP has done to our country -- we’re urging you to support Candace and our efforts to elect Democrats up and down the ballot across the country. Will you give anything, even just $5, today?
Thank you for taking a stand.

Trump has named top donor Louis DeJoy to head the U.S. Postal Service. DeJoy, who’s been handling fundraising for this year’s Republican National Convention, “will be the first postmaster general in two decades who did not rise through the agency’s ranks,” according to The Washington Post.
USPS’s 600,000+ employees bring crucial correspondence, life saving medicine, and vote-by-mail ballots to millions of Americans regardless of their geography or their income. The agency has existed since 1775 under Postmaster General Ben Franklin.
But USPS doesn’t receive direct taxpayer assistance \-- and under Republican rule, it will be bankrupt by September. Trump says it’s the USPS’ fault for not charging enough for packages.

This time in 2016, Hillary Clinton was leading Donald Trump in a Fox News voter enthusiasm poll by almost 10 points. Fast forward to 2020 -- and Joe Biden is trailing Trump by 16.
If Trump’s diehard base of loyalists gives him another four years in the Oval Office, he’ll have free rein to enact the worst of his reelection campaign promises. And if Mitch McConnell keeps the Senate, he’ll keep blocking any effort by Democrats in the House to help everyday Americans -- and he is likely to add another 400 bills to his “legislative graveyard,” as he’s so proudly done in the past few years.
In 2018, we proved that we can win. Our victory took back the House -- and we know that now is the time to build on our momentum and take back the White House, too. We’re working hard to protect our elections from Republican attacks by getting as many Democrats as possible to turn out to vote safely in 2020. We know we’ll need a massive blue wave to stop the rising red tide.
But Trump and the RNC have raised over $1 billion to defeat Democrats and suppress voters ahead of November. They have allies in Big Oil, Big Pharma, and the Big Banks. Incumbents usually win reelection, precisely because of how much power they wield and how many allies they have on their side.
It’s all the more reason that we cannot miss ANY of our fundraising goals.
But right now, we’re falling behind.
Our work is 100% funded by thousands of grassroots supporters across the country: Democrats like you who care about the future of our country.

Democrats will take bold action on climate change, expanding green jobs, and putting Americans back to work in a new green economy. Democrats will put a stop to the horrendous practice of putting immigrant children in cages and reopen our country with a fair immigration policy. And we’ll expand and protect access to Medicare and Social Security for our seniors and future generations.
But the GOP will stop at nothing to suppress Democratic voters. Thousands of voters FAILED to even get their absentee ballots in the recent primaries, and Donald Trump knows that the only way for him to win is to suppress the votes of Democrats in November.
We’re doing everything we can to fight back. But right now, we’re falling VERY SHORT of our fundraising goals.
If we don’t raise another $1,130 by midnight tonight, we’ll have to scale back our work turning out voters who are committed to beat Trump. We’ll have to cut support to Senate and House races around the country. If we fail, Trump will win 4 more years in the White House. The GOP and Mitch McConnell will keep control of the Senate. Trump will nominate 2 or more Supreme Court Justices. With the Supreme Court stacked with conservatives, the court could roll back access to choice for millions of women, roll back LGBTQ+ anti-discrimination laws, and repeal Obamacare.
That’s why we need every single committed Democrat to step up right now. Please, we’re asking you to donate now to beat Trump, take back the Senate, and protect the Democratic House majority. With YOUR support right now, Democrats will win, and Trump will be thrown from the White House in the biggest embarrassment of his lifetime.
We cannot thank you enough for all you’re doing every single day to elect Democrats.

Alex,
A survey from Hart Research Associates shows that Joe Biden now leads Donald Trump decisively in six key swing states: Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Montana, and North Carolina.
Those states also all happen to have vulnerable Republican senators whose terms are almost up \-- and the most recent data confirms that Democratic challengers are leading those races, too.
It’s thrilling news and a much-needed breath of fresh air. But it’s also a dangerously familiar feeling of false comfort \-- and according to CNN, “an average of recent polls finds that a majority of voters (about 55%) believe that Trump will defeat Biden in the election.”
It looks like Americans remember 2016 well and aren’t yet convinced Trump won’t pull off another upset. With so much confidence in Trump’s ability to beat the odds, we need a clear message from engaged Democrats \-- tell us now:

Alex,
Republicans praised Amy Coney Barrett for showing up to her SCOTUS confirmation hearings without notes. But maybe she shouldn’t have shown up empty-handed after all, considering she couldn’t name all five freedoms protected by the First Amendment when asked.
Which freedom did she forget, you may ask? That little one known as the right to petition the government \-- in other words, the right to protest.
If that glaring omission doesn’t scare you, it should. But that’s not the only unsettling aspect of a Barrett court. As Trump’s latest far-right justice, Barrett’s legal track record includes ruling against reproductive health care and immigrant rights \-- and she has brazenly criticized the Supreme Court for upholding the Affordable Care Act, an Obama-era policy that has made health care more affordable for millions of Americans.
With Barrett officially confirmed by the Senate, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dying wish has gone unfulfilled, and Democrats are increasingly calling to expand the Supreme Court to counteract the Republican power grab. But 51% of Americans wanted Barrett to fill Ginsburg’s empty seat, and today, we NEED to know if you’re one of them. So tell us now:
Do you approve of Amy Coney Barrett?

The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, one of the last untouched patches of wilderness on our planet, is home to countless grizzly bears, polar bears, caribou, gray wolves, and is “one of the few landscapes still safeguarded and sustainably used by its original indigenous inhabitants,” according to the managing director of the Alaskan Arctic Institute.
But the Trump administration is finalizing plans to open up these federally protected lands to oil and gas companies \-- a move that would further worsen the climate crisis globally and in Alaska. Scientific American found that oil and gas drilling on the refuge could lead to species extinctions and release as many as 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.
Despite facing lawsuits from environmental groups and the native Gwich’in tribe, Trump’s Secretary of the Interior is already preparing land leases and has said there could be a sale to energy companies by the end of the year.
Alex, if you care about protecting the last of the untouched wilderness in our country, we must act NOW. We refuse to see native species and Indigenous populations destroyed by Republican greed; oil and gas companies have no place on our public lands. If you agree, add your name now to demand the Trump administration abandon its plans to deplete the Alaskan refuge.

Trump is now encouraging his supporters to vote twice in his latest attempt to sabotage the presidential election.
For months, Trump has been attacking mail-in voting, falsely claiming it will lead to widespread voter fraud in an effort to suppress the vote \-- and now, he has ordered his supporters in North Carolina to “test” their state’s voting system by casting a ballot for him \-- twice.
Republicans are being encouraged to commit voter fraud by submitting a mail-in ballot AND going to the polls in person. Meanwhile, a growing majority of Democrats say they will be casting their single vote by mail, while concerns grow every day about our mailing system’s ability to count every vote \-- especially with Trump’s favorite crony Louis DeJoy running the USPS into the ground.

155 years ago today, freedom came to the last enslaved African Americans in the state of Texas.
June 19, 1865 \-- the day that’s come to be known as Juneteenth \-- marked the end of a long struggle to abolish the original sin of the United States of America.
And marks the beginning of the struggle to atone for it.
A century and a half later, that struggle rages on. Over the years, the spirit of racial justice, human rights, and equality for all has moved through countless champions and defenders \-- myriad martyrs and icons who were prepared to give their lives (and often did) to ensure that the promise of freedom made so many decades ago might finally see fruition.
Today, that spirit has a new champion with an eternal message: the Black Lives Matter movement.
BLM \-- a coalition of Black activist groups and their allies formed after the murder of Trayvon Martin in 2013 \-- has become a global beacon of hope and empowerment for people of color everywhere. It has similarly served as a powerful warning to their detractors.
BLM has chased corrupt prosecutors out of office. They’ve denied re-election to the allies of hate \-- like the FL state attorney who oversaw the acquittal of Martin’s murderer. And they’ve pressured the Department of Justice to finally release reports on the extent of police corruption in American cities \-- policing the police, at a time when America needs just oversight more than ever.
So, on the anniversary of today’s historic occasion, we ask you to help BLM build a future that’s worth celebrating.

Democrats are turning out to vote in record-breaking numbers to end Donald Trump’s assault on our democracy \-- but we can’t afford to get comfortable. Polling trends across the country show that Republicans, especially “silent voters,” will likely wait until Election Day to cast their ballots for Donald Trump, threatening Joe Biden’s current leads.
Hillary Clinton was heavily favored to win during this time in 2016, just as Biden is favored now. Clinton also held strong leads in national polls and in most battleground states heading into the election \-- and her supporters and financial backers were so confident in Clinton’s success that they redirected millions of dollars in funding to other races while millions of Americans didn’t even cast their ballots.
This is a crucial moment for the future of our country, and we need to ensure that every single eligible voter turns in their ballot. We know that we will need a massive voter turnout in 2020 to prevent Donald Trump from stealing this election and solidifying his far-right control for another four years \-- or more given his current threats.

Hi Alex,
Trump recently installed top Republican donor Louis DeJoy as Postmaster General.
DeJoy has implemented changes to the agency, including ending overtime and delaying mail delivery.
Mark Dimonadstein, head of the American Postal Workers Union, believes these moves are the first step in the Trump administration’s push to privatize the agency.
Worst yet, delayed service now puts mail-in voting \-- and the 2020 election \-- at risk of interference by the Trump administration.
House Democrats and voting rights experts have sounded the alarm, believing delays would severely hamper the ability to have mail-in voting for the 2020 election.

So far, that strategy includes forcing Wisconsinites to stand in long lines to vote even after pleas for a delay, suing to stop ballot deadline extensions, and trying to do what they did in Wisconsin in other states, like Michigan, Minnesota, and New Mexico.
It’s easy to see why their strategy is effective -- though the president has claimed voter fraud as his excuse for hating mail-in voting in the past, on Fox & Friends recently, he admitted the truth, “if you ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.”

Alex,
Axios News has reported it’s likely Trump will win in a landslide on election night -- or at least appear to, until all the mail-in ballots are counted over the ensuing days and weeks.
Trump will use that opportunity to try to cling to power, building on the foundation he’s laid through casting doubt on vote-by-mail, accusing Democrats of rigging the election, and toying with the idea of disputing the results if Biden wins.
That means the stakes of beating Trump in 2020 have never been higher -- both on election night, and in the days and weeks that follow.
And it means we cannot stop the important work we’re doing to lock down a Democratic Congress, which would be all the more crucial in a second Trump term. We’re proud to have already endorsed and supported 21 Democrats in the House and the Senate -- Democrats who are well on their way to victory because of supporters like you. We now need to redouble our outreach efforts -- to voters in battlegrounds like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania and across the country -- and compel Americans to cast their ballots in the most important election of our lifetimes.
We know Republicans will do anything to suppress the vote, legally or otherwise, with their piles of dark money and Trump campaign funds. And we know voter burnout is just as much of a threat as the GOP -- it feels like this election cycle has been going on forever.
But it won’t last forever. It’s now October, we’ve got just over 4 weeks until the biggest election of our lives -- and we’re being outspent. If we don’t turn this around quickly, we’ll have to scale back, which means turning out fewer Democratic votes and giving Republicans a chance to reclaim the House, hold onto the Senate, and keep the White House.
We need to show up in full force this election. That’s why we’re writing to you -- we know the future of this country weighs heavily on your mind. We hope you’ll help us move this country onto the right path forward.
If you believe in protecting our democracy, we need you now. If you believe in stopping Trump’s destruction of America, we need you now. If you believe in fighting back against GOP voter suppression, we need you now. Please, help us turn out the vote and get Trump out of the White House by giving whatever you can today.

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Trump moves to weaken DACA -- against objections of Supreme Court,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Donald Trump is now openly defying the highest court in the land \-- the Supreme Court.
In June, the Supreme Court halted President Trump’s attempt to end the DACA program. The Trump administration was later ordered by a federal judge to start accepting DACA applications and give Dreamers the standard two year deportation protection to stay in the country.
But Trump is now openly abandoning that order. His administration announced that they will no longer accept applications and only give deportation protection to applicants for one year.
Trump is so hellbent on targeting immigrants that he is willing to disregard the Supreme Court.
Immigration experts fear Trump is trying to stall for time \-- as he comes up with a legal plan to end DACA after his potential re-election.
We cannot stand for this. For the sake of Dreamers, we need to come out in November and vote to oust Donald Trump.
Join us and stand up for Dreamers right now:

Republicans just can’t figure out why they’re having such rotten luck.
With Donald Trump’s approval cratering \-- and taking vulnerable GOP senators down with him \-- congressional Republicans are scratching their head about what they did to deserve all this.

According to POLITICO, Senator Bernie Sanders is now working to join Joe Biden’s potential presidential cabinet as the next Secretary of Labor.
Senator Sanders has rallied behind Biden throughout this election cycle, campaigning on his behalf in battleground states, urging progressive voters to support Biden at the polls, and collaborating with the Biden campaign to create “unity task forces” that provide recommendations on our most pressing issues including health care and climate change.
Biden has made labor and the middle class a priority throughout his campaign, and now Senator Sanders is hoping to bring his decades of experience championing laws to raise the minimum wage, protect and expand labor rights, and support workers unions to the Biden administration.
Senator Sanders can help Joe Biden rebuild our economy in a way that benefits working Americans after the coronavirus pandemic, but Biden’s team is already considering other potential moderate or Republican candidates for the position. Some say that Senator Sanders should remain “a lone ranger,” excluded from the next administration \-- but today we need to know where supporters like YOU stand on Biden’s upcoming cabinet:

Alex,
Donald Trump’s so-called “Army for Trump” \-- his dubious poll-watching program meant to monitor election sites and catch supposed fraud \-- is swiftly growing in strength as Republicans nationwide urgently work to recruit their goal of 50,000 troops.
Trump’s efforts to erode the public’s confidence in a free and fair election has been months in the making, and his family has also recently joined the fray: An “Army for Trump” recruitment video \-- broadcasted to his 87 million Twitter followers \-- features Don Jr. spewing lies about the DNC’s plan to rig the election by “adding millions of fraudulent ballots.”
But if Democrats overwhelmingly turn up to the polls, especially in swing states, it'll be nearly impossible for Trump to contest the election. And things are already looking good: In Florida, 2.5 million Democrats have requested mail ballots as opposed to 1.7 million Republicans. In Pennsylvania, Democrats have nearly tripled the requests for such ballots compared to Republicans.
Still, Trump’s monitors are armed with cell phones and are eager to capture and contest every step of the voting process. As a Republican Party leader in Pennsylvania predicts, “There’s going to be lots of watchers, lots of cameras, and lots of attorneys all across the country. It’s going to be chaotic.”
To fight this battle, we need to further mobilize to protect our voting rights and ensure that every eligible voter turns in their ballot this November. But Alex \-- right now we’re desperately low on the funds we need to expand our efforts.
You more than anyone know what’s at stake in this election. Donald Trump’s presidency has brought us to the brink of authoritarianism -- and the chance to save our democracy won’t come again for another four years. Alex, will you pitch in now to turn out every single eligible Democrat in November and remove a wannabe tyrant from the White House, expand our House majority, and take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell’s grasp?

However, FiveThirtyEight’s Geoffrey Skelley and Nathaniel Rakich were quick to point out that the race is entering “a traditionally volatile period for presidential campaigns” and that the Biden-Harris lead would undoubtedly shrink.
Donald Trump and Mike Pence can still win \-- just as they were able to overcome Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine’s sizable polling leads in 2016.

All because 100 million voters stayed home on Election Day in 2016.
The choice is yours: stay home and risk another 4 years of Donald Trump and Mike Pence, or go out to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, bringing much needed change to the White House. We’re trying to craft our strategy to reach Democratic voters before November, but we don’t have enough data yet. That’s why we need you to update your November election plans NOW:

If we stay on our current course, in 30 years the ocean will have more plastic in it than fish.
That won’t just destroy marine life. It will have irreparable harm on human health \-- as toxins leach from our waste into the food chain. Increased risks of cancer, birth defects, immunodeficiencies, and impaired childhood development will follow as the poison we put in the planet’s seas makes its way back onto our plate.
Democrats in Congress have proposed a solution: The Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act. The bill would halt construction of more plastic production plants until the EPA has a chance to assess the damage already done. Then, the healing would begin \-- as single-use plastics would slowly be phased out starting in 2022.
And finally, the big corporations who allowed so much plastic into our oceans in the first place will have to pay the price, as the legislation would make them responsible for cleaning up the mess they created.
Right now, the bill has not made it past “Grim Reaper” Mitch McConnell and his legislative graveyard. That’s why we’re asking for a grassroots push.
If you agree that we need to protect the health of ourselves and our planet, if you agree we can’t let corporations pollute our oceans scot-free, and if you agree that Trump and Republicans can no longer ignore climate science while rewarding big polluters, add your name to ours and demand Congress take action now!

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,"Early signs of a ""blue wave""","When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Great news for Democrats hoping for a “blue wave” in November \-- June’s primary elections gave us a glimpse of a potential liberal landslide.
The New York Times reports that, “a determined electorate pushed turnout past 2016 levels in nearly all of the eight states that held primary contests” this month. The winners of that spike in voter participation were largely women of color, who came out on top in several races \-- women like Ella Jones, who is now Ferguson’s first African-American mayor-elect. The losers? White nationalists like Iowa’s Steve King, who voters soundly rejected at the polls.
Barack Obama called the results “a reminder of the difference politics and voting can make in changing who has the power to make real change.” But the progressive leaders who won this month already have a tough battle ahead in November \-- and the fight will be far tougher if Republicans succeed in restricting voting rights even further. Tell us now if you’ll commit to making real change with us:
Will you vote this November?
YES NO

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,How you can help Democrats defeat Trump in November,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Right now, things look bad for Donald Trump. Polls show Joe Biden with a large lead in the general election. Trump’s approval rating is hovering at around 40 percent due to his poor handling of the COVID-19 crisis. Even some of his closest allies, such as South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, have begun to speak out against his mishandling of the pandemic.
But things also looked bleak for Donald Trump in 2016. Hillary Clinton led by double digits in polls and, according to Gallup, Trump was the most unpopular major party candidate in presidential election history.
Yet, Trump won \-- because 100 million Americans stayed home on Election Day. Low turnout handed Trump the White House and returned Mitch McConnell to the Senate. And it could happen again in 2020.
As Rolling Stone reported, Donald Trump and the GOP will do anything in their power to suppress Democratic votes this year and keep Trump in the White House \-- even if it means “Blocking ballots, intimidating voters, spreading misinformation.”
For the sake of our democracy, we need to fight back \-- RIGHT NOW. Our mission is to turn out every single eligible Democratic voter in the country and defeat Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell.
If Democrats control Washington, we’ll expand health care access to every single American in this country. Democrats will take bold action on climate change by expanding green jobs and putting Americans back to work in a new eco-friendly economy. Democrats will stop the horrendous practice of putting immigrant children in cages and reopen our country with a fair immigration policy. And we’ll expand and protect access to Medicare and Social Security for our seniors and future generations.
But these changes can only happen if we win on Election Day. The GOP will stop at nothing to suppress Democratic voters. We need to mobilize and organize voters TODAY to ensure we win in November. But right now, we’re falling VERY SHORT of our fundraising goals.
If we don’t raise another $1,650 by midnight tonight, we won’t be able to reach voters in key battleground states. If we fail, Trump will win 4 more years in the White House, the GOP and Mitch McConnell will keep control of the Senate, and Trump will nominate 2 \-- or more \-- Supreme Court justices. When the Supreme Court is stacked with conservatives, they will be free to roll back access to reproductive freedom, weaken LGBTQ+ anti-discrimination laws, and repeal Obamacare.
We want to make this crystal clear \-- the future of our democracy is at stake in this election. That’s why we need every single committed Democrat to step up right now. Please, we’re asking you to donate now to beat Trump, take back the Senate, and protect the Democratic House majority. With YOUR support right now, Democrats can oust Donald Trump from the White House.

Alex,
Late Friday night, Donald Trump fired State Department Inspector General Steve Linick.
Linick, an Obama appointee, was doing his job and investigating Mike Pompeo \-- Trump’s Secretary of State \-- for inappropriate behavior. Pompeo would apparently rather not answer questions about whether he was sending a political appointee to perform personal errands like walking his dog and picking up his dry cleaning. It’s not the first time Pompeo has been investigated for this sort of misconduct.
But rather than cooperate with the investigation, Pompeo suggested Trump fire Linick \-- and Trump did.
Now House Democrats led by Nancy Pelosi are saying the firing could be an act of unlawful retaliation and have called for the White House to turn over its records on the incident. But CNN reports that chances of stopping the firing “appear slim given the fact that Trump has now fired multiple inspectors general following his Senate acquittal in early February,” and goes on to say that “the President has long been fixated on ridding his administration of government watchdogs he views as Obama loyalists and now appears to be working toward achieving that goal.”
With the White House fighting Congress’s ability to hold this administration accountable for their corruption, it’s up to the American people to provide the kind of oversight Trump is so afraid of. Tell us now:

Donald Trump is pushing to release a COVID-19 vaccine before the November election \-- despite opposition from his own top scientists. And now, a major vaccine trial has been put on hold after a participant developed symptoms of an “unexplained illness,” confirming fears of bypassed safety measures.
Kamala Harris warned Americans not to trust Donald Trump’s vaccine promise. She has urged them to wait for a credible source that confirms the efficacy and reliability of the vaccine before putting themselves at risk.
But Trump is willing to risk the health of millions of Americans to give himself an ego boost and attract voters with a false sense of accomplishment. He attacked Harris’s warnings as “sabotage,” brushing off evidence that the vaccine could cause unknown side effects for Americans who use it.
Kamala Harris is ready to protect Americans from Donald Trump’s blatant disregard for science. Are you ready to fight alongside her as Democrats attempt to take back the White House and Senate? We’re preparing our efforts to get Democrats to the polls this fall, but we need to hear from you. Let us know now if you support our vice presidential candidate:

Hi Alex,
Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos want to send kids back to school this month \-- without a plan to keep them safe.
This administration’s appalling lack of leadership during the COVID-19 crisis has already caused the deaths of over 150,000 people. Now, Trump and his allies are putting millions of children, their teachers, and their families at risk.
In their rush to reopen schools, the Trump administration has ignored scientific evidence that opening schools too soon is a dangerous idea. Trump’s press secretary Kayleigh McEnany even said: “Science should not stand in the way of schools reopening.” As if our children’s lives don’t matter.
Once again, the Trump administration is refusing to acknowledge scientific fact and is willingingly putting American lives at risk to advance a dangerous agenda.
This November, we MUST elect more leaders who believe in science and care about the health of Americans. Part of our 2020 strategy is to turn out every Democratic voter so we can stop Trump’s self-serving agenda and protect the American people. We need to know where you stand today:
Do you feel safe having children return to school this month?

With the election only 3 days away, discussions regarding Joe Biden’s potential cabinet picks are in full swing \-- and according to POLITICO, more Republicans are among them than you might expect.
Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Quibi CEO Meg Whitman are among the candidates whose names are being floated for top positions. POLITICO notes that “reaching across the aisle to pick senior members of his administration could shore up Biden’s credentials as a unity candidate, a message he’s made a cornerstone of his campaign.” Many past presidents have done so \-- but the practice ended with the Trump administration.
A spokesperson for the Biden transition team has provided a possible explanation for the conservative considerations, saying that “diversity of ideology and background is a core value of the transition.”
The question is: Do the American people support diversity of thought to THIS extent in an administration that’ll be charged with healing the country from the havoc wreaked by Trump and his GOP cronies? Add your voice to the mix now:
Are you in favor of John Kasich having a position in the Biden administration?

Senator Sanders has rallied behind Biden throughout this election cycle, campaigning on his behalf in battleground states, urging progressive voters to support Biden at the polls, and collaborating with the Biden campaign to create “unity task forces” that provide recommendations on our most pressing issues, including health care and climate change.
Biden has made labor and the middle class a priority throughout his campaign, and now Senator Sanders is hoping to bring his decades of experience championing laws to raise the minimum wage, protect and expand labor rights, and support workers' unions to the Biden administration.

Four more years of Trump and Pence would mean more kids in cages, the end of Obamacare, the destruction of Social Security and Medicare, further isolation of the United States on the world stage, and the continued rule of an increasingly authoritarian president hellbent on punishing political opponents.

McConnell has drawn a “red line” on relief money for struggling states and families. Instead, he’s using the current crisis to pack the courts with as many Trump loyalist judges as possible.
According to The New York Times, while the Democrat-controlled House is in recess on the advice of Congress’s attending physician, Republicans have bucked health guidelines to hold a meeting on making McConnell’s personal protege an appeals court judge.
McConnell knows that if Democrats take back the Senate, he’ll lose his chance to pack the courts with his cronies. So he’s trying to get as many judges as possible in under the wire, during a pandemic. We want to draw a “red line” of our own against Mitch’s selfish and dangerous nepotism, so please tell us now:
Do you approve of Mitch McConnell?
YES NO

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Today's the start of a new SCOTUS term,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Today’s the first day of the new Supreme Court term \-- and it’s the first time in nearly three decades the high court will convene without the trailblazing Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Without her expertise and voice of reason on the court, we will have one less vote on our side. That means healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights, and a fair presidential election are all on the line.
And Trump and the GOP are dead set on stealing another Supreme Court seat by pushing through Judge Amy Coney Barret’s confirmation in record time. Her vote will mean limiting healthcare access, stripping nondiscrimination protections from LGBTQ+ folks, and ushering in Trump’s second term against the will of the people.
But recent polling is tipping the scales in our favor: Biden has a 77% chance of winning the presidency and Democrats have a 62% likelihood of retaking the Senate. Retaking the executive and legislative branches is the advantage we need to protect Americans and their rights even with the possibility of a more hostile court. This is the security that we need and our strongest barrier to the GOP’s evil agenda.
But Trump’s base \-- nearly half the country \-- remains staunchly behind him. And Mitch McConnell and the GOP Senate are doing everything in their power to steal this election, whether that’s an influx of dark money from billionaires and special interest groups or using the dirty tricks from their voter suppression playbook.
The makeup of the Supreme Court is already unstable, and we just can’t afford a GOP takeover in Congress and the Oval Office too. That would mean the stripping of civil liberties across the board. Our children and grandchildren will live with fewer rights in an unrecognizable America. To fight off the GOP’s swell of donations, we need all the support we can get \-- but currently, we are $7,076 short of where we need to be.
Please, Alex -- with an at-risk Supreme Court beginning its new term, we need your help more than ever. It’s imperative that we quickly close our fundraising gap -- otherwise, the GOP may very well cruise through Election Day. Any and all support TODAY will go a long way in stopping Republicans in their tracks and helping Democrats get elected nationwide.

Alex,
We now know the 2020 Democratic ticket: Senator Kamala Harris of California will be Joe Biden’s running mate this fall.
We couldn’t be more excited about this pick. Senator Harris will be the first Black and first AAPI woman on a major presidential ticket. And she has a great track record of pushing for racial justice, protecting women and children from abuse and neglect, and speaking out against Donald Trump.
But while we’re excited about the ticket, we also know that Donald Trump and Mike Pence will stop at nothing to get re-elected \-- and are already in the process of dismantling the U.S. Postal Service to slow mail-in voting this fall.
And we know that 100 million voters stayed home on Election Day in 2016 \-- effectively handing over the White House to Trump and Pence.
The choice in November is now set: Biden-Harris or four more years of the corrupt, anti-science, and anti-democratic Trump-Pence administration.
We need every single committed Democrat to show up to the polls this November so we can reclaim the White House \-- and protect our democracy. Can we count on you to support the Biden-Harris ticket? Let us know now:

Voting Count Alert,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Building up our voting lead against Donald Trump,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
According to The Independent, as of Saturday, 25 million Americans had already voted in the 2020 general election – and in the 15 states that provide voters’ party affiliations, Democrats have turned in more than twice as many ballots. And Democrats are leading in Florida -- 1.1 million to 726,000.
Democrats are turning out to vote in record-breaking numbers to end Donald Trump’s assault on our democracy \-- but we can’t afford to get comfortable. Polling trends across the country show that Republicans, especially “silent voters,” will likely wait until Election Day to cast their ballots for Donald Trump, threatening Joe Biden’s current leads.
Hillary Clinton was heavily favored to win during this time in 2016, just as Biden is favored now. Clinton also held strong leads in national polls and in most battleground states heading into the election \-- and her supporters and financial backers were so confident in Clinton’s success that they redirected millions of dollars in funding to other races while millions of Americans didn’t even cast their ballots.
This is a crucial moment for the future of our country, and we need to ensure that every single eligible voter turns in their ballot. We know that we will need a massive voter turnout in 2020 to prevent Donald Trump from stealing this election and solidifying his far-right control for another four years \-- or more given his current threats. The stakes are too high to sit this election out. That’s why we need to know:

Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York has shown he’s not afraid of Donald Trump. He called out Trump’s claim that accountability for the pandemic lies with state governors, pointing out how unfair it is for the president to blame state governments without sending them federal relief money.
Or, as Cuomo put it to Trump, “Don’t pass the buck without passing the bucks.”
But when it came time to move beyond Trump’s partisan politics for the sake of public health, Cuomo didn’t disappoint, coordinating with the president to work toward doubling testing efforts. Just this week, Cuomo visited the White House to meet with Trump on infrastructure investments and how best to “supercharge” the recovery.
And, perhaps to the president’s chagrin, Cuomo wore a mask on the way there.

Hi Alex,
Add South Carolina Senator Linsdey Graham to the growing list of Republicans looking to restrict voting rights this fall by attacking mail-in voting.
Graham claims a national mail-in voting plan would lead to “ballot security and fraud issues.”
However, Graham has no problems personally using mail-in voting. Salon points out Graham “has voted by mail at least four times” since 2004.
Taking a cue from his best friend Donald Trump, Graham is trying to restrict the vote as his race for re-election tightens up.
According to The Cook Political Report, a Jaime Harrison upset of Graham in the race for South Carolina’s Senate seat is “is no longer a long-shot.”
Cook moved the race from “Likely to Lean Republican” \-- reflecting recent polling that shows Harrison and Graham are nearly tied.
Considered a long-shot just last year, Harrison has a real chance to take down Graham, and the desperate incumbent is scrambling to find a way to keep this seat. And he’s not above stooping to voter suppression.
Defeating Graham would almost certainly hand Democrats control of the Senate \-- but we need your continued support to make a Harrison victory a reality. Harrison is surging in the polls because committed Democratic voters are stepping up and donating. Won’t you join them in the fight to take back our democracy? The choice is clear: fresh, new leadership in Harrison, or a candidate labeled “The Most Shameless Man in American Politics” for his support of Donald Trump. Where do you stand? Let us know now:
Do you support Lindsey Graham?
YES NO

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Axios: Trump will likely win a landslide victory on November 3,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Axios News has reported it’s likely Trump will win in a landslide on election night -- or at least appear to, until all the mail-in ballots are counted over the ensuing days and weeks.
Trump will use that opportunity to try to cling to power, building on the foundation he’s laid through casting doubt on vote-by-mail, accusing Democrats of rigging the election, and toying with the idea of disputing the results if Biden wins.
That means the stakes of beating Trump in 2020 have never been higher -- both on election night, and in the days and weeks that follow.
And it means we cannot stop the important work we’re doing to lock down a Democratic Congress, which would be all the more crucial in a second Trump term. We’re proud to have already endorsed and supported 21 Democrats in the House and the Senate -- Democrats who are well on their way to victory because of supporters like you. We now need to redouble our outreach efforts -- to voters in battlegrounds like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania and across the country -- and compel Americans to cast their ballots in the most important election of our lifetimes.
We know Republicans will do anything to suppress the vote, legally or otherwise, with their piles of dark money and Trump campaign funds. And we know voter burnout is just as much of a threat as the GOP -- it feels like this election cycle has been going on forever.
But it won’t last forever. It’s now October, we’ve got just over 4 weeks until the biggest election of our lives -- and we’re being outspent. If we don’t turn this around quickly, we’ll have to scale back, which means turning out fewer Democratic votes and giving Republicans a chance to reclaim the House, hold onto the Senate, and keep the White House.
We need to show up in full force this election. That’s why we’re writing to you -- we know the future of this country weighs heavily on your mind. We hope you’ll help us move this country onto the right path forward.
If you believe in protecting our democracy, we need you now. If you believe in stopping Trump’s destruction of America, we need you now. If you believe in fighting back against GOP voter suppression, we need you now. Please, help us turn out the vote and get Trump out of the White House by giving whatever you can today.

Electoral Protection Action,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Trump's trusty law to steal the election,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
The Atlantic has sounded the alarm on an obscure law Donald Trump could use to steal the election.
Trump has already openly admitted he plans to suppress the vote and use his far-right Supreme Court majority to keep his grasp on power. But he hasn’t been as eager to disclose that, under the Electoral Count Act, Trump can use Republican-held state legislatures to block electoral votes for Joe Biden, triggering a stalemate.
In that case, the election would be decided by a vote of state delegations in the newly elected House of Representatives in 2021 \-- and since we currently hold a Democratic majority in the House but not a majority of state delegations, Republicans in Congress could hand Trump the White House, even if he loses the election.
We can preemptively block Trump’s imminent ploy by voting in overwhelming numbers this November. If we turn out to defend and expand our House majority, especially in key states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Florida, we would secure the state delegations we need to leave Trump with no choice but to respect the will of the American people. But The Cook Political Report has categorized over 25 House races as a “toss up,” and congressional races will only get tighter as Election Day nears. Today, we need your commitment to support Democrats and protect our electoral integrity:

Now that they’ve installed their man, the Times reports Republicans, “want to see more documents declassified and released that are related to the Russia investigation opened during the Obama administration.”
That’s right \-- Republicans handpicked a Trump loyalist to lead the intelligence community so that they can continue to feed Trump’s “Obamagate” conspiracy.
It looks like McConnell and his Republican allies see no problem with pandering to Trump’s darkest urges \-- even at the expense of our national intelligence. We can’t block their vote, but we can make our voices heard now \-- tell us:

New polling shows Senator Elizabeth Warren is the most popular choice among Democrats for Biden’s vice president, with POLITICO writing: “Warren (plus-48 percentage points) edges out Harris (44 points) and Klobuchar (38 points) in net favorability.”
On MSNBC, Warren said she’d say “yes” if asked. But other candidates are jockeying for the VP slot, and Trump has repeatedly attacked Warren for being “mean” and has refused to stop calling her “Pocahontas” in the media.

Alex,
There’s been an incredibly tragic, largely unseen consequence of the nationwide lockdown: because children are home more and gun sales are up, the country has seen a spike in unintentional shootings by children in March and April.
It’s an unimaginable scenario \-- but unfortunately, also just more of what we’ve been seeing even before shelter-in-place orders took effect. 4.6 million minors live in homes with unlocked, loaded guns. Now more than ever, it’s time to ensure those children are protected.
Polls show that the vast majority of Americans want a locked gun mandate. But so far, only 11 states have passed any kind of safe storage law. That means, in most of the country, this problem is set to continue or even get worse.
Special interest groups like the NRA shouldn’t get to override the will of the American people and the safety of American children. It’s time for decisive action.
If you agree that we need to protect vulnerable Americans from the scourge of gun violence; if you agree the NRA shouldn’t be able to buy politicians and boss Congress around with their dark money; and if you agree we need to expand protections for at-risk Americans -- especially our children -- then add your name to ours and demand Congress take action now!

AG Barr’s intervention directly undermined our democratic process \-- he sidetracked a jury conviction of seven felony counts and reduced Stone’s sentence to just half of what prosecutors recommended. The charges against Stone included thwarting congressional investigations into the Trump campaign’s collusion with WikiLeaks to release damaging emails against Hillary Clinton.

A tweet from @realDonaldTrump reads ""There is NO WAY \(ZERO!\) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mailboxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged & even illegally printed out & fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone..."" Below Trump's tweet, Twitter has inserted a clickable message written in blue next to an exclamation point that reads ""Get the facts about mail-in ballots""
Source: Twitter
Anyone who clicks “Get the facts about mail-in ballots” is taken to a list of reasons why Trump’s claim is false: like the fact that California is only sending ballots to registered voters, just like several other states \-- and that there’s no link between vote-by-mail and voter fraud.
But while Twitter can call out Trump on his lies, they can’t stop him from destroying vote-by-mail. That’s exactly what Trump is doing now \-- by appointing a top donor and loyalist to head USPS and starving the agency of relief funding. Trump knows if the USPS goes under, so does vote-by-mail.

Obama issued a scathing rebuke of the Department of Justice letting Michael Flynn off ""scot-free,"" even after the disgraced national security advisor pled guilty to lying to the FBI about the Trump campaign's contact with Russia.
Mitch McConnell has attacked Obama for speaking out -- with McConnell saying to Obama ""you had your shot,"" and adding that the former president ""should have kept his mouth shut"" about the administration's corruption.

Alex,
It’s less than 100 days until Election Day \-- and Joe Biden has a double digit lead in the polls.
But Hillary Clinton also had a big lead in 2016 \-- and lost on Election Day.
Winning in November will come down to who votes. But in 2016, nearly 100 million Americans stayed home. Trump won the White House and Mitch McConnell controls the Senate.
Now, a shocking new Rolling Stone exposé details the GOP’s plans to suppress the vote in 2020: “Blocking ballots, intimidating voters, spreading misinformation – undermining democracy is at the heart of Trump’s 2020 campaign.”
Our mission is to turn out every single eligible Democratic voter in the country. And if we do, Trump will be out of the White House, Mitch McConnell will lose control of the Senate, and Democrats will expand our House majority.
If Democrats control Washington, we’ll expand health care access to every single American in this country. Democrats will take bold action on climate change by expanding green jobs and putting Americans back to work in a new green economy. Democrats will put a stop to the horrendous practice of putting immigrant children in cages and reopen our country with a fair immigration policy. And we’ll expand and protect access to Medicare and Social Security for our seniors and future generations.
But the GOP has raised millions in dark money to target Democratic voters \-- as Donald Trump begins to realize that the only way he can win in November is through voter suppression.
We’re doing everything we can to fight back. And unlike the GOP, we’re a grassroots effort relying on donors like you. But right now, we’re falling VERY SHORT of our fundraising goals.
If we don’t raise another $3,200 by midnight tonight, we’ll have to scale back our work turning out voters who are committed to beat Trump. We’ll have to cut support to Senate and House races around the country. If we fail, Trump will win 4 more years in the White House. The GOP and Mitch McConnell will keep control of the Senate. Trump will nominate 2 or more Supreme Court Justices. With the Supreme Court stacked with conservatives, the court could roll back access to choice for millions of women, roll back LGBTQ+ anti-discrimination laws, and repeal Obamacare.
That’s why we need every single committed Democrat to step up right now. Please, we’re asking you to donate now to beat Trump, take back the Senate, and protect the Democratic House majority. With YOUR support right now, Democrats will win, and Trump will be thrown from the White House in the biggest embarrassment of his lifetime.
We cannot thank you enough for all you’re doing every single day to elect Democrats.

Alex,
The good news continues for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. A few weeks ago, the Democratic ticket had the biggest polling lead heading into the party convention since 1996, with a comfortable seven-point lead on Donald Trump and Mike Pence, according to Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight.
However, FiveThirtyEight’s Geoffrey Skelley and Nathaniel Rakich were quick to point out that the race is entering “a traditionally volatile period for presidential campaigns” and that the Biden-Harris lead would undoubtedly shrink.
Donald Trump and Mike Pence can still win \-- just as they were able to overcome Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine’s sizable polling leads in 2016. And since then, we have seen federal law enforcement terrorize American cities, the USPS dismantled for political purposes, and over 180,000 Americans die from a pandemic that the Trump administration failed to take seriously.
All because 100 million voters stayed home on Election Day in 2016.
The choice is yours: stay home and risk another 4 years of Donald Trump and Mike Pence, or go out to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, bringing much needed change to the White House. We’re trying to craft our strategy to reach Democratic voters before November, but we don’t have enough data yet. That’s why we need you to update your November election plans NOW:

This decrease in registration, coupled with the GOP’s continuous attacks on our voting rights, has the potential to reshape our electorate and give Donald Trump another four years in the White House.
That’s why we’re standing with Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Barack Obama, and Elizabeth Warren in their fierce support of Automatic Voter Registration to increase voter turnout and give all Americans an easy way to exercise their right to vote.
But Donald Trump and his Republican allies are working tirelessly to suppress the vote ahead of this election \-- and they’ve shown they will stop at nothing to hold onto power.
Alex, if you care about our democracy and ensuring voters turn out in record-breaking numbers to beat Trump in November, we need you to act NOW. We refuse to stand by as Republicans attack our most basic rights and steal this election. Every American has the right to vote freely and safely, and every vote must be counted.

This year, the federal government is on pace to allocate $6.6 trillion, and Trump has found countless ways to turn that into political benefits for himself \-- putting his name on $290 billion in stimulus checks, running a coronavirus response campaign “to defeat hope and despair,” and promising to give more federal funds to voters \-- especially in critical swing states.
Trump is using the federal government to win this election in unprecedented ways, and if he’s re-elected, he’ll continue to illegally expand executive power.
Our country simply won’t survive another Trump-Pence term. That’s why we’re planning a new engagement strategy to get Democrats to the polls in overwhelming numbers and support Joe Biden and Kamala Harris this November.
But millions of Democratic voters stayed home in 2016 and handed Donald Trump four years in the White House \-- that’s why we need to know where YOU stand now as November approaches:
This November, I will support:
Joe Biden
Donald Trump
Third Party
No one

Alex,
Attorney General Bill Barr has said that, no matter what Donald Trump wants, he won’t use the justice system to organize a show trial for former president Barack Obama \-- with Barr saying, “As long as I’m attorney general, the criminal justice system will not be used for partisan political ends.”
Trump, on the other hand, doubled down on his accusations \-- saying Obama should be made to testify before Congress as part of Trump’s claim that the former president committed “the biggest political crime in American history,” even though Trump can’t say what that crime is.
It looks like, for now, Trump’s cabinet is standing up to him. But the last time an Attorney General wouldn’t go along with Trump’s wishes, Trump fired him and replaced him with someone who would. If Trump does the same thing again, then President Obama could be forced to testify before a GOP-controlled Senate. That’s why we need to know, now:

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris can return true leadership to the White House \-- but only if Democrats show up and vote in November.
Unfortunately, Donald Trump is already making that more difficult. He’s slowed down the U.S. Postal Service to disrupt mail-in voting and Democratic turnout this November.
If re-elected, Trump will destroy Obamacare, end DACA, and add even more hard-right justices to the Supreme Court.
And while Trump is down big in polls, Nate Silver still gives him a 28 percent chance to win \-- roughly the same chance he was given to win the 2016 election.
Michelle Obama is correct: Donald Trump is not fit to be president. But unless Democrats go vote in November \-- he will be around for four more years.

This is terrifying. Donald Trump is openly inciting violence against those he sees as his enemies.
Late last week, Trump posted a video from a supporter on Twitter who declares, “The only good Democrat is a dead Democrat.”
The next day, Trump issued a racially-charged threat against protestors in Minneapolis \-- threatening to deploy the National Guard and telling Americans, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.”
There’s no precedent for the President of the United States promoting violence against political opponents and American citizens, but Trump has been doing this since before he was even elected \-- leading rally crowds in chants of “lock her up” and telling his supporters to “knock the crap out of” protestors who disrupt them.
It’s absolutely unacceptable \-- and so is the fact that 55% of voters forecast Trump will win again in November.

Great news for Democrats hoping for a “blue wave” in November \-- June’s primary elections gave us a glimpse of a potential liberal landslide.
The New York Times reports that, “a determined electorate pushed turnout past 2016 levels in nearly all of the eight states that held primary contests” this month. The winners of that spike in voter participation were largely women of color, who came out on top in several races \-- women like Ella Jones, who is now Ferguson’s first African-American mayor-elect. The losers? White nationalists like Iowa’s Steve King, who voters soundly rejected at the polls.
Barack Obama called the results “a reminder of the difference politics and voting can make in changing who has the power to make real change.” But the progressive leaders who won this month already have a tough battle ahead in November \-- and the fight will be far tougher if Republicans succeed in restricting voting rights even further. Tell us now if you’ll commit to making real change with us:

Tribal communities \-- which are often subject to overcrowding, poor living conditions, and lack of basic utilities like running water \-- were particularly unprepared for the outbreak that’s reached their lands.
So top Democrats, Senator Harris among them, have addressed Senate leadership to plead for emergency funding \-- writing in a joint letter: “We understand that a number of Tribal leaders, urban Indian health program directors, and Native organizations reached out to Congress to express their concerns on this issue, and [[URL REDACTED]] urge you to consider their requests as you work on the next COVID-19 package.”
But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already dismissed the idea of more aid out of hand and has called support for local governments a “blue state bailout” \-- to say nothing of what he might think of supporting Americans who are about as far removed from his constituency as you can get.
We can’t let tribal communities suffer because of the selfishness of McConnell and Republicans. Please join the fight to save some of the most threatened among us, tell us now:

Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Quibi CEO Meg Whitman are among the candidates whose names are being floated for top positions.

It’s less than 100 days until Election Day \-- and Joe Biden has a double digit lead in the polls.
But Hillary Clinton also had a big lead in 2016 \-- and lost on Election Day.
Winning in November will come down to who votes. But in 2016, nearly 100 million Americans stayed home. Trump won the White House while Mitch McConnell maintained control of the Senate.
Now, a shocking new Rolling Stone exposé details the GOP’s plans to suppress the vote in 2020: “Blocking ballots, intimidating voters, spreading misinformation – undermining democracy is at the heart of Trump’s 2020 campaign.”
Our mission is to turn out every single eligible Democratic voter in the country. And if we do, Trump will be out of the White House, Mitch McConnell will lose control of the Senate, and Democrats will expand our House majority.
If Democrats control Washington, we’ll expand health care access to every single American in this country. Democrats will take bold action on climate change by expanding green jobs and putting Americans back to work in a new green economy. Democrats will put a stop to the horrendous practice of putting immigrant children in cages and reopen our country with a fair immigration policy. And we’ll expand and protect access to Medicare and Social Security for our seniors and future generations.
But the GOP has raised millions in dark money to target Democratic voters \-- as Donald Trump begins to realize that the only way he can win in November is through voter suppression.
We’re doing everything we can to fight back. And unlike the GOP, we’re a grassroots effort relying on donors like you. But right now, we’re falling VERY SHORT of our fundraising goals.
If we don’t raise another $3,200 by midnight tonight, we’ll have to scale back our work turning out voters who are committed to beat Trump. We’ll have to cut support to Senate and House races around the country. If we fail, Trump will win 4 more years in the White House. The GOP and Mitch McConnell will keep control of the Senate. Trump will nominate 2 or more Supreme Court Justices. With the Supreme Court stacked with conservatives, the court could roll back access to choice for millions of women, roll back LGBTQ+ anti-discrimination laws, and repeal Obamacare.
That’s why we need every single committed Democrat to step up right now. Please, we’re asking you to donate now to beat Trump, take back the Senate, and protect the Democratic House majority. With YOUR support right now, Democrats will win, and Trump will be thrown from the White House in the biggest embarrassment of his lifetime.

But, the McCloskeys do have a big fan \-- America’s racist in chief Donald Trump. He even invited them to speak at the Republican National Convention this week.
This should not surprise anyone paying attention.
Trump has denounced Black Lives Matter as an unpatriotic “Marxist group” intent on destroying the country \-- reviving an old racist trope against the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s that equates the push for racial equality with communism.

BLM and other activists are not protesting the flag. Rather, they are pushing for a racially inclusive nation. Donald Trump prefers the politics of racial division and white nationalism \-- with devoted followers like the McCloskeys. Where do you stand? Tell us now:

Alex,
Last month, Donald Trump signed a proclamation commemorating National Nurses Day. He and his administration praised the “extraordinary care” given by the nation’s frontline heroes in a time of crisis \-- clearly aware of how vital health care is to the soul of the nation.
Then, immediately afterward, Trump reiterated his desire to strike down the Affordable Care Act.
Kicking 20 million Americans off their health insurance because of political pettiness would be reprehensible in any event. But to know those Americans will be disproportionately low-income and left stranded in the middle of a pandemic is totally unacceptable.
Perhaps Joe Biden said it best, “Trump has decided he’d rather destroy President Obama’s legacy than protect the health care of millions upon millions of Americans. He’d rather look after the profits of the insurance industry than make sure people can access healthcare in their hour of need. It’s despicable.”
We agree \-- and hope you do, too. The good news? The president and his allies are outnumbered. But that won’t matter if we don’t make our voices heard.
If you agree that we need to protect the health of millions of Americans by safeguarding the ACA, if you believe that no one should be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition, and if you believe that Donald Trump shouldn’t take his political grudge out on the most vulnerable of our friends and neighbors, especially now, add your name to ours and demand Congress take action to defend the ACA!

Alex,
A CBS News poll finds that 55% of Democratic voters want Biden to make a “bold” choice when selecting a vice president.
Biden has no shortage of bold options: There’s Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia lawmaker who’s made it her goal to fight GOP voter suppression. Amy Klobuchar, the Midwestern underdog who has a heavy swing state appeal. Democratic favorite and progressive icon Elizabeth Warren, and \-- what might be the boldest choice of all \-- even former first lady Michelle Obama.
Biden’s panel has begun screening these choices and many others. The selection process is heating up. Knowing whoever is VP will be a strong candidate for president in 2024 \-- who would you like to see chosen?
Who would you like as VP?
Stacey Abrams
Amy Klobuchar
Elizabeth Warren
Michelle Obama
Kamala Harris

Dr. Fauci says the reason for the increase is Americans’ disregard for safety guidelines, which he reiterated are vital for a proper national recovery.
It’s possible Americans would follow the rules more closely if they got to hear more from Dr. Fauci \-- instead of having to take Trump’s word on the progress of the country’s re-opening.

Voter Turnout Initiative,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,WaPo: Massive participation is how we save our democracy,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Donald Trump is putting together what he calls an “Army for Trump” \-- a poll-watching brigade of supporters he has called on to protect the election from the “radical left.”
Trump has worked to undermine confidence in the election for months, baselessly claiming that Democrats will use mail-in voting to steal the election. During the first presidential debate, he even suggested election officials couldn’t be trusted and urged his supporters to “go into the polls and watch very carefully,” laying the perfect groundwork to steal this election.
Trump won’t be able to do that if we show out in overwhelming numbers. As the Washington Post has reported: “high turnout trumps everything. In 2000, the Supreme Court was important because the election came down to 537 votes. But the court didn’t decide the election in 2004, 2008, 2012 or 2016. That’s the difference between 537 votes and 10,000. The voters have the power to put this one out of the legal system’s reach.”
But Trump’s anti-democratic tactics are already working \-- a group of his supporters in Virginia were seen intimidating voters and blocking entrances to polling places during early voting. We’re mobilizing to protect our voting rights and ensure every eligible voter turns in their ballot this November, but right now we don’t have the funds to expand our voter outreach efforts.
You more than anyone knows what’s at stake this election. Donald Trump’s election has brought us to the brink of authoritarianism \-- and the chance to save our democracy won’t come again for another four years. Alex, will you pitch in now to turn out every single eligible Democrat in November and remove a wannabe tyrant from the White House, expand our House majority, and take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell’s grasp?

Alex,
Our most trusted public health advisor, Dr. Anthony Fauci, is now calling for a national mandate enforcing the use of masks, citing that a surge in coronavirus cases proves we need a more coordinated national approach to the pandemic.
Coronavirus cases are spiking across the U.S. as we enter the winter months, with as many as 85,000 new cases reported every day.
But the Trump administration blocked the CDC’s attempts to mandate masks in public areas, and the White House Chief of Staff all but confirmed they’ve given up trying to protect American lives: “We’re not going to control the pandemic.”
Many countries have successfully used national mask mandates to curb coronavirus infections \-- and Joe Biden has continuously pledged his support for the measure, but he hasn’t been clear on whether he’ll enforce it if elected. In the meantime, Americans remain counterintuitively divided on the use of masks. We’re standing by Dr. Fauci’s sound advice and demanding a national approach to the pandemic, but we’re conducting a survey to gauge what supporters like you think about the proposed measure:
Do you support a national mask mandate?

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Stop Trump from stealing the election,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Newsweek just reported something shocking \-- the drastic changes made to USPS could swing the 2020 election in favor of Donald Trump.
“Many of the 671 decommissioned machines that sort through pieces of mail at lightning speed \-- including mail-in ballots \-- have been removed from post offices in swing states. Added to the existing crisis of delayed deliveries plaguing the federal agency, voters could see their ballots disqualified for missing their states' deadlines.
The impact of those delays could help decide the election.”
But we can fight back \-- by electing Democrats this November.
Our mission is to turn out every single registered Democratic voter in the country. If we do this, we can oust Donald Trump from the White House, take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell, and retain and expand control of the House.
If Democrats control Washington, we can expand health care access to every American, bring an end to Trump’s cruel immigration policies that separate families and leave children in cages, end the coronavirus pandemic by applying science and reason to public health policy, address the climate emergency, and protect Social Security and Medicare for future generations.
But these changes can only happen if we win in November. And right now, Republicans are fighting to retain power. They are outraising Democrats and using that money to silence voters this November. They are sabotaging vital public services such as the USPS to hand Trump back the White House.
Election Day is about two months away and we’re running out of time to mobilize Democratic voters before this critical election. We’re working hard to bring change to the White House and Congress, but right now we’re falling VERY SHORT of our fundraising goals.
If we don’t raise $2,250 by midnight tonight, we won’t be able to continue our critical work. If we fail, Donald Trump returns to the White House and Mitch McConnell retains control of the Senate.
But you can stop this from happening. Please, we’re asking you to help us take back the White House and Senate. You can hand Donald Trump the most embarrassing defeat of his life this November.
Democrats, we need you to step up right now. Please, donate now, and let’s take back our democracy from Donald Trump’s GOP.
We cannot thank you enough for all you’re doing every single day to elect Democrats.

Alex,
This week, the White House served as center stage for the RNC \-- in direct violation of federal rules that bar the White House from hosting political events.
But in the minds of the Trump family, rules are meant to be broken.
Sons Eric and Don Jr. have made over $100 million in real estate deals as heads of the Trump Organization while their dad has been in the White House \-- skirting conflict of interest rules designed to keep close family members from profiting off their ties to the White House. The Trump brothers spent almost $250,000 just to take two trips to Dubai in 2017 \-- and all that money came out of taxpayer pockets.
Daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner were brought into the White House despite anti-nepotism laws and raked in up to $135 million in 2019.
And we can’t forget that the president’s re-election strategy has always rested on illegally using his office to secure another term. First Trump was caught and impeached for attempting to coerce information from the Ukrainian government to use against Joe Biden. Now, he is destroying one of our country’s most vital public services, the USPS, in a desperate attempt to disrupt mail-in voting so he can win in November.
The Trump family has benefited greatly from living in the White House \-- but our democracy continues to suffer. We cannot afford another four years of lawlessness and nepotism. Do you agree? Let us know now:
We need to defeat Donald Trump on November 3 to save our democracy.

It is no surprise that the GOP doesn’t want Democrats to expand voting rights: because when voters hit the polls, Republicans lose. Even Trump admitted on Fox & Friends that if voting rights spread, “you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.”

Alex,
According to The Washington Post, “more than 500 children who, having been wrenched from their families by U.S. government officials with no plan or mechanism ever to reunite them, remain separated.”
A new report by the U.S. Justice Department and the ACLU clarifies that, despite a federal judge’s order that the Trump administration reunite families who were separated by Trump’s cruel “zero tolerance” policy, the parents of 545 children still can’t be found.
Starting in 2017, thousands of families were separated on Trump’s command, with Trump’s attorney general Jeff Sessions telling immigration officials that “we need to take away children” \-- all part of the Trump administration’s inhumane strategy to deter immigrants from seeking amnesty in our country.
Now the government can’t reunite these over 500 children with their parents, and the ACLU reports that over 300 separated children have been lost in the foster care system.
Trump has previously defended his policy with support from his followers, callously claiming that “when you allow the parents to stay [[URL REDACTED]] what happens is people are going to pour into our country.” Many of us have grown numb to Trump’s disturbing acts, but as the Supreme Court prepares to hear two cases that will decide the future of Trump’s restrictive amnesty policies after 2020, we need to know where YOU stand on his failed immigration legacy:

After public outcry, Trump mega-donor and Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has temporarily halted drastic changes to USPS that have significantly slowed down mail delivery and threatened to disrupt the 2020 election.
But this crisis is far from over.
President Donald Trump and the GOP still refuse to provide $25 billion in funding to the cash-strapped agency \-- with President Trump admitting he’s withholding the money to stop mail-in voting: “But if they don’t get those items, that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting because they’re not equipped to have it.”
With a record 76 percent of American voters eligible to vote by mail during the 2020 election, USPS desperately needs this funding to handle the influx of ballots this fall.
But Donald Trump knows that to win in November, he needs low voter turnout \-- just like in 2016. And election experts expect record turnout this November thanks to mail-in voting.
So Trump is attacking mail-in voting any way he can \-- Twitter rhetoric, the purging of USPS \-- and thanks to a $20 million GOP war chest\-- lawsuits against Democratic states that have adopted universal vote by mail.
We cannot let Donald Trump silence the American voter. If you care about protecting our democracy from GOP voter suppression, join our fight today.

Dr. Fauci has spent months protecting the public from Trump’s anti-science agenda and has warned that public health should not be politicized \-- especially during a global pandemic.
But Donald Trump is now insisting Dr. Fauci has praised his coronavirus response, hoping to use voters’ trust in our leading public health expert to sway support in his favor with weeks to go until the election.

Alex,
New polling shows Senator Elizabeth Warren is the most popular choice among Democrats for Biden’s vice president, with POLITICO writing: “Warren (plus-48 percentage points) edges out Harris (44 points) and Klobuchar (38 points) in net favorability.”
On MSNBC, Warren said she’d say “yes” if asked. But other candidates are jockeying for the VP slot, and Trump has repeatedly attacked Warren for being “mean” and has refused to stop calling her “Pocahontas” in the media.
Since she’s got so many competitors for the slot and with the record of presidential attacks on her character, we need to know where Democrats stand:
Would you vote for a Biden/Warren ticket?

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Maddow: Authoritarian Trump wants to steal November election,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Rachel Maddow urgently warned Americans that Donald Trump is moving towards authoritarianism and is taking steps toward stealing the 2020 election: “If you have authoritarian control, you turn the power of the state to your own purposes. Rather, it’s making you and your family and your staff and your cronies rich. Or rather, it’s using the power of the government you control to ensure that nobody else will be allowed to replace you at the top.”
That’s why Trump put top GOP fundraiser Louis DeJoy in charge of the USPS on the eve of a general election that will be decided largely through mail-in voting.
The drastic changes DeJoy brought to the USPS, including removing neighborhood mailboxes, removing mail-sorting machines from post offices, and delaying mail service have caused chaos around the country \-- and called into question the agency’s ability to handle mail-in voting this November.
That’s by design. His main benefactor and boss, Donald Trump, is not a big fan of mail-in voting, and so DeJoy is doing everything in his power to disrupt this election \-- even if that means destroying the USPS.
And while DeJoy has said he would delay the rest of these changes until after the election, he’s also refusing to reverse the damage he caused in the first place.
Political operatives like DeJoy have no business running the nation’s most vital public service. 78 percent of Americans want the USPS to be fully funded and prepared for this November’s election \-- but that can’t happen with DeJoy at the helm. Do you agree? Let us know now:
Should Louis DeJoy step down as Postmaster General?
YES NO

Senator Sanders has rallied behind Biden throughout this election cycle, campaigning on his behalf in battleground states, urging progressive voters to support Biden at the polls, and collaborating with the Biden campaign to create “unity task forces” that provide recommendations on our most pressing issues including health care and climate change.
Biden has made labor and the middle class a priority throughout his campaign, and now Senator Sanders is hoping to bring his decades of experience championing laws to raise the minimum wage, protect and expand labor rights, and support workers unions to the Biden administration.
Senator Sanders can help Joe Biden rebuild our economy in a way that benefits working Americans after the coronavirus pandemic, but Biden’s team is already considering other potential moderate or Republican candidates for the position.

Your action today, on National Voter Registration Day, is crucial for our success in November.
National polls show Joe Biden’s lead over Donald Trump is shrinking, with RealClearPolitics reporting a polling average lead of 5.8 points over Trump \-- down from the 7.2 lead he had earlier in the month. And that’s after Trump publicly admitted to blocking funding for the United States Postal Service to stop Americans from voting by mail during the pandemic, a voting method that half of Democrats now hope to use in November.
Today, we’re working to ensure that every American registers to vote \-- and that come November, Democrats turn out in record-breaking numbers across the country to give Trump and his Republican allies an overwhelming defeat. Biden’s narrow lead across swing states shows us this future is possible.
But Trump mega-donor Sheldon Adelson has pledged to invest up to $50 million to help Trump defeat Biden and turn out voters in key states. That’s why, with just six weeks until the election, we can’t afford to fall behind on our fundraising goal \-- but that’s exactly where we are.
Our work has always relied on committed Democrats like you who believe in a better future for our country \-- and that future will either be built or destroyed by this election.
That’s why we’re reaching out today, on a civic holiday meant to celebrate our democracy, to ask you to support us in saving it. If you care about defeating Trump in November, taking back the Senate from Mitch McConnell’s grasp, and protecting our Democratic House Majority, we need you to donate now. With your support, we’ll turn out every single eligible Democrat and send Trump running out of the White House.

Alex,
Trump and the GOP have another trick up their sleeve to steal the election \-- this time it’s an obscure 200-year-old law.
With the Electoral Count Act, Trump’s baseless accusations of Democratic election fraud can trigger a vote from state legislatures to block electoral votes for Joe Biden. There are 29 total Republican-controlled legislatures \-- including Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Those states alone equal 61 total electoral votes that Biden and Trump remain in a neck-in-neck battle for.
We can preemptively block Trump’s imminent ploy by voting in overwhelming numbers this November. If we turn out to defend and expand our House majority, especially in these key states, we would secure the state delegations we need and leave Trump with no choice but to respect the will of the American people.
But the GOP knows this, and for months, they’ve been funneling dark money where it’s needed most. And now The Cook Political Report has categorized 25 House races as “tossups,” and congressional races will only get tighter as Election Day nears.
Alex, the fact is that there is no boundary that Trump or the GOP won’t cross to steal the election from the American people. You, more than anyone, know that our country simply won’t survive another Trump-Pence term. That’s why we’re asking for your help to turn out Democrats in overwhelming numbers and hand Trump an irrefutable defeat.

51% of Americans oppose Trump filling the Supreme Court vacancy before November 3, according to a new Monmouth University survey of voters nationwide.
It’s welcome news following the recent announcement that Trump has nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. If Barrett is appointed before the Court hears arguments on the Affordable Care Act, the conservative majority will more than likely strike it down \-- leaving millions of Americans without health care.
The late Justice Ginsburg repeatedly upheld the ACA, but now Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans are threatening to destroy her legacy by pushing Barrett through, who wants to revoke Roe vs. Wade. We can’t allow Mitch McConnell to use his power to bypass the will of the American people, but that’s exactly what he’s getting away with now.
And while it’s encouraging to learn most voters support delaying the filling of the SCOTUS seat, we can’t get too comfortable \-- the same survey revealed that the majority of voters polled agree that the Senate should still move forward with confirmation hearings. That’s why it’s critical we hear where YOU stand today:

Alex,
Joe Biden has announced that, if elected, he would establish a bipartisan commission to provide recommendations on ways to overhaul the judicial branch.
In 2016, Republicans refused to even consider Barack Obama's SCOTUS nominee. But now, Donald Trump's Republican Senate majority has rammed through Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation before Election Day in order to secure Trumpian control of the Supreme Court beyond 2020 \-- threatening the progress that our country is striving to make after Trump's disastrous presidency.
Some Democrats have been urging Biden to consider expanding the Supreme Court \-- which is permissible under the Constitution \-- as a way to restore balance on our highest court. After denying his support throughout the election cycle, Biden has now promised voters that his bipartisan commission will provide different ways to counteract the GOP's power grabs in our judicial branch.
The majority of Americans opposed the Senate's move to confirm Amy Coney Barrett before inauguration, but remain increasingly divided on what steps Democrats should take to offset the now 6-3 majority in the Supreme Court. Decades of decisions covering everything from affordable health care, to reproductive justice, and even our voting rights are now potentially in the hands of a few Trump loyalists.

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Here's why Trump is holding up relief,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Donald Trump has declared the sweeping relief package that House Democrats have already passed as “dead on arrival.”
While Democrats in Congress are moving quickly to bring additional immediate relief to local governments and direct cash payments to everyday Americans, Trump is blocking those efforts because he’s insisting on another tax cut first.
Trump’s angling for another tax break for the well-off instead of helping the Americans who are suffering shows exactly what kind of leader he is.
But a CNBC/Change Research poll shows that swing state voters prefer Trump to Biden on the economy \-- by 11 points. The only way to change that narrative and give Americans the relief they need will be to send an even stronger message that we won’t tolerate Trump’s inaction in a crisis \-- so please, tell us now:
Do you approve of Donald Trump?
YES NO

Alex,
Donald Trump knowingly downplayed the dangers of the coronavirus for months \-- and he’s not finished.
In an interview with Bob Woodward earlier this year, he admitted the virus was “deadly stuff” and “it’s also more deadly than even your strenuous flus” \-- he then said he “wanted to always play it down” despite knowing the dangerous effects it could have on the country.
But during this week’s ABC town hall, when he was asked if he could have done more to stop the pandemic, Trump replied: “I don’t think so.”
Kamala Harris has condemned Trump’s lies and his continued disregard for American lives, saying “It's on tape. Trump knowingly downplayed the dangers of the virus, and nearly 200,000 Americans have died. We must vote him out.”
Harris is ready to protect Americans from Donald Trump’s blatant disregard for science. Are you ready to fight alongside her as Democrats attempt to take back the White House and Senate? We’re preparing our efforts to get Democrats to the polls this fall, but we need to hear from you. Let us know now if you support our vice presidential candidate:

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Rolling Stone reveals diabolical GOP plan to suppress votes on Election Day,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
It’s less than 100 days until Election Day \-- and Joe Biden has a double digit lead in the polls.
But Hillary Clinton also had a big lead in 2016 \-- and lost on Election Day.
Winning in November will come down to who votes. But in 2016, nearly 100 million Americans stayed home. Trump won the White House while Mitch McConnell maintained control of the Senate.
Now, a shocking new Rolling Stone exposé details the GOP’s plans to suppress the vote in 2020: “Blocking ballots, intimidating voters, spreading misinformation – undermining democracy is at the heart of Trump’s 2020 campaign.”
Our mission is to turn out every single eligible Democratic voter in the country. And if we do, Trump will be out of the White House, Mitch McConnell will lose control of the Senate, and Democrats will expand our House majority.
If Democrats control Washington, we’ll expand health care access to every single American in this country. Democrats will take bold action on climate change by expanding green jobs and putting Americans back to work in a new green economy. Democrats will put a stop to the horrendous practice of putting immigrant children in cages and reopen our country with a fair immigration policy. And we’ll expand and protect access to Medicare and Social Security for our seniors and future generations.
But the GOP has raised millions in dark money to target Democratic voters \-- as Donald Trump begins to realize that the only way he can win in November is through voter suppression.
We’re doing everything we can to fight back. And unlike the GOP, we’re a grassroots effort relying on donors like you. But right now, we’re falling VERY SHORT of our fundraising goals.
If we don’t raise another $3,200 by midnight tonight, we’ll have to scale back our work turning out voters who are committed to beat Trump. We’ll have to cut support to Senate and House races around the country. If we fail, Trump will win 4 more years in the White House. The GOP and Mitch McConnell will keep control of the Senate. Trump will nominate 2 or more Supreme Court Justices. With the Supreme Court stacked with conservatives, the court could roll back access to choice for millions of women, roll back LGBTQ+ anti-discrimination laws, and repeal Obamacare.
That’s why we need every single committed Democrat to step up right now. Please, we’re asking you to donate now to beat Trump, take back the Senate, and protect the Democratic House majority. With YOUR support right now, Democrats will win, and Trump will be thrown from the White House in the biggest embarrassment of his lifetime.
We cannot thank you enough for all you’re doing every single day to elect Democrats.

Washington Post editorial board: “Another term could allow Mr. Trump to complete the demoralization, politicization and destruction of a workforce that was once the envy of the world: the American civil service, health service, Foreign Service and uniformed military. In everything from consumer safety to air quality to life expectancy, the results would be catastrophic. But there would be nobody left to measure them.”
The Washington Post said it best, Trump has systematically depleted our government agencies of the experts and advisers who keep our country running \-- and his reelection would cause irreparable damage to our democracy.
It would give Trump another four years to isolate the United States on the world stage, replace top experts with political loyalists, and finalize his increasingly authoritarian moves to illegally expand executive power.
Our country won’t survive another Trump-Pence term. That’s why we’re planning a new engagement strategy to get Democrats to the polls in overwhelming numbers and support Joe Biden and Kamala Harris this November.
Millions of Democratic voters stayed home in 2016 and handed Donald Trump four years in the White House \-- that’s why we need to know where YOU stand now as November approaches:

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris can return true leadership to the White House \-- but only if Democrats show up and vote in November.
Unfortunately, Donald Trump is already making that more difficult. He’s slowed down the U.S. Postal Service to disrupt mail-in voting and Democratic turnout this November.
If re-elected, Trump will destroy Obamacare, end DACA, and add even more hard-right justices to the Supreme Court.
And while Trump is down big in polls, Nate Silver still gives him a 28 percent chance to win \-- roughly the same chance he was given to win the 2016 election.
Michelle Obama is correct: Donald Trump is not fit to be president. But unless Democrats go vote in November \-- he will be around for four more years.

Dr. Anthony Fauci is this nation’s top infectious disease expert. He’s dutifully worked to keep Americans safe under six different presidential administrations and has led the American response against HIV/AIDS, Zika, and Ebola.
Yet \-- in the midst of the biggest public health crisis of our lives \-- Dr. Fauci’s credibility is under attack from the very man he’s tasked to help, President Donald Trump.
Trump and members of his administration have placed the blame for the escalating COVID crisis on Fauci \-- even though Trump has continually ignored the advice of Fauci and other public health officials. Trump’s Senior Trade Advisor Peter Navarro even bashed Fauci in a USA Today op-ed \-- which the newspaper pointed out was filled with lies about Fauci’s performance.
This is wrong. Fauci, unlike the president, works to keep Americans safe. His voice should be amplified \-- not silenced by a corrupt administration hellbent on ignoring the virus away.

Kamala Harris provided a glimpse of a presidential administration that will lead with compassion, logic, and collective strength to move our country forward. But it’s up to us to fulfill that vision.

These trends are sounding the alarm \-- we need to turn out in overwhelming numbers to defeat Trump in November. During just four years in power, Trump has weaponized our immigration system to separate families and encourage xenophobia, created a war on science that has left over 200,000 Americans dead during a pandemic that could have been controlled, and threatened a constitutional crisis by publicly stating that he will suppress the vote to stay in power.
All because 100 million voters decided to stay home 2016 and handed Trump the White House.
We cannot afford to repeat that same mistake in 2020. The fate of our democracy now rests with us. Have you made a plan to vote during this critical election \-- or will you stay home and risk another four years of Donald Trump?

Senator Warren recognizes that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is set to steal another Supreme Court seat, just like he did in 2016. And Trump has chosen his perfect nominee to shape the court forever: Judge Amy Coney Barrett, an extremist who will overturn Roe v. Wade, endorse Trump’s attack on immigrants, strip away voting rights, and let the judiciary become a puppet for corporate interests.
Senator Warren has been a trailblazer from the beginning, doing everything she can to protect our democracy from GOP tyranny this election cycle. She’s advocated for a national vote-by-mail initiative and has pressured Congress to investigate Trump’s multi-millionaire donor, Louis DeJoy, and his destruction of the USPS.
By refusing to meet with Judge Barrett, Senator Warren is standing up to Republican destruction of our third branch of government. But Mitch McConnell is determined to push a vote in the Senate for Trump’s nominee by the end of October.

The stakes of this election are very clear to Bernie Sanders: We must defeat Donald Trump in November.
And right now, things look good.
With less than 75 days until Election Day, Joe Biden continues to dominate Donald Trump in general election polls. However, FiveThirtyEight’s Nate SIlver has a warning to those counting the president out already: Trump still has a strong chance to win re-election.
In fact, Silver projects that Trump currently has a 28 percent chance to win in November \-- roughly the same chance he gave Trump in 2016.
Trump will win again if voter turnout is low. That’s why he’s interfering with the USPS to disrupt mail-in voting and suing states that are adopting universal vote-by-mail.
Trump wants to silence American voters. We must fight back. To save our democracy, every Democrat must show up to vote in November. If we do, we can oust Trump from the White House, take back the Senate, and build on our House majority.
We can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump. That’s why we need you to commit to voting TODAY. Will you commit to voting for the Biden-Harris ticket this November?

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Jaime Harrison tightens race with Trump ally Graham,"When Democrats Turn Out
Hi Alex,
It looks like Donald Trump’s favorite senator, Lindsey Graham, is in for a tight race this November.
A recent poll by Morning Consult showed the incumbent senator from South Carolina only one point ahead of Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison.
Graham would usually be considered a heavy favorite in this deeply red state \-- but this election cycle is different.
Graham is facing off against Harrison, the first Black chairman of South Carolina’s Democratic Party. Harrison is looking to capitalize on strong support from Black South Carolinians and voters increasingly horrified by Lindsey Graham’s relationship with Donald Trump.
During his own 2016 presidential run, Graham called Trump a “race-baiting, xenophobic bigot."" But since then, Graham has somehow become Trump’s staunchest supporter on Capitol Hill \-- a reliable cheerleader who explains away every Trump misstep and lie.
South Carolinians have noticed this shift, and they aren’t too happy. Graham’s popularity is now under 50 percent in the state \--  giving Harrison an opening in November.
Barack Obama, Stacey Abrams, Senator Kamala Harris, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, and other top Democrats are backing Harrison \-- where do you stand? Let us know now:
Do you support Jaime Harrison?
YES NO
We cannot win without your input now.

Alex,
A recent Pew Research Center poll found that 51% of Americans believe Donald Trump will defeat Joe Biden in November.
Ever since Donald Trump and Mike Pence swept the electoral college and overcame Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine’s sizable polling leads in 2016, we have seen federal law enforcement terrorize American cities, the USPS dismantled for political purposes, and over 190,000 Americans die from a pandemic that the Trump administration failed to take seriously.
All because 100 million voters stayed home on Election Day in 2016.
The choice is yours: stay home and risk another 4 years of Donald Trump and Mike Pence, or go out to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, bringing much needed change to the White House. We’re trying to craft our strategy to reach Democratic voters before November, but we don’t have enough data yet. That’s why we need you to update your November election plans NOW:
This November, I plan to vote for:

The Washington Post has reported that there were more positive reported cases of the coronavirus within the White House last week than there were in over a dozen entire countries.
According to ABC News, over 34 people from the Trump administration have tested positive for COVID-19 after a maskless Rose Garden event which has now potentially exposed hundreds. Despite setting off what POLITICO is calling a “multistate COVID tracing crisis,” the Trump administration has refused to implement mandatory masks measures or abide by basic public health protections.
Over 215,000 Americans have now lost their lives during the pandemic \-- meanwhile, Trump has continued his anti-science vendetta, undermining public health experts, spreading lies about coronavirus side effects, and bypassing FDA guidelines to approve a vaccine before the election.
But in Trump’s words, “Nobody that’s a leader would not do what I did.”
During last week’s debate, Mike Pence stated, “President Trump has made it clear that we’re going to continue to listen to the science.” Pence continually praised his administration’s coronavirus response. According to Pence, Trump has served as an exceptional leader throughout this pandemic, but today we’re conducting our own poll to gauge if voters agree with him. Please, tell us now:

We are now exactly one week away from the highest stakes election of our lifetime \-- and things are looking good for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
A recent NPR poll shows that Biden now holds a comfortable eleven point national lead over Donald Trump, and he is holding a slight edge in key states like Michigan and Wisconsin.
But Republican political consultant Dee Stewart has reminded us not to get too comfortable, claiming that “the tremendous voter registration gain by the Republicans is the secret weapon that will make the difference for the Republicans in 2020.” That’s because, according to The New York Times, Republicans have seen a spike in voter registration in Florida, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania \-- and “heavy turnout by those new party members might just be enough to propel Mr. Trump to a second term.”
Six battleground states don’t report voter registration by party, and we can’t afford a surprise Trump victory on Election Day. We know that we will need an overwhelming voter turnout to block Trump’s attempts to steal this election. With the future of our country at stake, we need to ensure Biden’s support holds through November 3. That’s why we need to know:

Alex,
Donald Trump is hellbent on fighting a war against immigration \-- and is even willing to defy the Supreme Court in pursuit of his xenophobic agenda.
In June, the Supreme Court halted President Trump’s attempt to end the DACA program. The Trump administration was later ordered by a federal judge to start accepting DACA applications and give Dreamers the standard two year deportation protection to stay in the country.
But Trump is now openly abandoning that order. His administration announced that they will no longer accept applications and only give deportation protection to applicants for one year.
Immigration experts fear Trump is trying to stall for time as he comes up with a legal plan to end DACA if he is re-elected.
In a forceful editorial, the Washington Post pushed back against Trump’s anti-immigrant views \-- and outlined the damage the end of DACA would cause to immigrant communities, “In planning DACA’s demise, the president is striking another blow against America’s growing diversity, which he clearly abhors. In the process, he also threatens the futures of individuals and communities whose fortunes are bound up in America’s own.”
We cannot stand Donald Trump’s continued assault on immigration. For the sake of Dreamers, we need to come out in November and vote to oust Donald Trump.
Join us and stand up for Dreamers right now:

The Washington Post has reported that, as of Wednesday, more than 42 million Americans have already cast their ballots for the 2020 election \-- and just over half of those votes were cast in battleground states.
Recent polling data has confirmed that Democrats are turning out to vote in record-breaking numbers to hold Donald Trump accountable this year \-- and an analysis by TargetSmart, a digital data firm, predicts that 53% of all early votes have been cast by Democrats.
But political strategists have warned against preemptively counting on a Biden-Harris victory, telling POLITICO that there are “clear warning signs” that Trump could still overcome his polling deficit and citing uncertainty over rejected mail-in-ballot rates and “increasing registration of white, non-college educated voters \-- Trump’s base demographic \-- in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.”
In 2016, millions of Americans thought their vote wouldn’t make a difference and failed to cast their ballots because the polls indicated Hillary Clinton as a clear winner \-- meanwhile, Trump won a number of battleground states by razor-thin margins to gain four years in power. We can’t afford to make the same mistake again. With less than two weeks to go, we are counting on a massive democratic turnout to win this election. That’s why we need to know:

Electoral Protection Committee,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,The trusty law Trump could use to steal the election,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
The Atlantic has sounded the alarm on an obscure law Donald Trump could use to steal the election.
Trump has already openly admitted he plans to suppress the vote and use his far-right Supreme Court majority to keep his grasp on power. But he hasn’t been as eager to disclose that, under the Electoral Count Act, Trump can use Republican-held state legislatures to block electoral votes for Joe Biden, triggering a stalemate.
In that case, the election would be decided by a vote of state delegations in the newly elected House of Representatives in 2021 \-- and since we currently hold a Democratic majority in the House but not a majority of state delegations, Republicans in Congress could hand Trump the White House, even if he loses the election.
We can preemptively block Trump’s imminent ploy by voting in overwhelming numbers this November. If we turn out to defend and expand our House majority, especially in key states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Florida, we would secure the state delegations we need to leave Trump with no choice but to respect the will of the American people. But The Cook Political Report has categorized over 25 House races as a “toss up,” and congressional races will only get tighter as Election Day nears. Today, we need your commitment to support Democrats and protect our electoral integrity:

Alex,
The Supreme Court has ruled that the census count can be cut short, clearing the way for the Trump administration to disenfranchise thousands of Americans for the next decade.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the sole public dissenter, writing: “The harms caused by rushing this year’s census count are irreparable. And respondents will suffer their lasting impact for at least the next 10 years.”
The GOP and Trump administration are arguing that with 99% of U.S. residents counted, those who remain are negligible. But Justice Sotomayor is setting the record straight and exposing their nefarious rationale: “Even a fraction of a percent of the Nation’s 140 million households amounts to thousands of people left uncounted. And significantly, the percentage of nonresponses is likely much higher among marginalized populations and in hard-to-count areas, such as rural and tribal lands.”
Alex \-- this is just another example of Republicans hurting our country’s most vulnerable populations in the name of political gain. Our leaders in the courts are exposing this plot, and the least we can do is add our voices to the fray. Please let us know whether you stand with Sotomayor by telling us:
Should the census count be extended?

Alex,
NBC: “The number of people from President Donald Trump’s orbit who have tested positive for the coronavirus is growing, with at least eight confirmed cases tied to an event in the Rose Garden last weekend.”
Health officials are now desperately racing to contact the hundreds of people Trump potentially exposed to the coronavirus during a series of maskless events prior to his diagnosis. While Trump receives the free high quality health care he has categorically denied others, POLITICO reports his careless actions in the past weeks have “the potential to exacerbate outbreaks” in states that have started to see a resurgence of the virus \-- all while Trump’s administration fights to strip millions of Americans of their health care.
We’re fighting every day to bring a new administration to the White House that will work to improve the lives of everyday Americans instead of jeopardizing them. Together, we can elect Democrats who will lead with compassion, restore our values, and expand health care when Americans need it most.
But voters around the country have already started casting their ballots, and FiveThirtyEight projects Trump’s chances of winning are similar to those he had in 2016 when millions of voters stayed home to give Trump four years in office. Now more than ever, we need to make sure that Democrats turn out in overwhelming numbers and that all votes are counted, but right now we’re falling behind on the fundraising goals we have to meet to get voters to the polls.
Alex, we’re counting on you and every single committed Democrat to help us restore our democracy and bring sound leadership back to Washington in November. Donald Trump’s reelection would destroy our access to health care, voting rights, the electoral process, and the future of a just Supreme Court. The chance to stand against these injustices won’t come again for another four years -- we must act now. That’s why we’re asking today: will you pitch in now to turn out every single eligible Democrat in November and usher in a blue wave in Washington?

Alex,
Joe Biden is estimated to have raised over $300 million toward his re-election campaign in the past month, much of it through grassroots fundraising \-- but as impressive as that is, Biden’s campaign can’t compete when Trump is willing to use the federal treasury funds to support his campaign.
NBC put it best: “Trump has demonstrated he is willing and able to use tax dollars to fund his campaign in ways that make monthly fundraising reports look like pocket change.”
This year, the federal government is on pace to allocate $6.6 trillion, and Trump has found countless ways to turn that into political benefits for himself \-- putting his name on $290 billion in stimulus checks, running a coronavirus response campaign “to defeat hope and despair,” and promising to give more federal funds to voters \-- especially in critical swing states.
Trump is using the federal government to win this election in unprecedented ways, and if he’s re-elected, he’ll continue to illegally expand executive power.
Our country simply won’t survive another Trump-Pence term. That’s why we’re planning a new engagement strategy to get Democrats to the polls in overwhelming numbers and support Joe Biden and Kamala Harris this November.
But millions of Democratic voters stayed home in 2016 and handed Donald Trump four years in the White House \-- that’s why we need to know where YOU stand now as November approaches:

The Trump campaign claimed it would “do a rally instead,” despite Trump’s recent coronavirus diagnosis and the fact that several members of his staff have already tested positive for the virus.
Reuters reported that Washington D.C. saw its highest surge of new coronavirus cases since June after Trump’s diagnosis, and elected officials said they “feared the outbreak connected to the Trump administration was out of control.” But despite these growing health concerns, Trump has announced he’s planning a return to his cross-country maskless rallies as early as this week \-- and his campaign brazenly stated that “no extra health precautions are set to be implemented at future events.”

Voter Turnout Initiative,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,WaPo: Massive voter participation is how we save our democracy,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Donald Trump is putting together what he calls an “Army for Trump” \-- a poll-watching brigade of supporters he has called on to protect the election from the “radical left.”
Trump has worked to undermine confidence in the election for months, baselessly claiming that Democrats will use mail-in voting to steal the election. During the first presidential debate, he even suggested election officials couldn’t be trusted and urged his supporters to “go into the polls and watch very carefully,” laying the perfect groundwork to steal this election.
Trump won’t be able to do that if we show out in overwhelming numbers. As The Washington Post has reported: “high turnout trumps everything. In 2000, the Supreme Court was important because the election came down to 537 votes. But the court didn’t decide the election in 2004, 2008, 2012 or 2016. That’s the difference between 537 votes and 10,000. The voters have the power to put this one out of the legal system’s reach.”
But Trump’s anti-democratic tactics are already working \-- a group of his supporters in Virginia were seen intimidating voters and blocking entrances to polling places during early voting. We’re mobilizing to protect our voting rights and ensure every eligible voter turns in their ballot this November, but right now we don’t have the funds to expand our voter outreach efforts.
You more than anyone know what’s at stake this election. Donald Trump’s election has brought us to the brink of authoritarianism -- and the chance to save our democracy won’t come again for another four years. Alex, will you pitch in now to turn out every single eligible Democrat in November and remove a wannabe tyrant from the White House, expand our House majority, and take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell’s grasp?

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,"Trump lashes out against Black Lives Matter, athlete protests","When Democrats Turn Out
Hi Alex,
The continued protests for racial justice continue to annoy America’s Racist-in-Chief, Donald Trump.
During a recent Fox News interview, Trump denounced Black Lives Matter as an unpatriotic “Marxist group” intent on destroying the country.
Sadly, Trump is reviving an old racist trope \-- in the 1950s and 60s, equating the push for racial justice with a covert Communist plot was a common tactic for segregationists to denounce the Civil Rights Movement.
Trump also lashed out at the NBA and MLB players who have collectively decided to kneel during the National Anthem in support of the Black Lives Matter movement: “We have to stand up for our flag, we have to stand up for our country, we have to stand up for our anthem and a lot of people agree with me.”
BLM and other activists are not protesting the flag. Rather, they are pushing for a racially inclusive nation. Donald Trump prefers the politics of racial division and white nationalism. Where do you stand? Tell us now:
Do you support Black Lives Matter?
YES NO
We cannot win without your input now.

Alex,
Do you remember when, in the lead-up to the 2016 election, Donald Trump took a look at his poor poll numbers and started saying the election would be “rigged?”
He’s at it again. Except this time, as the leader of the free world.
A June 22 tweet from @realDonaldTrump reads ""RIGGED 2020 ELECTION: MILLIONS OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS WILL BE PRINTED BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND OTHERS. IT WILL BE THE SCANDAL OF OUR TIMES!""
Source: Twitter
It’s not clear which “foreign countries” the president means \-- as he’s been the only candidate to solicit re-election help from foreign powers. But Trump’s game is clear: cast doubt on the election so that, when he loses, he can refuse to leave the White House.
Joe Biden has promised that, if Trump tries to defy the election outcome, he’ll get a military escort out of the Oval Office. But Trump has said that his supporters may “demand” he stay in office. Will you demand he leave? Tell us now:
Should we allow Trump to reject the results of the election?

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Trump takes aim at democracy,"When Democrats Turn Out
Considering the risk associated with physically going to the polls, it’s no surprise that 51% of voters say they’re likely to vote by mail in November.
To support Americans’ quest for safe voting, House Democrats have passed a bill that would give states $3.6 billion in election funding \-- enough to guarantee that every single American gets to vote by mail this election.
But Donald Trump has said the bill is “dead on arrival.” That makes sense. Trump has already admitted to the entire country that he hates vote-by-mail because Republicans lose when voters are given every option to vote.
The problem now, according to Wendy Weiser \-- director of the Democracy Program at the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice \-- is that “There is a real significant risk to the integrity of the election if we don’t invest now in our election infrastructure. We’re going to see large-scale disenfranchisement, delays, and meltdowns.”
That’s exactly what Trump is counting on to win. If voters don’t vote, Trump gets another four years. But the founding fathers put a system in place to check presidents who rise above their station and begin to threaten democracy itself, like Trump has done. Tell us if you think Democrats and Republicans in Congress should use their power to override Trump and protect the ballot for their constituents. Let us know:
Should Congress act now to protect the November elections?

Trump Polygraph Committee,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Trump lies (badly) about ACB's threat to Roe v. Wade,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
When Joe Biden brought up Amy Coney Barrett’s inevitable attack on abortion rights on Tuesday night, Donald Trump claimed: “You don’t know her view on Roe v. Wade.”
Except we do know. There’s a reason why so many pro-life Republicans and anti-abortion groups have supported Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Barrett’s track record strongly suggests that she’ll strike down Roe v. Wade the first chance she gets \-- which could be quite soon, contrary to Trump’s debate-stage lies that “it’s not on the ballot” and “there’s nothing happening there.”
Trump and the other pro-life GOPers don’t have the majority of Americans on their side. A new NBC News poll shows that sixty-six percent of adults don’t support Roe v. Wade being overturned by the Supreme Court. And we know this issue matters to Democrats since the data also shows that 86% of adult Dems oppose the idea. We have the ability to win if Democrats show up and vote like their bodily autonomy and lives depend on it \-- which they should, because they do.
But the GOP knows their foundation is cracking, so they’re working day and night to push Barrett through before the election to keep Trump in power. When Democrats Turn Out is determined to mobilize voters nationwide so that their efforts fail miserably. But to do that, we need more money. If we don’t reach our fundraising goal of $2,349 by midnight tonight, we’re not going to be able to launch the next phase of our voter engagement campaign.
We know that the reproductive rights of Americans matter to you. That’s why we’re asking you to donate $25, right now, to support this fight. With your help, we’re going to put someone in the White House who actually supports our medical rights and bodily autonomy -- alongside a team of progressive allies in Congress.
Thank you for stepping up at this critical moment for our country.

Electoral Action,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Only voters can hold Trump accountable,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Joe Biden will use the ABC Town Hall taking place tonight, in lieu of the cancelled presidential debate, to make some of his last impressions on undecided voters ahead of the election.
Biden currently holds a comfortable double-point lead over Donald Trump, and the most recent Monmouth University poll found that Biden is even maintaining an edge in key states like North Carolina that Trump won in 2016.
The momentum is growing for the Biden-Harris ticket, and millions of Americans have already started casting their ballots. But we know that won’t stop Donald Trump from using any ploy he can to steal this election \-- he’s told us as much himself.
Trump can employ a number of loopholes to win, especially if he loses by a narrow margin. From packing the Supreme Court with loyalist judges who can hand him a contested election, to counting on a Republican delegation majority in the House to block electoral votes for Biden, to now calling on supporters to intimidate voters at the polls \-- Trump is laying the groundwork to stay in power.
But here’s what Trump doesn’t want you to know: None of these ploys will work if voters turn out in overwhelming numbers to give him an uncontestable defeat. The numbers don’t lie, and today we need your commitment to turn out and defend our electoral process:
Will you vote for Joe Biden in November?

The former first lady has continued working for the American people and taken a vocal role in the fight against systemic racism in the White House, GOP voter suppression, and Trump’s failure to protect the American people during a public health crisis.
Through her Civic Cities initiative, Michelle Obama is teaming up with dozens of mayors across the country \-- with the goal of safely increasing voter participation for as many Americans as possible in advance of an historic election.
Obama has said she is fighting back against the “lack of empathy, the division stoked in times of crisis, and the age-old and systemic racism that’s been so prominent this summer” in Trump’s America. But 45% of Republicans disagree with Michelle, saying racism isn’t a very big problem \-- do you stand with our former first lady? Tell us now:

Alex,
According to Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who runs the US Elections Project, the United States is on track to have the highest voter turnout percentage since 1908.
The US is already breaking early voting records and is on track to reach historic voter turnout levels, but we can’t celebrate just yet. Democrats may make up a large proportion of early voters, but the Trump campaign has warned that “Republicans will show up in person on Election Day and reelect President Trump.”
This year, Democrats have the power to kick Trump out of office once and for all \-- we saw this power in the 2018 midterms when we took back the House. But CNBC reports that Republicans are already making up lost ground in the early voting game: Democrats are responsible for 43.3% of ballots cast in person so far, and Republicans are close behind at 35.5%.
When Democrats Turn Out is working relentlessly to activate voters across the country so that gap widens and Joe Biden wins in a landslide \-- but we’re running low on funds. If we don’t raise another $3,953 by midnight, we’ll have to halt our mobilization efforts, and eligible voters in battleground states might not have their voices heard.
The election is TOMORROW – and we have to get as many Democrats to the polls as we can. You know how important it is that Trump doesn’t get the second term he’s so desperate for.

This is terrifying. Donald Trump is openly inciting violence against those he sees as his enemies.
Late last week, Trump posted a video from a supporter on Twitter who declares, “The only good Democrat is a dead Democrat.”
The next day, Trump issued a racially-charged threat against protestors in Minneapolis \-- threatening to deploy the National Guard and telling Americans, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.”
There’s no precedent for the President of the United States promoting violence against political opponents and American citizens, but Trump has been doing this since before he was even elected \-- leading rally crowds in chants of “lock her up” and telling his supporters to “knock the crap out of” protestors who disrupt them.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris can return true leadership to the White House \-- but only if Democrats show up and vote in November.
Unfortunately, Donald Trump is already making that more difficult. He’s slowed down the U.S. Postal Service to disrupt mail-in voting and Democratic turnout this November.

The good news continues for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Last month, the Democratic ticket had the biggest polling lead heading into the party convention since 1996 with a comfortable seven-point lead on Donald Trump and Mike Pence, according to Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight.

Americans are showing out in record numbers to demand change, and we’re closer than we’ve ever been to seeing a blue wave in Washington.
But The New York Times also offered some words of caution: Official mail-in counts for several states will not be available by election night. In fact, two battleground states, Michigan and Pennsylvania, have stated that official counts could take several days.
After waging a war against the United States Postal Service to make it harder for Americans to cast their ballots by mail, Trump is now focusing his efforts on suing states to prevent mail-in ballots from being counted at all \-- and he’s already had some success.
Americans are doing their part to defend our democracy, but now we need to keep the pressure on our elected officials to protect our electoral integrity against the GOP’s brazen voter suppression tactics. There is too much at stake to leave our voices unheard, which is why we need you to stand with us now:
Do you demand that every vote is counted?
YES NO

Electoral Protection Committee,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,The trusty law Trump could use to steal this election,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
The Atlantic has sounded the alarm on an obscure law Donald Trump could use to steal the election.
Trump has already openly admitted he plans to suppress the vote and use his far-right Supreme Court majority to keep his grasp on power. But he hasn’t been as eager to disclose that, under the Electoral Count Act, Trump can use Republican-held state legislatures to block electoral votes for Joe Biden, triggering a stalemate.
In that case, the election would be decided by a vote of state delegations in the newly elected House of Representatives in 2021 \-- and since we currently hold a Democratic majority in the House but not a majority of state delegations, Republicans in Congress could hand Trump the White House, even if he loses the election.
We can preemptively block Trump’s imminent ploy by voting in overwhelming numbers this November. If we turn out to defend and expand our House majority, especially in key states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Florida, we would secure the state delegations we need to leave Trump with no choice but to respect the will of the American people. But The Cook Political Report has categorized over 25 House races as “tossups,” and congressional races will only get tighter as Election Day nears. Today, we need your commitment to support Democrats and protect our electoral integrity:
Will you vote for Democrats in November?
YES NO

Alex,
538’s Nate Silver thinks that, even with decreasing home state benefits from VP choices, Biden’s pick could still cause enough of a spike to flip an essential swing state.
In a close battleground state like Michigan \-- where Trump won by only 0.3% in 2016 \-- Silver predicts a Gretchen Whitmer pick could give Biden a 1-2 point bump and the state.
It’s never been more clear that the right running mate could make all the difference. Biden has committed to picking a woman, but that’s the only requirement he’s given \-- otherwise, the race is wide open. That’s why we’re reaching out to engaged Democrats to get their take \-- tell us now:
Who would you like as VP?

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Attorneys general file legal complaint to protect DACA from Trump,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Attorneys general from 16 states and the District of Columbia filed a legal complaint last Friday challenging the Trump administration’s continual defiance of the Supreme Court’s DACA program ruling.
In June, the Supreme Court halted President Trump’s attempt to end the DACA program \-- and the Trump administration was later ordered by a federal judge to start accepting DACA applications and give Dreamers the standard two-year deportation protection to stay in the country.
But Trump openly disobeyed that order. Instead, he improperly designated a new Department of Homeland Security Secretary who announced DHS would only give deportation protections to Dreamers for one year instead of two and would not accept new applicants.
Trump is so determined to target immigrants who came to this country as children that he is willing to disregard the Supreme Court.
Immigration experts fear Trump is trying to stall for time as he comes up with a legal plan to end DACA after his potential re-election.
We cannot allow this. For the sake of Dreamers, we need to come out in November and vote to oust Donald Trump.
Join us and stand up for Dreamers by telling us now:
Do you support DACA?

As a lawyer and Supreme Court justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg has fought to protect progressive values her entire career.
RBG continues to be the top liberal voice on the Court -- most recently blocking the Trump administration’s attempt to end DACA, ending restrictions on abortion access, and banning workplace discrimination against LGBTQ+ workers.
Despite a recurring battle with cancer and increased hostility from President Trump and the GOP, RBG continues her work to make the country a fairer, more just place for ALL Americans.
However, RBG’s progressive legacy is in danger -- as President Trump and Mitch McConnell will add more conservative judges to the Court if the GOP wins the White House and the Senate this November.

America’s frontline workers are using today to demand they receive the health benefits and personal protection equipment the federal government and their private employers have failed to provide.
The employees of Amazon, Whole Foods, Instacart, Target, Shipt, FedEx, and Walmart are all fighting together for paid sick leave, hazard pay, and safe working conditions \-- demands that all workers deserve to have met, but especially these frontline employees.
While small businesses have been hit hard by the pandemic, big businesses have profited \-- with Amazon seeing a 26% increase in first quarter revenue due to stay-at-home orders. But that money isn’t reaching their most vulnerable employees \-- and Democratic senators sent a letter to Bezos last month expressing concerns about working conditions at Amazon and Amazon’s firing of a worker who’d advocated for better health and safety protections.
Workers across the country need our support now. They are asking for basic human dignity \-- and we’re standing with them.

RBG is truly an American hero.
As a pioneering legal scholar and lawyer, RBG fought for women’s rights in front of the Supreme Court.
She later joined the Court as the second female justice in history \-- and became the bench’s fiercest advocate for abortion rights, birth control access, and equal pay for women.
RBG has fought for women her whole career. But her legacy is in danger if Donald Trump and Mitch McConnel regain control of the White House and Senate this November \-- as they will add more conservative judges to the Supreme Court, whose majority is already hellbent on rolling back the women’s rights RBG fought so hard for.
Joe Biden currently has a double-digit lead in the polls \-- but so did Hillary Clinton in 2016.
The Washington Post reports Biden has an enthusiasm problem, Trump has $53 million more in cash on hand than Biden, and close to 100 million voters stayed home on Election Day in 2016.
With the future of the Supreme Court on the line, it's essential we know your feelings:

Alex,
Donald Trump’s former campaign staff went to the White House to deliver the latest polling data: it shows he’s losing ground.
The president is now behind Joe Biden in Florida and Arizona, and Trump won Arizona by over 3 points in 2016. Even more alarming for the GOP, Biden has also caught up to Trump in Georgia \-- which means a state no Democratic presidential contender has won in almost 30 years is now in play.
In response, the president called top operatives from Florida and Arizona to an immediate meeting at the White House \-- it looks like Trump and his team have started to panic.
They have good reason to. But 50% of Americans still see Trump as a “strong leader,” and a New York Times report says state polls could be off again this year like they were in 2016. Ultimately, whether or not Trump should be worried comes down to you \-- tell us:

The D.C. office also requested a lenient sentence for Roger Stone, the self-proclaimed “dirty trickster” and Trump advisor who was convicted of lying to Congress, obstruction of justice, and witness tampering.
Now, Trump has picked a new attorney to serve permanently as his personal “fixer” in the D.C. DOJ office.

However, FiveThirtyEight’s Geoffrey Skelley and Nathaniel Rakich were quick to point out that the race is entering “a traditionally volatile period for presidential campaigns” and that the Biden-Harris lead would undoubtedly shrink.
Donald Trump and Mike Pence can still win \-- just as they were able to overcome Hillary Clinton's and Tim Kaine’s sizable polling leads in 2016.

This week, the White House served as center stage for the RNC \-- in direct violation of federal rules that bar the White House from hosting political events.
But in the minds of the Trump family, rules are meant to be broken.
Sons Eric and Don Jr. have made over $100 million in real estate deals as heads of the Trump Organization while their dad has been in the White House \-- skirting conflict of interest rules designed to keep close family members from profiting off their ties to the White House. The Trump brothers spent almost $250,000 just to take two trips to Dubai in 2017 \-- and all that money came out of taxpayer pockets.
Daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner were brought into the White House despite anti-nepotism laws and raked in up to $135 million in 2019.
And we can’t forget that the president’s re-election strategy has always rested on illegally using his office to secure another term. First Trump was caught and impeached for attempting to coerce information from the Ukrainian government to use against Joe Biden. Now, he is destroying one of our country’s most vital public services, the USPS, in a desperate attempt to disrupt mail-in voting so he can win in November.

The Hill: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Tuesday that she will not meet with President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, calling the nomination an “illegitimate power grab.’”
Senator Warren recognizes that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is set to steal another Supreme Court seat, just like he did in 2016. And he’s chosen his perfect nominee to shape the court forever: Judge Amy Coney Barrett, an extremist who will overturn Roe v. Wade, endorse Trump’s attack on immigrants, strip away voting rights, and let the judiciary become a puppet for corporate interests.
Senator Warren has been a trailblazer from the beginning, doing everything she can to protect our democracy from GOP tyranny this election cycle. She’s advocated for a national vote-by-mail initiative and has pressured Congress to investigate Trump’s multi-millionaire donor, Louis DeJoy, and his destruction of the USPS.
By refusing to meet with Judge Barrett, Senator Warren is standing up to Republican destruction of our third branch of government. But Mitch McConnell is determined to push a vote in the Senate for Trump’s nominee by the end of October.
Senator Warren is counting on us to join her in her fight to save our democracy. We need to know if you’re a supporter, so we must ask:
Do you approve of Elizabeth Warren?
YES NO

Fearing a surge in COVID cases, Tulsa’s top public health official urged President Trump to postpone his June 20 indoor rally.
Trump didn’t listen. Now, the city is seeing a record number of COVID cases.
Large, indoor public gatherings are downright dangerous during this public health crisis. Yet, ever the narcissist, Trump once again put his ego in front of the public health of Americans. As cases rise around the country, Trump continues to downplay the risks. How would you rate Trump’s handling of this public health emergency? Let us know:

Alex,
As Attorney General, William Barr’s major priorities should be to uphold the law and protect the civil liberties of all Americans.
However, after last week’s House Judiciary Committee hearing, it was clear Barr has one priority \-- protecting his boss, Donald Trump.
Barr defended Trump’s false allegations that mail-in ballots would lead to widespread voter fraud. He also toed the administration’s line by rejecting the idea that institutional racism existed within law enforcement.
Most chillingly, Barr called the protests surrounding George Floyd’s death “an assault on the Government of the United States” and justified the presence of federal law enforcement in cities such as Portland and Chicago sent to stop the protests.
As Democratic member Pramila Jayapal noted, the Trump administration only seems to justify this use of force for unarmed Black Lives Matter protesters \-- not the armed right-wing protesters who stormed state capitals earlier in the COVID pandemic. In Jayapal’s words:
“You take an aggressive approach to Black Lives Matter protests but not right-wing extremists threatening to lynch a governor, if it is for the president’s benefit.”
It’s clear Barr doesn’t care about the American people \-- only about aiding and abetting his lawless boss. That’s why we want to hear from you:
Should Attorney General William Barr resign?
YES NO

Alex,
It’s less than 100 days until Election Day \-- and Joe Biden has a double digit lead in the polls.
But Hillary Clinton also had a big lead in 2016 \-- and lost on Election Day.
Winning in November will come down to who votes. But in 2016, nearly 100 million Americans stayed home, as Trump won the White House and Mitch McConnell maintained control of the Senate.
Now, a shocking new Rolling Stone exposé details the GOP’s plans to suppress the vote in 2020: “Blocking ballots, intimidating voters, spreading misinformation – undermining democracy is at the heart of Trump’s 2020 campaign.”
Our mission is to turn out every single eligible Democratic voter in the country. And if we do, Trump will be out of the White House, Mitch McConnell will lose control of the Senate, and Democrats will expand our House majority.
If Democrats control Washington, we’ll expand health care access to every single American in this country. Democrats will take bold action on climate change by expanding green jobs and putting Americans back to work in a new green economy. Democrats will put a stop to the horrendous practice of putting immigrant children in cages and reopen our country with a fair immigration policy. And we’ll expand and protect access to Medicare and Social Security for our seniors and future generations.
But the GOP has raised millions in dark money to target Democratic voters \-- as Donald Trump begins to realize that the only way he can win in November is through voter suppression.
We’re doing everything we can to fight back. And unlike the GOP, we’re a grassroots effort relying on donors like you. But right now, we’re falling VERY SHORT of our fundraising goals.
If we don’t raise another $3,200 by midnight tonight, we’ll have to scale back our work turning out voters who are committed to beat Trump. We’ll have to cut support to Senate and House races around the country. If we fail, Trump will win 4 more years in the White House. The GOP and Mitch McConnell will keep control of the Senate. Trump will nominate 2 or more Supreme Court justices. With the Supreme Court stacked with conservatives, the court could roll back access to choice for millions of women, roll back LGBTQ+ anti-discrimination laws, and repeal Obamacare.
That’s why we need every single committed Democrat to step up right now. Please, we’re asking you to donate now to beat Trump, take back the Senate, and protect the Democratic House majority. With YOUR support right now, Democrats will win, and Trump will be thrown from the White House in the biggest embarrassment of his lifetime.
We cannot thank you enough for all you’re doing every single day to elect Democrats.

Alex,
Trump and the GOP have another trick up their sleeve to steal the election \-- this time it’s an obscure 200-year-old law.
With the Electoral Count Act, Trump’s baseless accusations of Democratic election fraud can trigger a vote from state legislatures to block electoral votes for Joe Biden. There are 29 total Republican-controlled legislatures \-- including Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Those states alone equal 61 total electoral votes that Biden and Trump remain in a neck-in-neck battle for.
We can preemptively block Trump’s imminent ploy by voting in overwhelming numbers this November. If we turn out to defend and expand our House majority, especially in these key states, we would secure the state delegations we need and leave Trump with no choice but to respect the will of the American people.
But the GOP knows this, and for months, they’ve been funneling dark money where it’s needed most. And now, The Cook Political Report has categorized 25 House races as “tossups,” and congressional races will only get tighter as Election Day nears.
Alex, the fact is that there is no boundary that Trump or the GOP won’t cross to steal the election from the American people. You, more than anyone, know that our country simply won’t survive another Trump-Pence term. That’s why we’re asking for your help to turn out Democrats in overwhelming numbers and hand Trump an irrefutable defeat. Will you pitch in now to support our efforts, remove Trump from office, expand our House majority, and take back the Senate in November?

Alex,
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris still hold a comfortable 7 point lead over Donald Trump and Mike Pence, down modestly from their 9.5 point advantage in July.
But The Hill has been quick to point out that hidden Trump voters, his “silent majority,” will undoubtedly shrink the Biden-Harris lead as we approach November \-- and that Trump’s true support could be underestimated by 2 to 3 points, well within the margin of error of most polls.
Donald Trump and Mike Pence can still win \-- just as they were able to overcome Hillary Clinton's and Tim Kaine’s sizable polling leads in 2016. And since then, we have seen federal law enforcement terrorize American cities, the USPS dismantled for political purposes, and over 190,000 Americans die from a pandemic that the Trump administration has failed to take seriously.
All because 100 million voters stayed home on Election Day in 2016.
We’re less than two months away from the most crucial election in our history. The choice is ours: we either stay home and give Donald Trump and Mike Pence another 4 years to cause irreparable harm to our democracy, or we work together to bring much needed change to Washington by electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

Protect RBG’s Legacy,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Amy Coney Barrett showed her true colors in SCOTUS confirmation hearings,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Amy Coney Barrett, when asked about her stance on gay marriage in the United States by the Senate Judiciary Committee, dodged the question and used the phrase “sexual preference,” implying that homosexuality is a choice. She’s since apologized, saying that she “would never mean to use a term that would cause any offense in the LGBTQ community.” But she did use it. And now LGBTQ+ Americans know exactly how Judge Barrett views them.
As Trump’s latest far-right nominee, Barrett’s legal track record includes ruling against reproductive health care and immigrant rights \-- and she has brazenly criticized the Supreme Court for upholding the Affordable Care Act, an Obama-era policy that has made health care more affordable for millions of Americans.
A FiveThirtyEight poll found that over 50% of Americans think that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat should be filled by the next elected president. But rather than listen to the will of the American people, Trump loyalist Mitch McConnell is ramming through Barrett’s confirmation hearings to secure Trump’s far-right control of our highest court before voters can have a say on Election Day. In Mitch McConnell’s own words: “That’s the plan and there’s nothing I can see that would keep that from happening.”
The Washington Post has warned that shifting to a 6-3 Supreme Court Trump majority would be “seismic,” which is why Joe Biden has demanded that Trump’s nominee be withdrawn if Biden wins the election \-- to reflect the true will of the American people. But Republicans are rallying behind Barrett, saying she is exactly “whom the American people deserve to have on their highest court.” The Senate Judiciary Committee approved her nomination on Thursday, so we need to know TODAY:
Do you approve of Amy Coney Barrett?
YES NO

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Kamala Harris demands Trump listen to science,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Earlier this week, Kamala Harris spoke out against the historic wildfires that have killed at least 35 Americans and burned millions of acres in the western United States. “This is not a partisan issue,"" Harris said. “Ideology should not kick in. It's just a fact. And it is incumbent on us, in terms of the leadership [[URL REDACTED]] nation, to take seriously the extreme changes in our climate, and to do what we can to mitigate against the damage.""
But Donald Trump doesn’t agree. During his briefing on the wildfires on Monday, Trump downplayed climate change’s role in the wildfires, blaming them on poor forest management instead. Trump’s response to officials pleading he listen to science and global warming? “It will start getting cooler. You just watch.”
Kamala Harris is ready to protect Americans from Donald Trump’s blatant disregard for science. Are you ready to fight alongside her as Democrats attempt to take back the White House and Senate? We’re preparing our efforts to get Democrats to the polls this fall, but we need to hear from you. One in five Americans don’t believe climate change has played a role in this year’s decimating wildfires, and we need to know now if you support our vice presidential candidate:

Democracy In Action,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Axios: Trump will likely win in a landslide on Election Day,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Axios News has reported it’s likely Trump will win in a landslide on election night \-- or at least appear to, until all the mail-in ballots are counted over the ensuing days and weeks.
Trump will use that opportunity to try to cling to power, building on the foundation he’s laid through casting doubt on vote-by-mail, accusing Democrats of rigging the election, and toying with the idea of disputing the results if Biden wins.
That means the stakes of beating Trump in 2020 have never been higher \-- both on election night, and in the days and weeks that follow.
And it means we cannot stop the important work we’re doing to lock down a Democratic Congress, which would be all the more crucial in a second Trump term. We’re proud to have already endorsed and supported 21 Democrats in the House and the Senate \-- Democrats who are well on their way to victory because of supporters like you. We now need to redouble our outreach efforts to voters in battlegrounds like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania and across the country, and compel Americans to cast their ballots in the most important election of our lifetimes.
We know Republicans will do anything to suppress the vote, legally or otherwise, with their piles of dark money and Trump campaign funds. And we know voter burnout is just as much of a threat as the GOP \-- it feels like this election cycle has been going on forever.
But it won’t last forever. It’s now late September, we’ve got just under 6 weeks until the biggest election of our lives \-- and we’re being outspent. If we don’t turn this around quickly, we’ll have to scale back, which means turning out fewer Democratic votes and giving Republicans a chance to reclaim the House, hold onto the Senate, and keep the White House.
We need to show up in full force this election. That’s why we’re writing to you \-- we know the future of this country weighs heavily on your mind. We hope you’ll help us move this country onto the right path forward.
If you believe in protecting our democracy, we need you now. If you believe in stopping Trump’s destruction of America, we need you now. If you believe in fighting back against GOP voter suppression, we need you now. Please, help us turn out the vote and get Trump out of the White House by giving whatever you can today.

Electoral Protection Action,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,The law Trump could use to steal this election,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
The Atlantic has sounded the alarm on an obscure law Donald Trump could use to steal the election.
Trump has already openly admitted he plans to suppress the vote and use his far-right Supreme Court majority to keep his grasp on power. But he hasn’t been as eager to disclose that, under the Electoral Count Act, Trump can use Republican-held state legislatures to block electoral votes for Joe Biden, triggering a stalemate.
In that case, the election would be decided by a vote of state delegations in the newly elected House of Representatives in 2021 \-- and since we currently hold a Democratic majority in the House but not a majority of state delegations, Republicans in Congress could hand Trump the White House, even if he loses the election.
We can preemptively block Trump’s imminent ploy by voting in overwhelming numbers this November. If we turn out to defend and expand our House majority, especially in key states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Florida, we would secure the state delegations we need to leave Trump with no choice but to respect the will of the American people. But The Cook Political Report has categorized over 25 House races as a “toss up,” and congressional races will only get tighter as Election Day nears. Today, we need your commitment to support Democrats and protect our electoral integrity:
Will you vote for Democrats in November?

Alex,
Former HUD Secretary Julián Castro DEMANDED Congress investigate human rights abuses at ICE detention centers as Trump’s zero-tolerance immigration policy forces thousands of children and families into shameful living conditions in the midst of the world’s largest public health crisis.
Despite already diagnosing over 3,700 cases of COVID-19 at its facilities, ICE has refused to release ANY migrant children or implement necessary public health measures \-- choosing instead to spray them with dangerous chemicals known to cause skin rashes and respiratory illness.
That’s why we’re thankful that, once again, Julián Castro has proven to be a leader who will fight against these inhumane policies \-- and keep others accountable to ensure children and families stay as they should be, healthy and united.
But Trump and the GOP have attacked Castro in the past \-- and now that he’s called out their inhumane policies in no uncertain terms, those attacks will likely only get worse. With the lives of thousands of children, families, and others at risk, we need to hear from you immediately:
Do you stand with Julián Castro?

The good news continues for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Last week, the Democratic ticket had the biggest polling lead heading into the party convention since 1996 with a comfortable seven-point lead on Donald Trump and Mike Pence, according to Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight.
However, FiveThirtyEight’s Geoffrey Skelley and Nathaniel Rakich were quick to point out that the race is entering “a traditionally volatile period for presidential campaigns” and that the Biden-Harris lead would undoubtedly shrink.
Donald Trump and Mike Pence can still win \-- just as they were able to overcome Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine’s sizable polling leads in 2016. And since then, we have seen federal law enforcement terrorize American cities, the USPS dismantled for political purposes, and over 189,000 Americans die from a pandemic that the Trump administration has failed to take seriously.
All because 100 million voters stayed home on Election Day in 2016.

Alex,
The Hill: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Tuesday that she will not meet with President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, calling the nomination an “illegitimate power grab.’”
Senator Warren recognizes that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is set to steal another Supreme Court seat, just like he did in 2016. And he’s chosen his perfect nominee to shape the court forever: Judge Amy Coney Barrett, an extremist who will overturn Roe v. Wade, endorse Trump’s attack on immigrants, strip away voting rights, and let the judiciary become a puppet for corporate interests.
Senator Warren has been a trailblazer from the beginning, doing everything she can to protect our democracy from GOP tyranny this election cycle. She’s advocated for a national vote-by-mail initiative and has pressured Congress to investigate Trump’s multi-millionaire donor, Louis DeJoy, and his destruction of the USPS.
By refusing to meet with Judge Barrett, Senator Warren is standing up to Republican destruction of our third branch of government. But Mitch McConnell is determined to push a vote in the Senate for Trump’s nominee by the end of October.
Senator Warren is counting on us to join her in her fight to save our democracy. We need to know if you’re a supporter, so we must ask:
Do you approve of Elizabeth Warren?

Alex,
POLITICO: “The Agriculture [[URL REDACTED]] mandating that millions of boxes of surplus food for needy families include a letter from President Donald Trump claiming credit for the program.”
In Donald Trump’s latest use of taxpayer dollars for his own re-election campaign, Trump has required millions of food aid boxes to go out with a personal letter stating: “as President, safeguarding the health and well-being of our citizens is one of my highest priorities.” The irony is that these letters will go out to those who’ve been most affected by his failed coronavirus response.
Trump knows he’s en route to defeat this November, and he’s desperately pulling on his executive power to sway voters his way with just weeks to go until the election.
But political veteran Nate Silver has warned us not to count Trump out just yet, stating that his dwindling reelection chances could make him dangerous and that “it’s not hard to imagine him escalating his anti-democratic rhetoric” to hold on to power. We’re standing with Silver because we know that, as in 2016, the polls might not account for Trump’s “silent” supporters \-- and as we perfect our voter outreach strategy it’s crucial we know where you stand:

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Would you support Stacey Abrams for VP?,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Recently Stacey Abrams went on television to defend her qualifications as a vice president, saying, “Part of my response to not becoming governor in 2018 was not to hide my head but to really address the core issues facing our country.”
Ted Cruz went on to mock the popular Democrat on Twitter, calling her “so am-aaaaay-zing.”
When asked if she’d say yes to Biden, Abrams answered, “It would be doing a disservice to every woman of color, every woman of ambition, every child who wants to think beyond their known space for me to say no.” But given GOP attitudes toward her, a Biden/Abrams ticket could be an uphill battle. We need to know:
Would you vote for a Biden/Abrams ticket?
YES NO

Hi Alex,
Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison is closing in on Donald Trump’s favorite senator, South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham. A recent poll by Quinnipiac University showed the two candidates tied in the dark-red Palmetto State.
Considered a long-shot just last year, Harrison has a real chance to take down Graham.
Despite once calling Donald Trump a “race-baiting, xenophobic bigot,"" Graham has become Trump’s staunchest supporter on Capitol Hill \-- leading The Intercept to call Graham “The Most Shameless Man in American Politics.”
Graham led the charge against Democratic impeachment efforts \-- actually arguing that Trump was too stupid to break the law: “What I can tell you about the Trump policy toward Ukraine: It was incoherent, it depends on who you talk to, they seem to be incapable of forming a quid pro quo, so no I find the whole process to be a sham and I'm not going to legitimize it.”
Ultimately, Graham’s support helped keep Trump in office. Now, Trump is undermining the U.S. Postal Service in a desperate attempt to stay in the White House and help vulnerable GOP senators like Graham stay on Capitol Hill.
A Graham defeat would hand Democrats control of the Senate \-- but we need to know where you stand as we shape our strategy to turn out voters this fall. Barack Obama, VP nominee Kamala Harris, and other top Democrats are backing Harrison. Do you also support Jaime Harrison or Trump’s best friend Lindsey Graham? Let us know now:
Do you support Lindsey Graham?
YES NO

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,NBC: Donald Trump's federal budget is bigger than Joe Biden's campaign war chest,"When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
Joe Biden is estimated to have raised over $300 million toward his re-election campaign in the past month, much of it through grassroots fundraising \-- but as impressive as that is, Biden’s campaign can’t compete when Trump is willing to use the federal treasury funds to support his campaign.
NBC put it best: “Trump has demonstrated he is willing and able to use tax dollars to fund his campaign in ways that make monthly fundraising reports look like pocket change.”
This year, the federal government is on pace to allocate $6.6 trillion, and Trump has found countless ways to turn that into political benefits for himself \-- putting his name on $290 billion in stimulus checks, running a coronavirus response campaign “to defeat hope and despair,” and promising to give more federal funds to voters \-- especially in critical swing states.
Trump is using the federal government to win this election in unprecedented ways, and if he’s re-elected, he’ll continue to illegally expand executive power.
Our country simply won’t survive another Trump-Pence term. That’s why we’re planning a new engagement strategy to get Democrats to the polls in overwhelming numbers and support Joe Biden and Kamala Harris this November.
But millions of Democratic voters stayed home in 2016 and handed Donald Trump four years in the White House \-- that’s why we need to know where YOU stand now as November approaches:
This November, I will support:
Joe Biden

Returning to the White House after a weekend trip, Trump responded to Obama by saying to reporters, “Look, he was an incompetent president. That’s all I can say. Grossly incompetent.”
Though Trump may have “had a great weekend,” many Americans can’t say the same. POLITICO reports that, “In April, 20.5 million Americans lost their jobs and unemployment was at 14.7 percent.”
Obama, on the other hand, left office with 75 straight months of job growth and an unemployment rate of 4.7%.

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,Trump votes by mail but says you can't,"When Democrats Turn Out
Hello Alex,
More than one-third of Americans hope to vote by mail in November.
Election officials have said there is no evidence that mail-in-voting results in rampant voter fraud. In fact, over the past 20 years, on average only 0.00006% of mail-in ballots have led to a conviction for fraudulent voting. That’s 143 ballots out of over 250 million.
This year’s election will take place during the country’s largest public health crisis, and voting by mail is an efficient and safe way for many concerned Americans to vote this November.
And yet, unsurprisingly, Trump is opposed to giving Americans that option, continually stating, without evidence, that vote-by-mail will lead to electoral fraud. He also continues to attack the USPS, the largest carrier for mail-in-ballots \-- meanwhile he himself voted by mail earlier this year.
Trump knows that the only way he can win in November is by suppressing the vote, so he’s relying on scare tactics during a global health crisis to prevent Americans from voting safely. And it’s working \-- half of Americans now fear difficulties voting this November.
No one should have to choose between their health and exercising their right to vote. No one should be afraid to cast their ballot. That’s why we’re condemning Trump’s attempts to silence millions this election and demanding Americans have their voices heard through safe voting this November.
Alex, add your name now to DEMAND Congress pass national Vote by Mail before November. With just 2 months left until this crucial election, we need every eligible American’s vote counted to protect our democracy and stand against Trump. Please, add your name to ours now.

This is terrifying. Donald Trump is openly inciting violence against those he sees as his enemies.
Late last week, Trump posted a video from a supporter on Twitter who declares, “The only good Democrat is a dead Democrat.”
The next day, Trump issued a racially-charged threat against protestors in Minneapolis \-- threatening to deploy the National Guard and telling Americans, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.”
There’s no precedent for the President of the United States promoting violence against political opponents and American citizens, but Trump has been doing this since before he was even elected \-- leading rally crowds in chants of “lock her up” and telling his supporters to “knock the crap out of” protestors who disrupt them.

This has stoked widespread fear in his fanatical fanbase, and now this “army” finally has a recruitment center with the resources they need to help him steal the election.

As one expert puts it: “Only massive voter turnout can protect our democracy from Trump [[URL REDACTED]] doesn’t decide who wins the election. We do.”
Trump and the GOP, with the help of dark money, will stop at nothing to build their 50,000-man army. And though early voting seems to be in our favor, we cannot let up on our efforts to turn out Democrats. But right now, we don’t have the funding we need to properly enact our mobilization plan to its fullest potential.

Rachel Maddow urgently warned Americans that Donald Trump is moving towards authoritarianism and is taking steps toward stealing the 2020 election: “If you have authoritarian control, you turn the power of the state to your own purposes. Rather, it’s making you and your family and your staff and your cronies rich. Or rather, it’s using the power of the government you control to ensure that nobody else will be allowed to replace you at the top.”
That’s why Trump put top GOP fundraiser Louis DeJoy in charge of the USPS on the eve of a general election that will be decided largely through mail-in voting.
The drastic changes DeJoy brought to the USPS, including removing neighborhood mailboxes, removing mail-sorting machines from post offices, and delaying mail service have caused chaos around the country \-- and called into question the agency’s ability to handle mail-in voting this November.
That’s by design. His main benefactor and boss, Donald Trump, is not a big fan of mail-in voting, and so DeJoy is doing everything in his power to disrupt this election \-- even if that means destroying the USPS.
And while DeJoy has said he would delay the rest of these changes until after the election, he’s also refusing to reverse the damage he caused in the first place.
Political operatives like DeJoy have no business running the nation’s most vital public service. 78 percent of Americans want the USPS to be fully funded and prepared for this November’s election \-- but that can’t happen with DeJoy at the helm. Do you agree? Let us know now:

“When former Vice President Biden said he would choose a woman, she’s considered by most Americans of all races and all economic backgrounds to be the ultimate woman,” Sharpton told POLITICO. “Look at her book sales. It’s the first time I’ve seen someone write a book that can fill arenas. She has packed more arenas than Donald Trump.”
That’s from POLITICO’s recent reporting that Michelle Obama would be “Biden’s perfect running mate.” The former first lady is not only incredibly popular with Democrats, but is also YouGov’s “most admired woman” globally.
With Joe Biden saying he’d pick Michelle “in a heartbeat,” we want to hear from you:

When Democrats Turn Out,info@whendemocratsturnout.com,"POLITICO: ""In leaked audio, Trump hailed low Black turnout in 2016""","When Democrats Turn Out
Alex,
In a stunning admission, Donald Trump bragged to a group of civil rights leaders on the eve of his inauguration that he was elected president because Black voters stayed home in 2016: “Many Blacks didn’t go out to vote for Hillary ‘cause they liked me. That was almost as good as getting the vote, you know, and it was great.”
And now he’s trying to steal the 2020 election by keeping Black voters home again.
With less than 70 days until Election Day, Joe Biden continues to dominate Donald Trump in general election polls. However, FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver has a warning to those counting the president out already: Trump still has a strong chance to win re-election.
In fact, Silver projects that Trump currently has approximately a 1 in 4 chance to win in November \-- roughly the same chance he gave Trump in 2016.
Trump will win again if voter turnout is low. That’s why he’s interfering with the USPS to disrupt mail-in voting and suing states that are adopting universal vote by mail.
Trump wants to silence American voters. We must fight back. To save our democracy, every Democrat must show up to vote in November. If we do, we can oust Trump from the White House, take back the Senate, and build on our House majority.
We can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump. That’s why we need you to commit to voting TODAY. Will you commit to voting for the Biden-Harris ticket this November?
Will you support the Biden-Harris ticket this November?

538’s Nate Silver thinks that, even with decreasing home state benefits from VP choices, Biden’s pick could still cause enough of a spike to flip an essential swing state.
In a close battleground state like Michigan \-- where Trump won by only 0.3% in 2016 \-- Silver predicts a Gretchen Whitmer pick could give Biden a 1-2 point bump and the state.
And with Newsweek reporting that Trump and Biden are currently in a “dead heat” in several states, it’s never been more clear that the right running mate could make all the difference. Biden has committed to picking a woman, but that’s the only requirement he’s given \-- otherwise, the race is wide open.

These trends are sounding the alarm \-- we need to turn out in overwhelming numbers to defeat Trump in November.

Alex,
Multiple news outlets are reporting that Trump has chosen Judge Amy Coney Barrett to succeed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \-- if that’s true, it means the futures of health care, of safe and legal abortion, and of immigrant rights are all dangling by a thread.
FiveThirtyEight reports that Barrett “is a favorite of conservative Christians in particular, and is widely seen as a justice who would be willing to significantly expand states’ ability to restrict abortion access, or even vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to abortion. She also criticized [Chief Justice] Roberts’s 2012 vote to uphold the Affordable Care Act.” The Supreme Court will hear a case on the Affordable Care Act just after the election \-- with Barrett in, the law could be long gone.
But the polling giant is reporting good news too \-- that Biden has a 77% chance of winning the presidency and that Democrats have a 62% of retaking the Senate. In other words, we could soon control both the executive and legislative branches, meaning we could pass laws to protect Americans, their health care, and their reproductive rights in 2021. We could protect this country and its people from the worst the GOP has to offer.
Unfortunately, Democratic odds may soon change. Trump has just made the most powerful move he possibly could to consolidate support among pro-life Americans \-- in other words, half the country. GOP Senators are hoping their constituents will forget about their failure to provide meaningful relief over the past several months now that the prize of a new Republican justice is within reach \-- and their constituents just might oblige.
We can’t allow Republicans to use their Supreme Court takeover to also seize Congress and the Oval Office. If the GOP gets all three branches of government, we can say goodbye to our civil liberties and to the country we once knew. We MUST elect progressives who will fight to protect the right to choose and the health of millions of vulnerable citizens. But Republicans are about to see a massive swell in donations \-- and we’re currently $9,074 short of our grassroots fundraising goal.
If you want to help us push back against the GOP, help us close this gap \-- and build a shield to protect the Americans who are now more threatened than ever.
Please, give what you can now to elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November. If we fall short now, Republicans will take over our country and we won’t be able to undo the damage for decades to come. That hasn’t happened yet, and this is our one chance to say we did everything we could to stop it.

Alex,
According to reports from the independent chief actuary of the Social Security Administration, Social Security could run out of money by 2023. Trump has halted collection of the taxes that fund the crucial program, and if this doesn’t change by January 2021, Social Security will be gone for good \-- but Trump has promised to permanently end the practice.
Last month, Trump signed an executive order to temporarily stop payroll tax collection, making Social Security’s already limited funds even more vulnerable during a national public health crisis. If he’s re-elected, Trump’s sworn that his temporary delay will become a permanent cut \-- one that will leave millions of Americans without their hard-earned benefits.
With less than 7 weeks until the election, we’re doing everything we can to mobilize voters and give Trump an overwhelming defeat in November. But the GOP is trying to change the narrative around Social Security, arguing that Trump’s cuts won’t affect program funding, despite payroll taxes accounting for over a third of Social Security’s budget.

The Trump administration is suing states to stop their vote-by-mail plans.
And Trump is threatening to send law enforcement officers to monitor the polls this November.
For the sake of our democracy, we MUST step up to keep Donald Trump and the GOP from suppressing the vote this November.
Our mission is to get every single Democratic voter out to the polls. Collectively, we have the power to defeat Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell this November. With Democratic control, we can ensure all Americans have health care, implement a science-based plan to end the COVID-19 crisis, end Trump’s cruel separation of families and adopt a fair immigration policy, and protect Medicare and Social Security for seniors and generations to come.
Right now, polls show that the Biden-Harris ticket is winning. But Republicans are energized and are fighting back. The GOP is raising more money than Democrats and is using that money to fund voter suppression efforts designed to keep Trump and McConnell in power.
We need to organize Democratic voters, but currently don’t have the budget to keep going, and we’re far short of our fundraising goals.
Election Day is only two months away, and we can’t stop our critical organizing work now. But if we don’t raise $2,045 by midnight tonight, we will have to dramatically scale back our strategy. We’ll hand the White House back to Donald Trump and the Senate back to Mitch McConnell.
That’s why we need every single committed Democrat to join us right now so that we can beat Trump, take back the Senate, and protect the Democratic House majority.
It’s time to step up, Democrats. Please, we’re asking you to donate now to defeat Donald Trump’s GOP and reclaim our democracy. With YOUR support right now, Democrats will win, and Trump will be thrown from the White House in the biggest embarrassment of his lifetime.
We cannot thank you enough for your help as we take back our democracy.
